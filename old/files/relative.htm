    <h4>
      A NOTE ON THE AUTHOR OF THE WANDERING JEW: EUGENE SUE <br /><br />
      (1804-1857)
    </h4>
    <p>
      Time and again physicians and seamen have made noteworthy reputations as
      novelists. But it is rare in the annals of literature that a man trained
      in both professions should have gained his greatest fame as a writer of
      novels. Eugene Sue began his career as a physician and surgeon, and then
      spent six years in the French Navy. In 1830, when he returned to France,
      he inherited his father&rsquo;s rich estate and was free to follow his
      inclination to write. His first novel, &ldquo;Plick et Plock&rdquo;, met
      with an unexpected success, and he at once foreswore the arts of healing
      and navigation for the precarious life of a man of letters. With varying
      success he produced books from his inexhaustible store of personal
      experiences as a doctor and sailor. In 1837, he wrote an authoritative
      work on the French Navy, &ldquo;Histoire de la marine Francaise&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more the novel appealed to his imagination and suited his gifts.
      His themes ranged from the fabulous to the strictly historical, and he
      became popular as a writer of romance and fictionized fact. His plays,
      however, were persistent failures. When he published &ldquo;The Mysteries
      of Paris&rdquo;, his national fame was assured, and with the writing of
      &ldquo;The Wandering Jew&rdquo; he achieved world-wide renown. Then, at
      the height of his literary career, Eugene Sue was driven into exile after
      Louis Napoleon overthrew the Constitutional Government in a coup d&rsquo;etat
      and had himself officially proclaimed Emperor Napoleon III. The author of
      &ldquo;The Wandering Jew&rdquo; died in banishment five years later.

    <h2>
      The Land&rsquo;s End of Two Worlds.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Arctic Ocean
      encircles with a belt of eternal ice the desert confines of Siberia and
      North America&mdash;the uttermost limits of the Old and New worlds,
      separated by the narrow, channel, known as Behring&rsquo;s Straits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last days of September have arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equinox has brought with it darkness and Northern storms, and night
      will quickly close the short and dismal polar day. The sky of a dull and
      leaden blue is faintly lighted by a sun without warmth, whose white disk,
      scarcely seen above the horizon, pales before the dazzling, brilliancy of
      the snow that covers, as far as the eyes can reach, the boundless steppes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the North, this desert is bounded by a ragged coast, bristling with
      huge black rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the base of this Titanic mass lied enchained the petrified ocean, whose
      spell-bound waves appear fired as vast ranges of ice mountains, their blue
      peaks fading away in the far-off frost smoke, or snow vapor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the twin-peaks of Cape East, the termination of Siberia, the
      sullen sea is seen to drive tall icebergs across a streak of dead green.
      There lies Behring&rsquo;s Straits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite, and towering over the channel, rise the granite masses of Cape
      Prince of Wales, the headland of North America.
    </p>
    <p>
      These lonely latitudes do not belong to the habitable world; for the
      piercing cold shivers the stones, splits the trees, and causes the earth
      to burst asunder, which, throwing forth showers of icy spangles seems
      capable of enduring this solitude of frost and tempest, of famine and
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, strange to say, footprints may be traced on the snow, covering
      these headlands on either side of Behring&rsquo;s Straits.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the American shore, the footprints are small and light, thus betraying
      the passage of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has been hastening up the rocky peak, whence the drifts of Siberia are
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the latter ground, footprints larger and deeper betoken the passing of
      a man. He also was on his way to the Straits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that this man and woman had arrived here from opposite
      directions, in hope of catching a glimpse of one another, across the arm
      of the sea dividing the two worlds&mdash;the Old and the New.
    </p>
    <p>
      More strange still! the man and the woman have crossed the solitudes
      during a terrific storm! Black pines, the growth of centuries, pointing
      their bent heads in different parts of the solitude like crosses in a
      churchyard, have been uprooted, rent, and hurled aside by the blasts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the two travellers face this furious tempest, which has plucked up
      trees, and pounded the frozen masses into splinters, with the roar of
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      They face it, without for one single instant deviating from the straight
      line hitherto followed by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who then are these two beings who advance thus calmly amidst the storms
      and convulsions of nature?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it by chance, or design, or destiny, that the seven nails in the sole
      of the man&rsquo;s shoe form a cross&mdash;thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               *
            * * *
               *
               *
               *
</pre>
    <p>
      Everywhere he leaves this impress behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the smooth and polished snow, these footmarks seem imprinted by a foot
      of brass on a marble floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night without twilight has soon succeeded day&mdash;a night of foreboding
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant reflection of the snow renders the white steppes still
      visible beneath the azure darkness of the sky; and the pale stars glimmer
      on the obscure and frozen dome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solemn silence reigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, towards the Straits, a faint light appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, a gentle, bluish light, such as precedes moonrise; it increases
      in brightness, and assumes a ruddy hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness thickens in every other direction; the white wilds of the desert
      are now scarcely visible under the black vault of the firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange and confused noises are heard amidst this obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sound like the flight of large night&mdash;birds&mdash;now flapping
      now-heavily skimming over the steppes-now descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no cry is heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This silent terror heralds the approach of one of those imposing phenomena
      that awe alike the most ferocious and the most harmless, of animated
      beings. An Aurora Borealis (magnificent sight!) common in the polar
      regions, suddenly beams forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half circle of dazzling whiteness becomes visible in the horizon.
      Immense columns of light stream forth from this dazzling centre, rising to
      a great height, illuminating earth, sea, and sky. Then a brilliant
      reflection, like the blaze of a conflagration, steals over the snow of the
      desert, purples the summits of the mountains of ice, and imparts a dark
      red hue to the black rocks of both continents.
    </p>
    <p>
      After attaining this magnificent brilliancy, the Northern Lights fade away
      gradually, and their vivid glow is lost in a luminous fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, by a wondrous mirage an effect very common in high latitudes,
      the American Coast, though separated from Siberia by a broad arm of the
      sea, loomed so close that a bridge might seemingly be thrown from one
      world to other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then human forms appeared in the transparent azure haze overspreading both
      forelands.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Siberian Cape, a man on his knees, stretched his arms towards
      America, with an expression of inconceivable despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the American promontory, a young and handsome woman replied to the man&rsquo;s
      despairing gesture by pointing to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some seconds, these two tall figures stood out, pale and shadowy, in
      the farewell gleams of the Aurora.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fog thickens, and all is lost in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence came the two beings, who met thus amidst polar glaciers, at the
      extremities of the Old and New worlds?
    </p>
    <p>
      Who were the two creatures, brought near for a moment by a deceitful
      mirage, but who seemed eternally separated?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. MOROK.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The month of October, 1831, draws to its close.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span> hough it is still
      day, a brass lamp, with four burners, illumines the cracked walls of a
      large loft, whose solitary window is closed against outer light. A ladder,
      with its top rungs coming up through an open trap leads to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there at random on the floor lie iron chains, spiked collars,
      saw-toothed snaffles, muzzles bristling with nails, and long iron rods set
      in wooden handles. In one corner stands a portable furnace, such as
      tinkers use to melt their spelter; charcoal and dry chips fill it, so that
      a spark would suffice to kindle this furnace in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from this collection of ugly instruments, putting one in mind of a
      torturer&rsquo;s kit of tools, there are some articles of defence and
      offence of a bygone age. A coat of mail, with links so flexible, close,
      and light, that it resembles steel tissue, hangs from a box beside iron
      cuishes and arm-pieces, in good condition, even to being properly fitted
      with straps. A mace, and two long three-cornered-headed pikes, with ash
      handles, strong, and light at the same time; spotted with lately-shed
      blood, complete the armory, modernized somewhat by the presence of two
      Tyrolese rifles, loaded and primed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with this arsenal of murderous weapons and out-of-date instruments,
      is strangely mingled a collection of very different objects, being small
      glass-lidded boxes, full of rosaries, chaplets, medals, AGNUS DEI, holy
      water bottles, framed pictures of saints, etc., not to forget a goodly
      number of those chapbooks, struck off in Friburg on coarse bluish paper,
      in which you can hear about miracles of our own time, or &ldquo;Jesus
      Christ&rsquo;s Letter to a true believer,&rdquo; containing awful
      predictions, as for the years 1831 and &lsquo;32, about impious
      revolutionary France.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those canvas daubs, with which strolling showmen adorn their
      booths, hangs from a rafter, no doubt to prevent its being spoilt by too
      long rolling up. It bore the following legend:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;THE DOWNRIGHT TRUE AND MOST MEMORABLE CONVERSION OF IGNATIUS MOROK,
 KNOWN AS THE PROPHET, HAPPENING IN FRIBURG, 1828TH YEAR OF GRACE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This picture, of a size larger than natural, of gaudy color, and in bad
      taste, is divided into three parts, each presenting an important phase in
      the life of the convert, surnamed &ldquo;The Prophet.&rdquo; In the first,
      behold a long-bearded man, the hair almost white, with uncouth face, and
      clad in reindeer skin, like the Siberian savage. His black foreskin cap is
      topped with a raven&rsquo;s head; his features express terror. Bent
      forward in his sledge, which half-a-dozen huge tawny dogs draw over the
      snow, he is fleeing from the pursuit of a pack of foxes, wolves, and big
      bears, whose gaping jaws, and formidable teeth, seem quite capable of
      devouring man, sledge, and dogs, a hundred times over. Beneath this
      section, reads:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;IN 1810, MOROK, THE IDOLATER, FLED FROM WILD BEASTS.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the second picture, Morok, decently clad in a catechumen&rsquo;s white
      gown kneels, with clasped hands, to a man who wears a white neckcloth, and
      flowing black robe. In a corner, a tall angel, of repulsive aspect, holds
      a trumpet in one hand, and flourishes a flaming sword with the other,
      while the words which follow flow out of his mouth, in red letters on a
      black ground:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;MOROK, THE IDOLATER, FLED FROM WILD BEASTS; BUT WILD BEASTS WILL FLEE
 FROM IGNATIUS MOROK, CONVERTED AND BAPTIZED IN FRIBURG.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thus, in the last compartment, the new convert proudly, boastfully, and
      triumphantly parades himself in a flowing robe of blue; head up, left arm
      akimbo, right hand outstretched, he seems to scare the wits out of a
      multitude of lions, tigers, hyenas, and bears, who, with sheathed claws,
      and masked teeth, crouch at his feet, awestricken, and submissive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this, is the concluding moral:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;IGNATIUS MOROK BEING CONVERTED, WILD BEASTS CROUCH BEFORE HIM.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Not far from this canvas are several parcels of halfpenny books, likewise
      from the Friburg press, which relate by what an astounding miracle Morok,
      the Idolater, acquired a supernatural power almost divine, the moment he
      was converted&mdash;a power which the wildest animal could not resist, and
      which was testified to every day by the lion tamer&rsquo;s performances,
      &ldquo;given less to display his courage than to show his praise unto the
      Lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the trap-door which opens into the loft, reek up puffs of a rank,
      sour, penetrating odor. From time to time are heard sonorous growls and
      deep breathings, followed by a dull sound, as of great bodies stretching
      themselves heavily along the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man is alone in this loft. It is Morok, the tamer of wild beasts,
      surnamed the Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is forty years old, of middle height, with lank limbs, and an
      exceedingly spare frame; he is wrapped in a long, blood-red pelisse, lined
      with black fur; his complexion, fair by nature is bronzed by the wandering
      life he has led from childhood; his hair, of that dead yellow peculiar to
      certain races of the Polar countries, falls straight and stiff down his
      shoulders; and his thin, sharp, hooked nose, and prominent cheek-bones,
      surmount a long beard, bleached almost to whiteness. Peculiarly marking
      the physiognomy of this man is the wide open eye, with its tawny pupil
      ever encircled by a rim of white. This fixed, extraordinary look,
      exercises a real fascination over animals&mdash;which, however, does not
      prevent the Prophet from also employing, to tame them, the terrible
      arsenal around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at a table, he has just opened the false bottom of a box, filled
      with chaplets and other toys, for the use of the devout. Beneath this
      false bottom, secured by a secret lock, are several sealed envelopes, with
      no other address than a number, combined with a letter of the alphabet.
      The Prophet takes one of these packets, conceals it in the pocket of his
      pelisse, and, closing the secret fastening of the false bottom, replaces
      the box upon a shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scene occurs about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, in the White
      Falcon, the only hostelry in the little village of Mockern, situated near
      Leipsic, as you come from the north towards France.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments, the loft is shaken by a hoarse roaring from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judas! be quiet!&rdquo; exclaims the Prophet, in a menacing tone,
      as he turns his head towards the trap door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another deep growl is heard, formidable as distant thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down, Cain!&rdquo; cries Morok, starting from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third roar, of inexpressible ferocity, bursts suddenly on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death! Will you have done,&rdquo; cries the Prophet, rushing
      towards the trap door, and addressing a third invisible animal, which
      bears this ghastly name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the habitual authority of his voice&mdash;notwithstanding
      his reiterated threats&mdash;the brute-tamer cannot obtain silence: on the
      contrary, the barking of several dogs is soon added to the roaring of the
      wild beasts. Morok seizes a pike, and approaches the ladder; he is about
      to descend, when he sees some one issuing from the aperture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer has a brown, sun-burnt face; he wears a gray hat, bell
      crowned and broad-brimmed, with a short jacket, and wide trousers of green
      cloth; his dusty leathern gaiters show that he has walked some distance; a
      game-bag is fastened by straps to his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take the brutes!&rdquo; cried he, as he set foot on the
      floor; &ldquo;one would think they&rsquo;d forgotten me in three days.
      Judas thrust his paw through the bars of his cage, and Death danced like a
      fury. They don&rsquo;t know me any more, it seems?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in German. Morok answered in the same language, but with a
      slightly foreign accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good or bad news, Karl?&rdquo; he inquired, with some uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve met them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday; two leagues from Wittenberg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; cried Morok, clasping his hands with
      intense satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, &lsquo;tis the direct road from Russia to France,
      &lsquo;twas a thousand to one that we should find them somewhere between
      Wittenberg and Leipsic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the description?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very close: two young girls in mourning; horse, white; the old man
      has long moustache, blue forage-cap; gray topcoat and a Siberian dog at
      his heels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did you leave them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A league hence. They will be here within the hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in this inn&mdash;since it is the only one in the village,&rdquo;
      said Morok, with a pensive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And night drawing on,&rdquo; added Karl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get the old man to talk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&mdash;you don&rsquo;t suppose it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, and try yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for what reason?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible&mdash;why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know all about it. Yesterday, as if I had fallen in with
      them by chance, I followed them to the place where they stopped for the
      night. I spoke in German to the tall old man, accosting him, as is usual
      with wayfarers, &lsquo;Good-day, and a pleasant journey, comrade!&rsquo;
      But, for an answer, he looked askant at me, and pointed with, the end of
      his stick to the other side of the road.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Frenchman, and, perhaps, does not understand German.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks it, at least as well as you; for at the inn I heard him
      ask the host for whatever he and the young girls wanted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you not again attempt to engage him in conversation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once only; but I met with such a rough reception, that for fear of
      making mischief, I did not try again. Besides, between ourselves, I can
      tell you this man has a devilish ugly look; believe me, in spite of his
      gray moustache, he looks so vigorous and resolute, though with no more
      flesh on him than a carcass, that I don&rsquo;t know whether he or my mate
      Giant Goliath, would have the best of it in a struggle. I know not your
      plans: only take care, master&mdash;take care!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My black panther of Java was also very vigorous and very vicious,&rdquo;
      said Morok, with a grim, disdainful, smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Death? Yes; in truth; and she is vigorous and vicious as
      ever. Only to you she is almost mild.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus I will break this tall old man; notwithstanding his
      strength and surliness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! humph! be on your guard, master. You are clever, you are as
      brave as any one; but, believe me, you will never make a lamb out of the
      old wolf that will be here presently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not my lion, Cain&mdash;does not my tiger, Judas, crouch in
      terror before me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe you there&mdash;because you have means&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have faith: that is all&mdash;and it is all,&rdquo; said
      Morok, imperiously interrupting Karl, and accompanying these words with
      such a look, that the other hung his head and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should not he whom the Lord upholds in his struggle with wild
      beasts, be also upheld in his struggle with men, when those men are
      perverse and impious?&rdquo; added the Prophet, with a triumphant,
      inspired air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from belief in his master&rsquo;s conviction, or from inability to
      engage in a controversy with him on so delicate a subject, Karl answered
      the Prophet, humbly: &ldquo;you are wiser than I am, master; what you do
      must be well done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you follow this old man and these two young girls all day long?&rdquo;
      resumed the Prophet, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but at a distance. As I know the country well, I sometimes cut
      across a valley, sometimes over a hill, keeping my eye upon the road,
      where they were always to be seen. The last time I saw them, I was hid
      behind the water-mill by the potteries. As they were on the highway for
      this place, and night was drawing on, I quickened my pace to get here
      before them, and be the bearer of what you call good news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good&mdash;yes&mdash;very good: and you shall be rewarded; for
      if these people had escaped me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet started, and did not conclude the sentence. The expression of
      his face, and the tones of his voice, indicated the importance of the
      intelligence which had just been brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; rejoined Karl, &ldquo;it may be worth attending
      to; for that Russian courier, all plastered with lace, who came, without
      slacking bridle, from St. Petersburg to Leipsic, only to see you, rode so
      fast, perhaps, for the purpose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok abruptly interrupted Karl, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that the arrival of the courier had anything to do
      with these travellers? You are mistaken; you should only know what I
      choose to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, master, forgive me, and let&rsquo;s say no more about it. So!
      I will get rid of my game-bag, and go help Goliath to feed the brutes, for
      their supper time draws near, if it is not already past. Does our big
      giant grow lazy, master?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goliath is gone out; he must not know that you are returned; above
      all, the tall old man and the maidens must not see you here&mdash;it would
      make them suspect something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you wish me to go, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the loft, at the end of the stable, and wait my orders; you
      may this night have to set out for Leipsic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please; I have some provisions left in my pouch, and can sup
      in the loft whilst I rest myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master, remember what I told you. Beware of that old fellow with
      the gray moustache; I think he&rsquo;s devilish tough; I&rsquo;m up to
      these things&mdash;he&rsquo;s an ugly customer&mdash;be on your guard!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite easy! I am always on my guard,&rdquo; said Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then good luck to you, master!&rdquo;&mdash;and Karl, having
      reached the ladder, suddenly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      After making a friendly farewell gesture to his servant, the Prophet
      walked up and down for some time, with an air of deep meditation; then,
      approaching the box which contained the papers, he took out a pretty long
      letter, and read it over and over with profound attention. From time to
      time he rose and went to the closed window, which looked upon the inner
      court of the inn, and appealed to listen anxiously; for he waited with
      impatience the arrival of the three persons whose approach had just been
      announced to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE TRAVELLERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the above
      scene was passing in the White Falcon at Mockern, the three persons whose
      arrival Morok was so anxiously expecting, travelled on leisurely in the
      midst of smiling meadows, bounded on one side by a river, the current of
      which turned a mill; and on the other by the highway leading to the
      village, which was situated on an eminence, at about a league&rsquo;s
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was beautifully serene; the bubbling of the river, beaten by the
      mill-wheel and sparkling with foam, alone broke upon the silence of an
      evening profoundly calm. Thick willows, bending over the river, covered it
      with their green transparent shadow; whilst, further on, the stream
      reflected so splendidly the blue heavens and the glowing tints of the
      west, that, but for the hills which rose between it and the sky, the gold
      and azure of the water would have mingled in one dazzling sheet with the
      gold and azure of the firmament. The tall reeds on the bank bent their
      black velvet heads beneath the light breath of the breeze that rises at
      the close of day&mdash;for the sun was gradually sinking behind a broad
      streak of purple clouds, fringed with fire. The tinkling bells of a flock
      of sheep sounded from afar in the clear and sonorous air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along a path trodden in the grass of the meadow, two girls, almost
      children&mdash;for they had but just completed their fifteenth year&mdash;were
      riding on a white horse of medium size, seated upon a large saddle with a
      back to it, which easily took them both in, for their figures were slight
      and delicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of tall stature, with a sun-burnt face, and long gray moustache, was
      leading the horse by the bridle, and ever and anon turned towards the
      girls, with an air of solicitude at once respectful and paternal. He
      leaned upon a long staff; his still robust shoulders carried a soldier&rsquo;s
      knapsack; his dusty shoes, and step that began to drag a little, showed
      that he had walked a long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those dogs which the tribes of Northern Siberia harness to their
      sledges&mdash;a sturdy animal, nearly of the size, form, and hairy coat of
      the wolf&mdash;followed closely in the steps of the leader of this little
      caravan, never quitting, as it is commonly said, the heels of his master.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10033m.jpg" alt="10033m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10033.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more charming than the group formed by the girls. One
      held with her left hand the flowing reins, and with her right encircled
      the waist of her sleeping sister, whose head reposed on her shoulder. Each
      step of the horse gave a graceful swaying to these pliant forms, and swung
      their little feet, which rested on a wooden ledge in lieu of a stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      These twin sisters, by a sweet maternal caprice, had been called Rose and
      Blanche; they were now orphans, as might be seen by their sad mourning
      vestments, already much worn. Extremely, like in feature, and of the same
      size, it was necessary to be in the constant habit of seeing them, to
      distinguish one from the other. The portrait of her who slept not, might
      serve them for both of them; the only difference at the moment being, that
      Rose was awake and discharging for that day the duties of elder sister&mdash;duties
      thus divided between then, according to the fancy of their guide, who,
      being an old soldier of the empire, and a martinet, had judged fit thus to
      alternate obedience and command between the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greuze would have been inspired by the sight of those sweet faces, coifed
      in close caps of black velvet, from beneath which strayed a profusion of
      thick ringlets of a light chestnut color, floating down their necks and
      shoulders, and setting, as in a frame, their round, firm, rosy, satin like
      cheeks. A carnation, bathed in dew, is of no richer softness than their
      blooming lips; the wood violet&rsquo;s tender blue would appear dark
      beside the limpid azure of their large eyes, in which are depicted the
      sweetness of their characters, and the innocence of their age; a pure and
      white forehead, small nose, dimpled chin, complete these graceful
      countenances, which present a delightful blending of candor and
      gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have seen them too, when, on the threatening of rain or storm,
      the old soldier carefully wrapped them both in a large pelisse of reindeer
      fur, and pulled over their heads the ample hood of this impervious
      garment; then nothing could be more lovely than those fresh and smiling
      little faces, sheltered beneath the dark-colored cowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the evening was fine and calm; the heavy cloak hung in folds about
      the knees of the sisters, and the hood rested on the back of their saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, still encircling with her right arm the waist of her sleeping
      sister, contemplated her with an expression of ineffable tenderness, akin
      to maternal; for Rose was the eldest for the day, and an elder sister is
      almost a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only, did the orphans idolize each other; but, by a psychological
      phenomenon, frequent with twins, they were almost always simultaneously
      affected; the emotion of one was reflected instantly in the countenance of
      the other; the same cause would make both of them start or blush, so
      closely did their young hearts beat in unison; all ingenuous joys, all
      bitter griefs were mutually felt, and shared in a moment between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their infancy, simultaneously attacked by a severe illness, like two
      flowers on the same steam, they had drooped, grown pale, and languished
      together; but together also had they again found the pure, fresh hues of
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Need it be said, that those mysterious, indissoluble links which united
      the twins, could not have been broken without striking a mortal blow at
      the existence of the poor children?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the sweet birds called love-birds, only living in pairs, as if
      endowed with a common life, pine, despond, and die, when parted by a
      barbarous hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guide of the orphans, a man of about fifty-five, distinguished by his
      military air and gait, preserved the immortal type of the warriors of the
      republic and the empire&mdash;some heroic of the people, who became, in
      one campaign, the first soldiers in the world&mdash;to prove what the
      people can do, have done, and will renew, when the rulers of their choice
      place in them confidence, strength, and their hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soldier, guide of the sisters, and formerly a horse-grenadier of the
      Imperial Guard, had been nicknamed Dagobert. His grave, stern countenance
      was strongly marked; his long, gray, and thick moustache completely
      concealed his upper lip, and united with a large imperial, which almost
      covered his chin; his meagre cheeks, brick-colored, and tanned as
      parchment, were carefully shaven; thick eyebrows, still black, overhung
      and shaded his light blue eyes; gold ear-rings reached down to his
      white-edged military stock; his topcoat, of coarse gray cloth, was
      confined at the waist by a leathern belt; and a blue foraging cap, with a
      red tuft falling on his left shoulder, covered his bald head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once endowed with the strength of Hercules, and having still the heart of
      a lion&mdash;kind and patient, because he was courageous and strong&mdash;Dagobert,
      notwithstanding his rough exterior, evinced for his orphan charges an
      exquisite solicitude, a watchful kindness, and a tenderness almost
      maternal. Yes, motherly; for the heroism of affection dwells alike in the
      mother&rsquo;s heart and the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoically calm, and repressing all emotion, the unchangeable coolness of
      Dagobert never failed him; and, though few were less given to drollery, he
      was now and then highly comic, by reason of the imperturbable gravity with
      which he did everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, as they journeyed on, Dagobert would turn to bestow a
      caress or friendly word on the good white home upon which the orphans were
      mounted. Its furrowed sides and long teeth betrayed a venerable age. Two
      deep scars, one on the flank and the other on the chest, proved that his
      horse had been present in hot battles; nor was it without an act of pride
      that he sometimes shook his old military bridle, the brass stud of which
      was still adorned with an embossed eagle. His pace was regular, careful,
      and steady; his coat sleek, and his bulk moderate; the abundant foam,
      which covered his bit, bore witness to that health which horses acquire by
      the constant, but not excessive, labor of a long journey, performed by
      short stages. Although he had been more than six months on the road, this
      excellent animal carried the orphans, with a tolerably heavy portmanteau
      fastened to the saddle, as freely as on the day they started.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have spoken of the excessive length of the horse&rsquo;s teeth&mdash;the
      unquestionable evidence of great age&mdash;it is chiefly because he often
      displayed them, for the sole purpose of acting up to his name (he was
      called Jovial), by playing a mischievous trick, of which the dog was the
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter, who, doubtless for the sake of contrast, was called
      Spoil-sport (Rabat-joie), being always at his master&rsquo;s heels, found
      himself within the reach of Jovial, who from time to time nipped him
      delicately by the nape of the neck, lifted him from the ground, and
      carried him thus for a moment. The dog, protected by his thick coat, and
      no doubt long accustomed to the practical jokes of his companion,
      submitted to all this with stoical complacency; save that, when he thought
      the jest had lasted long enough, he would turn his head and growl. Jovial
      understood him at the first hint, and hastened to set him down again. At
      other times, just to avoid monotony, Jovial would gently bite the knapsack
      of the soldier, who seemed, as well as the dog, to be perfectly accustomed
      to his pleasantries.
    </p>
    <p>
      These details will give a notion of the excellent understanding that
      existed between the twin sisters, the old soldier, the horse, and the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little caravan proceeded on its ways anxious to reach, before night,
      the village of Mockern, which was now visible on the summit of a hill.
      Ever and anon, Dagobert looked around him, and seemed to be gathering up
      old recollections; by degrees, his countenance became clouded, and when he
      was at a little distance from the mill, the noise of which had arrested
      his attention, he stopped, and drew his long moustache several times
      between his finger and thumb, the only sign which revealed in him any
      strong and concentrated feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jovial, having stopped short behind his master, Blanche, awakened suddenly
      by the shock, raised her head; her first look sought her sister, on whom
      she smiled sweetly; then both exchanged glances of surprise, on seeing
      Dagobert motionless, with his hands clasped and resting on his long staff,
      apparently affected by some painful and deep emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans just chanced to be at the foot of a little mound, the summit
      of which was buried in the thick foliage of a huge oak, planted half way
      down the slope. Perceiving that Dagobert continued motionless and absorbed
      in thought, Rose leaned over her saddle, and, placing her little white
      hand on the shoulder of their guide, whose back was turned towards her,
      said to him, in a soft voice, &ldquo;Whatever is the matter with you,
      Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran turned; to the great astonishment of the sisters, they
      perceived a large tear, which traced its humid furrow down his tanned
      cheek, and lost itself in his thick moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weeping&mdash;you!&rdquo; cried Rose and Blanche together,
      deeply moved. &ldquo;Tell us, we beseech, what is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moments hesitation, the soldier brushed his horny hand across his
      eyes, and said to the orphans in a faltering voice, whilst he pointed to
      the old oak beside them: &ldquo;I shall make you sad, my poor children:
      and yet what I&rsquo;m going to tell you has something sacred in it. Well,
      eighteen years ago, on the eve of the great battle of Leipsic, I carried
      your father to this very tree. He had two sabre-cuts on the head, a musket
      ball in his shoulder; and it was here that he and I&mdash;who had got two
      thrust of a lance for my share&mdash;were taken prisoners; and by whom,
      worse luck?&mdash;why, a renegado! By a Frenchman&mdash;an emigrant
      marquis, then colonel in the service of Russia&mdash;and who afterwards&mdash;but
      one day you shall know all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran paused; then, pointing with his staff to the village of
      Mockern, he added: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I can recognize the spot. Yonder are
      the heights where your brave father&mdash;who commanded us, and the Poles
      of the Guard&mdash;overthrew the Russian Cuirassiers, after having carried
      the battery. Ah, my children!&rdquo; continued the soldier, with the
      utmost simplicity, &ldquo;I wish you had, seen your brave father, at the
      head of our brigade of horse, rushing on in a desperate charge in the
      thick of a shower of shells!&mdash;There was nothing like it&mdash;not a
      soul so grand as he!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Dagobert thus expressed, in his own way, his regrets and
      recollections, the two orphans&mdash;by a spontaneous movement, glided
      gently from the horse, and holding each other by the hand, went together
      to kneel at the foot of the old oak. And there, closely pressed in each
      other&rsquo;s arms, they began to weep; whilst the soldier, standing
      behind them, with his hands crossed on his long staff, rested his bald
      front upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come you must not fret,&rdquo; said he softly, when, after a
      pause of a few minutes, he saw tears run down the blooming cheeks of Rose
      and Blanche, still on their knees. &ldquo;Perhaps we may find General
      Simon in Paris,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;I will explain all that to you
      this evening at the inn. I purposely waited for this day, to tell you many
      things about your father; it was an idea of mine, because this day is a
      sort of anniversary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We weep because we think also of our mother,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of our mother, whom we shall only see again in heaven,&rdquo; added
      Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier raised the orphans, took each by the hand, and gazing from one
      to the other with ineffable affection, rendered still the more touching by
      the contrast of his rude features, &ldquo;You must not give way thus, my
      children,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is true your mother was the best of
      women. When she lived in Poland, they called her the Pearl of Warsaw&mdash;it
      ought to have been the Pearl of the Whole World&mdash;for in the whole
      world you could not have found her match. No&mdash;no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Dagobert faltered; he paused, and drew his long gray
      moustache between finger and thumb, as was his habit. &ldquo;Listen, my
      girls,&rdquo; he resumed, when he had mastered his emotion; &ldquo;your
      mother could give you none but the best advice, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what instructions did she give you before she died? To think
      often of her, but without grieving?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; she told us than our Father in heaven, always good to
      poor mothers whose children are left on earth, would permit her to hear us
      from above,&rdquo; said Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that her eyes would be ever fixed upon us,&rdquo; added Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two, by a spontaneous impulse, replete with the most touching
      grace, joined hands, raised their innocent looks to heaven, and exclaimed,
      with that beautiful faith natural to their age: &ldquo;Is it not so,
      mother?&mdash;thou seest us?&mdash;thou hearest us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since your mother sees and hears you,&rdquo; said Dagobert, much
      moved, &ldquo;do not grieve her by fretting. She forbade you to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Dagobert. We will not cry any more.&rdquo;&mdash;And
      the orphans dried their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, in the opinion of the devout, would have passed for a very
      heathen. In Spain, he had found pleasure in cutting down those monks of
      all orders and colors, who, bearing crucifix in one hand, and poniard in
      the other, fought not for liberty&mdash;the Inquisition had strangled her
      centuries ago&mdash;but, for their monstrous privileges. Yet, in forty
      years, Dagobert had witnessed so many sublime and awful scenes&mdash;he
      had been so many times face to face with death&mdash;that the instinct of
      natural religion, common to every simple, honest heart, had always
      remained uppermost in his soul. Therefore, though he did not share in the
      consoling faith of the two sisters, he would have held as criminal any
      attempt to weaken its influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing them this downcast, he thus resumed: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my
      pretty ones: I prefer to hear you chat as you did this morning and
      yesterday&mdash;laughing at times, and answering me when I speak, instead
      of being so much engrossed with your own talk. Yes, yes, my little ladies!
      you seem to have had famous secrets together these last two days&mdash;so,
      much the better, if it amuses you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters colored, and exchanged a subdued smile, which contrasted with
      the tears that yet filled their eyes, and Rose said to the soldier, with a
      little embarrassment. &ldquo;No, I assure you, Dagobert, we talk of
      nothing in particular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; I don&rsquo;t wish to know it. Come, rest yourselves, a
      few moments more, and then we must start again; for it grows late, and we
      have to reach Mockern before night, so that we may be early on the road
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we still a long, long way to go?&rdquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, to reach Paris? Yes, my children; some hundred days&rsquo;
      march. We don&rsquo;t travel quick, but we get on; and we travel cheap,
      because we have a light purse. A closet for you, a straw mattress and a
      blanket at your door for me, with Spoil-sport on my feet, and a clean
      litter for old Jovial, these are our whole traveling expenses. I say
      nothing about food, because you two together don&rsquo;t eat more than a
      mouse, and I have learnt in Egypt and Spain to be hungry only when it
      suits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not forgetting that, to save still more, you do all the cooking for
      us, and will not even let us assist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think, good Dagobert, that you wash almost every evening at
      our resting-place. As if it were not for us to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said the soldier, interrupting Blanche, &ldquo;I, allow
      you to chap your pretty little hands in soap-suds! Pooh! don&rsquo;t a
      soldier on a campaign always wash his own linen? Clumsy as you see me, I
      was the best washerwoman in my squadron&mdash;and what a hand at ironing!
      Not to make a brag of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;you can iron well&mdash;very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only sometimes, there will be a little singe,&rdquo; said Rose,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah! when the iron is too hot. Zounds! I may bring it as near my
      cheek as I please; my skin is so tough that I don&rsquo;t feel the heat,&rdquo;
      said Dagobert, with imperturbable gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are only jesting, good Dagobert!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, children, if you think that I know my trade as a washerwoman,
      let me continue to have your custom: it is cheaper; and, on a journey,
      poor people like us should save where we can, for we must, at all events,
      keep enough to reach Paris. Once there, our papers and the medal you wear
      will do the rest&mdash;I hope so, at least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This medal is sacred to us; mother gave it to us on her death-bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, take great care that you do not lose it: see, from time
      to time, that you have it safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Blanche, as she drew from her bosom a small
      bronze medal, which she wore suspended from her neck by a chain of the
      same material. The medal bore on its faces the following inscriptions:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 Victim
                  of
               L. C. D. J.
               Pray for me!
                   &mdash;&mdash;
                  Paris
            February the, 13th, 1682.

                At Paris.
            Rue Saint Francois, No. 3,
            In a century and a half
               you will be.
            February the 13th, 1832.
                   &mdash;&mdash;
                PRAY FOR ME!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean, Dagobert?&rdquo; resumed Blanche, as she
      examined the mournful inscriptions. &ldquo;Mother was not able to tell us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will discuss all that this evening; at the place where we sleep,&rdquo;
      answered Dagobert. &ldquo;It grows late, let us be moving. Put up the
      medal carefully, and away!&mdash;We have yet nearly an hour&rsquo;s march
      to arrive at quarters. Come, my poor pets, once more look at the mound
      where your brave father fell&mdash;and then&mdash;to horse! to horse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans gave a last pious glance at the spot which had recalled to
      their guide such painful recollections, and, with his aid, remounted
      Jovial.
    </p>
    <p>
      This venerable animal had not for one moment dreamed of moving; but, with
      the consummate forethought of a veteran, he had made the best use of his
      time, by taking from that foreign soil a large contribution of green and
      tender grass, before the somewhat envious eyes of Spoil-sport, who had
      comfortably established himself in the meadow, with his snout protruding
      between his fore-paws. On the signal of departure, the dog resumed his
      post behind his master, and Dagobert, trying the ground with the end of
      his long staff, led the horse carefully along by the bridle, for the
      meadow was growing more and more marshy; indeed, after advancing a few
      steps, he was obliged to turn off to the left, in order to regain the
      high-road.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Mockern, Dagobert asked for the least expensive inn, and was
      told there was only one in the village&mdash;the White Falcon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE ARRIVAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>lready had Morok
      several times opened with impatience the window shutters of the loft, to
      look out upon the inn-yard, watching for the arrival of the orphans and
      the soldier. Not seeing them, he began once more to walk slowly up and
      down, with his head bent forward, and his arms folded on his bosom,
      meditating on the best means to carry out the plan he had conceived. The
      ideas which possessed his mind, were, doubtless, of a painful character,
      for his countenance grew even more gloomy than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his ferocious appearance, he was by no means deficient in
      intelligence. The courage displayed in his taming exercises (which he
      gravely attributed to his recent conversion), a solemn and mystical style
      of speech, and a hypocritical affectation of austerity, had given him a
      species of influence over the people he visited in his travels. Long
      before his conversion, as may well be supposed, Morok had been familiar
      with the habits of wild beasts. In fact born in the north of Siberia, he
      had been, from his boyhood, one of the boldest hunters of bears and
      reindeer; later, in 1810, he had abandoned this profession, to serve as
      guide to a Russian engineer, who was charged with an exploring expedition
      to the Polar regions. He afterwards followed him to St. Petersburg, and
      there, after some vicissitudes of fortune, Morok became one of the
      imperial couriers&mdash;these iron automata, that the least caprice of the
      despot hurls in a frail sledge through the immensity of the empire, from
      Persia to the Frozen Sea. For these men, who travel night and day, with
      the rapidity of lightning there are neither seasons nor obstacles,
      fatigues nor danger; living projectiles, they must either be broken to
      pieces, or reach the intended mark. One may conceive the boldness, the
      vigor, and the resignation, of men accustomed to such a life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless to relate here, by what series of singular circumstances
      Morok was induced to exchange his rough pursuit for another profession,
      and at last to enter, as catechumen, a religious house at Friburg; after
      which, being duly and properly converted, he began his nomadic excursions,
      with his menagerie of unknown origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok continued to walk up and down the loft. Night had come. The three
      persons whose arrival he so impatiently expected had not yet made their
      appearance. His walk became more and more nervous and irregular.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sudden he stopped abruptly; leaned his head towards the window; and
      listened. His ear was quick as a savage&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are here!&rdquo; he exclaimed and his fox like eye shone with
      diabolic joy. He had caught the sound of footsteps&mdash;a man&rsquo;s and
      a horse&rsquo;s. Hastening to the window-shutter of the loft, he opened it
      cautiously, and saw the two young girls on horseback, and the old soldier
      who served them as a guide, enter the inn-yard together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had set in, dark and cloudy; a high wind made the lights flicker
      in the lanterns which were used to receive the new guests. But the
      description given to Morok had been so exact, that it was impossible to
      mistake them. Sure of his prey, he closed the window. Having remained in
      meditation for another quarter of an hour&mdash;for the purpose, no doubt,
      of thoroughly digesting his projects&mdash;he leaned over the aperture,
      from which projected the ladder, and called, &ldquo;Goliath!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master!&rdquo; replied a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am&mdash;just come from the slaughter-house with the meat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps of the ladder creaked as an enormous head appeared on a level
      with the floor. The new-comer, who was more than six feet high, and gifted
      with herculean proportions, had been well-named Goliath. He was hideous.
      His squinting eyes were deep set beneath a low and projecting forehead;
      his reddish hair and beard, thick and coarse as horse-hair, gave his
      features a stamp of bestial ferocity; between his broad jaws, armed with
      teeth which resembled fangs, he held by one corner a piece of raw beef
      weighing ten or twelve pounds, finding it, no doubt, easier to carry in
      that fashion, whilst he used his hands to ascend the ladder, which bent
      beneath his weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the whole of this tall and huge body issued from the aperture.
      Judging by his bull-neck, the astonishing breadth of his chest and
      shoulders, and the vast bulk of his arms and legs, this giant need not
      have feared to wrestle single-handed with a bear. He wore an old pair of
      blue trousers with red stripes, faced with tanned sheep&rsquo;s-skin, and
      a vest, or rather cuirass, of thick leather, which was here and there
      slashed by the sharp claws of the animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was fairly on the floor, Goliath unclasped his fangs, opened his
      mouth, and let fall the great piece of beef, licking his blood-stained
      lips with greediness. Like many other mountebanks, this species of monster
      had began by eating raw meat at the fairs for the amusement of the public.
      Thence having gradually acquired a taste for this barbarous food, and
      uniting pleasure with profit, he engaged himself to perform the prelude to
      the exercises of Morok, by devouring, in the presence of the crowd,
      several pounds of raw flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My share and Death&rsquo;s are below stairs, and here are those of
      Cain and Judas,&rdquo; said Goliath, pointing to the chunk of beef.
      &ldquo;Where is the cleaver, that I may cut it in two?&mdash;No preference
      here&mdash;beast or man&mdash;every gullet must have it&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, rolling up one of the sleeves of his vest, he exhibited a fore-arm
      hairy as skin of a wolf, and knotted with veins as large as one&rsquo;s
      thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, master, where&rsquo;s the cleaver?&rdquo;&mdash;He again
      began, as he cast round his eyes in search of that instrument. But instead
      of replying to this inquiry, the Prophet put many questions to his
      disciple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you below when just now some new travellers arrived at the
      inn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master; I was coming from the slaughter-house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are these travellers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two young lasses mounted on a white horse, and an old fellow with a
      big moustache. But the cleaver?&mdash;my beasts are hungry and so am I&mdash;the
      cleaver!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where they have lodged these travellers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The host took them to the far end of the court-yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The building, which overlooks the fields?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master&mdash;but the cleaver&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst of frightful roaring shook the loft, and interrupted Goliath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark to them!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;hunger has driven the
      beasts wild. If I could roar, I should do as they do. I have never seen
      Judas and Cain as they are to-night; they leap in their cages as if they&rsquo;d
      knock all to pieces. As for Death, her eyes shine more than usual like
      candles&mdash;poor Death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So these girls are lodged in the building at the end of the
      court-yard,&rdquo; resumed Morok, without attending to the observations of
      Goliath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;but in the devil&rsquo;s name, where is the cleaver?
      Since Karl went away I have to do all the work, and that makes our meals
      very late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the old man remain with the young girls?&rdquo; asked Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goliath, amazed that, notwithstanding his importunities, his master should
      still appear to neglect the animals&rsquo; supper, regarded the Prophet
      with an increase of stupid astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer, you brute!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am a brute, I have a brute&rsquo;s strength,&rdquo; said
      Goliath, in a surly tone, &ldquo;and brute against brute, I have not
      always come the worst off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask if the old man remained with the girls,&rdquo; repeated
      Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;no!&rdquo; returned the giant. &ldquo;The old man,
      after leading his horse to the stable, asked for a tub and some water,
      took his stand under the porch&mdash;and there&mdash;by the light of a
      lantern&mdash;he is washing out clothes. A man with a gray moustache!&mdash;paddling
      in soap-suds like a washerwoman&mdash;it&rsquo;s as if I were to feed
      canaries!&rdquo; added Goliath, shrugging his shoulders with disdain.
      &ldquo;But now I&rsquo;ve answered you, master, let me attend to the
      beasts&rsquo; supper,&rdquo;&mdash;and, looking round for something, he
      added, &ldquo;where is the cleaver?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of thoughtful silence, the Prophet said to Goliath, &ldquo;You
      will give no food to the beasts this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the giant could not understand these words, the idea was so
      incomprehensible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your pleasure, master?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to give any food to the beasts this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goliath did not answer, but he opened wide his squinting eyes, folded his
      hands, and drew back a couple of steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dost hear me?&rdquo; said Morok, with impatience. &ldquo;Is
      it plain enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not feed? when our meat is there, and supper is already three hours
      after time!&rdquo; cried Goliath, with ever-increasing amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey, and hold your tongue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must wish something bad to happen this evening. Hunger makes
      the beasts furious&mdash;and me also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll drive &lsquo;em mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, so much the better?&mdash;But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, devil take me, I am as hungry as the beasts!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat then&mdash;who prevents it? Your supper is ready, as you devour
      it raw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never eat without my beasts, nor they without me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you again, that, if you dare give any food to the beasts&mdash;I
      will turn you away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goliath uttered a low growl as hoarse as a bear&rsquo;s, and looked at the
      Prophet with a mixture of anger and stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok, having given his orders, walked up and down the loft, appearing to
      reflect. Then, addressing himself to Goliath, who was still plunged in
      deep perplexity, he said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the burgomaster&rsquo;s, where I went to get my
      passport signed?&mdash;To-day his wife bought some books and a chaplet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the giant shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and ask his servant if I may be sure to find the burgomaster
      early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may, perhaps, have something important to communicate; at all
      events, say that I beg him not to leave home without seeing me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! but may I feed the beasts before I go to the burgomaster&rsquo;s?&mdash;only
      the panther, who is most hungry? Come, master; only poor Death? just a
      little morsel to satisfy her; Cain and I and Judas can wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the panther, above all, that I forbid you to feed. Yes, her,
      above all the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the horns of the devil!&rdquo; cried Goliath, &ldquo;what is the
      matter with you to-day? I can make nothing of it. It is a pity that Karl&rsquo;s
      not here; he, being cunning, would help me to understand why you prevent
      the beasts from eating when they are hungry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no need to understand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not Karl soon come back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has already come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be going on here? There is something in the wind. Karl
      goes, and returns, and goes again, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not talking of Karl, but of you; though hungry as a wolf you
      are cunning as a fox, and, when it suits you, as cunning as Karl.&rdquo;
      And, changing on the sudden his tone and manner, Morok slapped the giant
      cordially on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! am I cunning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proof is, that there are ten florins to earn to-night&mdash;and
      you will be keen enough to earn them, I am sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, on those terms, yes&mdash;I am awake,&rdquo; said the giant,
      smiling with a stupid, self-satisfied air. &ldquo;What must I do for ten
      florins?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it hard work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see. Begin by going to the burgomaster&rsquo;s&mdash;but
      first light the fire in that stove.&rdquo; He pointed to it with his
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; said Goliath, somewhat consoled for the delay
      of his supper by the hope of gaining ten florins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that iron bar in the stove,&rdquo; added the Prophet, &ldquo;to
      make it red-hot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave it there; go to the burgomaster&rsquo;s, and return
      here to wait for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will keep the fire up in the stove.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok took a step away, but recollecting himself, he resumed: &ldquo;You
      say the old man is busy washing under the porch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget nothing: the iron bar in the fire&mdash;the burgomaster&mdash;and
      return here to wait my orders.&rdquo; So saying, Morok descended by the
      trap-door and disappeared.

      CHAPTER IV. MOROK and DAGOBERT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>oliath had not
      been mistaken, for Dagobert was washing with that imperturbable gravity
      with which he did everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we remember the habits of a soldier a-field, we need not be
      astonished at this apparent eccentricity. Dagobert only thought of sparing
      the scanty purse of the orphans, and of saving them all care and trouble;
      so every evening when they came to a halt he devoted himself to all sorts
      of feminine occupations. But he was not now serving his apprenticeship in
      these matters; many times, during his campaigns, he had industriously
      repaired the damage and disorder which a day of battle always brings to
      the garments of the soldier; for it is not enough to receive a sabre-cut&mdash;the
      soldier has also to mend his uniform; for the stroke which grazes the skin
      makes likewise a corresponding fissure in the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in the evening or on the morrow of a hard-fought engagement,
      you will see the best soldiers (always distinguished by their fine
      military appearance) take from their cartridge-box or knapsack a
      housewife, furnished with needles, thread, scissors, buttons, and other
      such gear, and apply themselves to all kinds of mending and darning, with
      a zeal that the most industrious workwoman might envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not find a better opportunity to explain the name of Dagobert,
      given to Francis Baudoin (the guide of the orphans) at a time when he was
      considered one of the handsomest and bravest horse-grenadiers of the
      Imperial Guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been fighting hard all day, without any decisive advantage. In
      the evening, the company to which our hero belonged was sent as outliers
      to occupy the ruins of a deserted village. Videttes being posted, half the
      troopers remained in saddle, whilst the others, having picketed their
      horses, were able to take a little rest. Our hero had charged valiantly
      that day without receiving any wound&mdash;for he counted as a mere
      memento the deep scratch on his thigh, which a kaiserlitz had inflicted in
      awkwardly attempting an upward thrust with the bayonet.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10049m.jpg" alt="10049m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10049.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You donkey! my new breeches!&rdquo; the grenadier had exclaimed,
      when he saw the wide yawning rent, which he instantly avenged by running
      the Austrian through, with a thrust scientifically administered. For, if
      he showed a stoical indifference on the subject of injury to his skin, it
      was not so with regard to the ripping up of his best parade uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      He undertook, therefore, the same evening, at the bivouac, to repair this
      accident. Selecting his best needle and thread from the stores of his
      housewife, and arming his finger with a thimble, he began to play the
      tailor by the light of the watch-fire, having first drawn off his
      cavalry-boots, and also (if it must be confessed) the injured garment
      itself, which he turned the wrong side out the better to conceal the
      stitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      This partial undress was certainly a breach of discipline: but the
      captain, as he went his round, could not forbear laughing at the sight of
      the veteran soldier, who, gravely seated, in a squatting position, with
      his grenadier cap on, his regimental coat on his back, his boots by his
      side, and his galligaskins in his lap, was sewing with all the coolness of
      a tailor upon his own shop-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a musket-shot is heard, and the videttes fall back upon the
      detachment, calling to arms. &ldquo;To horse!&rdquo; cries the captain, in
      a voice of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment, the troopers are in their saddles, the unfortunate clothes
      mender having to lead the first rank; there is no time to turn the unlucky
      garment, so he slips it on, as well as he can, wrong side out, and leaps
      upon his horse, without even stopping to put on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      A party of Cossacks, profiting by the cover of a neighboring wood, had
      attempted to surprise the detachment: the fight was bloody, and our hero
      foamed with rage, for he set much value on his equipments, and the day had
      been fatal to him. Thinking of his torn clothes and lost boots, he hacked
      away with more fury than ever; a bright moon illumined the scene of
      action, and his comrades were able to appreciate the brilliant valor of
      our grenadier, who killed two Cossacks, and took an officer prisoner, with
      his own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this skirmish, in which the detachment had maintained its position,
      the captain drew up his men to compliment them on their success, and
      ordered the clothes-mender to advance from the ranks, that he might thank
      him publicly for his gallant behavior. Our hero could have dispensed with
      this ovation, but he was not the less obliged to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge of the surprise of both captain and troopers, when they saw this
      tall and stern-looking figure ride forward at a slow pace, with his naked
      feet in the stirrups, and naked legs pressing the sides of his charger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain drew near in astonishment; but recalling the occupation of the
      soldier at the moment when the alarm was given, he understood the whole
      mystery. &ldquo;Ha, my old comrade!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;thou art
      like King Dagobert&mdash;wearing thy breeches inside out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of discipline, this joke of the captain&rsquo;s was received with
      peals of ill-repressed laughter. But our friend, sitting upright in his
      saddle, with his left thumb pressing the well adjusted reins, and his
      sword-hilt carried close to his right thigh, made a half-wheel, and
      returned to his place in the ranks without changing countenance, after he
      had duly received the congratulations of his captain. From that day,
      Francis Baudoin received and kept the nickname of Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Dagobert was under the porch of the inn, occupied in washing, to the
      great amazement of sundry beer-drinkers, who observed him with curious
      eyes from the large common room in which they were assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, it was a curious spectacle. Dagobert had laid aside his gray
      top-coat, and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt; with a vigorous hand,
      and good supply of soap, he was rubbing away at a wet handkerchief, spread
      out on the board, the end of which rested in a tub full of water. Upon his
      right arm, tattooed with warlike emblems in red and blue colors, two
      scars, deep enough to admit the finger, were distinctly visible. No wonder
      then, that, while smoking their pipes, and emptying their pots of beer,
      the Germans should display some surprise at the singular occupation of
      this tall, moustached, bald-headed old man, with the forbidding
      countenance&mdash;for the features of Dagobert assumed a harsh and grim
      expression, when he was no longer in presence of the two girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sustained attention, of which he saw himself the object, began to put
      him out of patience, for his employment appeared to him quite natural. At
      this moment, the Prophet entered the porch, and, perceiving the soldier,
      eyed him attentively for several seconds; then approaching, he said to him
      in French, in a rather sly tone: &ldquo;It would seem, comrade, that you
      have not much confidence in the washerwomen of Mockern?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, without discontinuing his work, half turned his head with a
      frown, looked askant at the Prophet, and made him no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished at this silence, Morok resumed: &ldquo;If I do not deceive
      myself, you are French, my fine fellow. The words on your arm prove it,
      and your military air stamps you as an old soldier of the Empire.
      Therefore I find, that, for a hero, you have taken rather late to wear
      petticoats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert remained mute, but he gnawed his moustache, and plied the soap,
      with which he was rubbing the linen, in a most hurried, not to say angry
      style; for the face and words of the beast-tamer displeased him more than
      he cared to show. Far from being discouraged, the Prophet continued:
      &ldquo;I am sure, my fine fellow, that you are neither deaf nor dumb; why,
      then, will you not answer me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Losing all patience, Dagobert turned abruptly round, looked Morok full in
      the face, and said to him in a rough voice: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you:
      I don&rsquo;t wish to know you! Chain up your curb!&rdquo; And he betook
      himself again to his washing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we may make acquaintance. We can drink a glass of Rhine-wine
      together, and talk of our campaigns. I also have seen some service, I
      assure you; and that, perhaps, will induce you to be more civil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veins on the bald forehead of Dagobert swelled perceptibly; he saw in
      the look and accent of the man, who thus obstinately addressed him,
      something designedly provoking; still he contained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you, why should you not drink a glass of wine with me&mdash;we
      could talk about France. I lived there a long time; it is a fine country;
      and when I meet Frenchmen abroad, I feel sociable&mdash;particularly when
      they know how to use the soap as well as you do. If I had a housewife I&rsquo;d
      send her to your school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sarcastic meaning was no longer disguised; impudence and bravado were
      legible in the Prophet&rsquo;s looks. Thinking that, with such an
      adversary, the dispute might become serious, Dagobert, who wished to avoid
      a quarrel at any price, carried off his tub to the other end of the porch,
      hoping thus to put an end to the scene which was a sore trial of his
      temper. A flash of joy lighted up the tawny eyes of the brute-tamer. The
      white circle, which surrounded the pupil seemed to dilate. He ran his
      crooked fingers two or three times through his yellow beard, in token of
      satisfaction; then he advanced slowly towards the soldier, accompanied by
      several idlers from the common-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his coolness, Dagobert, amazed and incensed at the
      impudent pertinacity of the Prophet, was at first disposed to break the
      washing-board on his head; but, remembering the orphans, he thought better
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding his arms upon his breast, Morok said to him, in a dry and insolent
      tone: &ldquo;It is very certain you are not civil, my man of suds!&rdquo;
      Then, turning to the spectators, he continued in German: &ldquo;I tell
      this Frenchman, with his long moustache, that he is not civil. We shall
      see what answer he&rsquo;ll make. Perhaps it will be necessary to give him
      a lesson. Heaven preserve me from quarrels!&rdquo; he added, with mock
      compunction; &ldquo;but the Lord has enlightened me&mdash;I am his
      creature, and I ought to make his work respected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystical effrontery of this peroration was quite to the taste of the
      idlers; the fame of the Prophet had reached Mockern, and, as a performance
      was expected on the morrow, this prelude much amused the company. On
      hearing the insults of his adversary, Dagobert could not help saying in
      the German language: &ldquo;I know German. Speak in German&mdash;the rest
      will understand you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      New spectators now arrived, and joined the first comers; the adventure had
      become exciting, and a ring was formed around the two persons most
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet resumed in German: &ldquo;I said that you were not civil, and
      I now say you are grossly rude. What do you answer to that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Dagobert, coldly, as he proceeded to rinse out
      another piece of linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; returned Morok; &ldquo;that is very little. I will
      be less brief, and tell you, that, when an honest man offers a glass of
      wine civilly to a stranger, that stranger has no right to answer with
      insolence, and deserves to be taught manners if he does so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Great drops of sweat ran down Dagobert&rsquo;s forehead and cheeks; his
      large imperial was incessantly agitated by nervous trembling&mdash;but he
      restrained himself. Taking, by two of the corners, the handkerchief which
      he had just dipped in the water, he shook it, wrung it, and began to hum
      to himself the burden of the old camp ditty:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Out of Tirlemont&rsquo;s flea-haunted den,
     We ride forth next day of the sen,
     With sabre in hand, ah!
     Good-bye to Amanda,&rdquo; etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      The silence to which Dagobert had condemned himself, almost choked him;
      this song afforded him some relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok, turning towards the spectators, said to them, with an air of
      hypocritical restraint: &ldquo;We knew that the soldiers of Napoleon were
      pagans, who stabled their horses in churches, and offended the Lord a
      hundred times a day, and who, for their sins, were justly drowned in the
      Beresino, like so many Pharaohs; but we did not know that the Lord, to
      punish these miscreants, had deprived them of courage&mdash;their single
      gift. Here is a man, who has insulted, in me, a creature favored by divine
      grace, and who affects not to understand that I require an apology; or
      else&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Dagobert, without looking at the Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you must give me satisfaction!&mdash;I have already told you
      that I have seen service. We shall easily find somewhere a couple of
      swords, and to morrow morning, at peep of day, we can meet behind a wall,
      and show the color of our blood&mdash;that is, if you have any in your
      veins!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This challenge began to frighten the spectators, who were not prepared for
      so tragical a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, fight?&mdash;a very, fine idea!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;To
      get yourself both locked up in prison: the laws against duelling are
      strict.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly with relation to strangers or nondescripts,&rdquo;
      added another. &ldquo;If they were to find you with arms in your hands,
      the burgomaster would shut you up in jail, and keep you there two or three
      months before trial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be so mean as to denounce us?&rdquo; asked Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; cried several; &ldquo;do as you like. We
      are only giving you a friendly piece of advice, by which you may profit,
      if you think fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What care I for prison?&rdquo; exclaimed the Prophet. &ldquo;Only
      give me a couple of swords, and you shall see to-morrow morning if I heed
      what the burgomaster can do or say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do with two swords?&rdquo; asked Dagobert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have one in your grasp, and I one in mine, you&rsquo;d
      see. The Lord commands us to have a care of his honor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert shrugged his shoulders, made a bundle of his linen in his
      handkerchief, dried his soap, and put it carefully into a little oil-silk
      bag&mdash;then, whistling his favorite air of Tirlemont, moved to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet frowned; he began to fear that his challenge would not be
      accepted. He advanced a step or so to encounter Dagobert, placed himself
      before him, as if to intercept his passage, and, folding his arms, and
      scanning him from head to foot with bitter insolence, said to him: &ldquo;So!
      an old soldier of that arch-robber, Napoleon, is only fit for a
      washerwoman, and refuses to fight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he refuses to fight,&rdquo; answered Dagobert, in a firm
      voice, but becoming fearfully pale. Never, perhaps, had the soldier given
      to his orphan charge such a proof of tenderness and devotion. For a man of
      his character to let himself be insulted with impunity, and refuse to
      fight&mdash;the sacrifice was immense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are a coward&mdash;you are afraid of me&mdash;and you
      confess it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Dagobert made, as it were, a pull upon himself&mdash;as if
      a sudden thought had restrained him the moment he was about to rush on the
      Prophet. Indeed, he had remembered the two maidens, and the fatal
      hindrance which a duel, whatever might be the result, would occasion to
      their journey. But the impulse of anger, though rapid, had been so
      significant&mdash;the expression of the stern, pale face, bathed in sweat,
      was so daunting, that the Prophet and the spectators drew back a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Profound silence reigned for some seconds, and then, by a sudden reaction,
      Dagobert seemed to have gained the general interest. One of the company
      said to those near him; &ldquo;This man is clearly not a coward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! certainly not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sometimes requires more courage to refuse a challenge than to
      accept one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all the Prophet was wrong to pick a quarrel about nothing&mdash;and
      with a stranger, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for a stranger, if he fought and was taken up, would have a
      good long imprisonment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, you see,&rdquo; added another, &ldquo;he travels with two
      young girls. In such a position, ought a man to fight about trifles? If he
      should be killed or put in prison, what would become of them, poor
      children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert turned towards the person who had pronounced these last words. He
      saw a stout fellow, with a frank and simple countenance; the soldier
      offered him his hand, and said with emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The German shook cordially the hand, which Dagobert had proffered, and,
      holding it still in his own, he added: &ldquo;Do one thing, sir&mdash;share
      a bowl of punch with us. We will make that mischief-making Prophet
      acknowledge that he has been too touchy, and he shall drink to your
      health.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this moment the brute-tamer, enraged at the issue of this scene, for
      he had hoped that the soldier would accept his challenge, looked on with
      savage contempt at those who had thus sided against him. But now his
      features gradually relaxed; and, believing it useful to his projects to
      hide his disappointment, he walked up to the soldier, and said to him,
      with a tolerably good grace: &ldquo;Well, I give way to these gentlemen. I
      own I was wrong. Your frigid air had wounded me, and I was not master of
      myself. I repeat, that I was wrong,&rdquo; he added, with suppressed
      vexation; &ldquo;the Lord commands humility&mdash;and&mdash;I beg your
      pardon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This proof of moderation and regret was highly appreciated and loudly
      applauded by the spectators. &ldquo;He asks your pardon; you cannot expect
      more, my brave fellow?&rdquo; said one of them, addressing Dagobert.
      &ldquo;Come, let us all drink together; we make you this offer frankly&mdash;accept
      it in the same spirit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; accept it, we beg you, in the name of your pretty little
      girls,&rdquo; said the stout man, hoping to decide Dagobert by this
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied he, touched by the hearty
      advances of the Germans; &ldquo;you are very worthy people. But, when one
      is treated, he must offer drink in return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will accept it&mdash;that&rsquo;s understood. Each his
      turn, and all fair. We will pay for the first bowl, you for the second.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poverty is no crime,&rdquo; answered Dagobert; &ldquo;and I must
      tell you honestly that I cannot afford to pay for drink. We have still a
      long journey to go, and I must not incur any useless expenses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier spoke these words with such firm, but simple dignity, that the
      Germans did not venture to renew their offer, feeling that a man of
      Dagobert&rsquo;s character could not accept it without humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so much the worse,&rdquo; said the stout man. &ldquo;I should
      have liked to clink glasses with you. Good-night, my brave trooper!&mdash;Good-night&mdash;for
      it grows late, and mine host of the Falcon will soon turn us out of doors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Dagobert, as he directed his
      steps towards the stable, to give his horse a second allowance of
      provender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok approached him, and said in a voice even more humble than before:
      &ldquo;I have acknowledged my error, and asked your pardon. You have not
      answered me; do you still bear malice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I meet you,&rdquo; said the veteran, in a suppressed and
      hollow tone, &ldquo;when my children have no longer need of me, I will
      just say two words to you, and they will not be long ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned his back abruptly on the Prophet, who walked slowly out of
      the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inn of the White Falcon formed a parallelogram. At one end rose the
      principal dwelling; at the other was a range of buildings, which contained
      sundry chambers, let at a low price to the poorer sort of travellers; a
      vaulted passage opened a way through this latter into the country;
      finally, on either side of the court-yard were sheds and stables, with
      lofts and garrets erected over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, entering one of these stables, took from off a chest the portion
      of oats destined for his horse, and, pouring it into a winnowing basket,
      shook it as he approached Jovial.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great astonishment, his old travelling companion did not respond
      with a joyous neigh to the rustle of the oats rattling on the wicker work.
      Alarmed, he called Jovial with a friendly voice; but the animal, instead
      of turning towards his master a look of intelligence, and impatiently
      striking the ground with his fore-feet, remained perfectly motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more surprised, the soldier went up to him. By the dubious light
      of a stable-lantern, he saw the poor animal in an attitude which implied
      terror&mdash;his legs half bent, his head stretched forward, his ears
      down, his nostrils quivering; he had drawn tight his halter, as if he
      wished to break it, in order to get away from the partition that supported
      his rack and manger; abundant cold-sweat had speckled his hide with bluish
      stains, and his coat altogether looked dull and bristling, instead of
      standing out sleek and glossy from the dark background of the stable;
      lastly, from time to time, his body shook with convulsive starts.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10057m.jpg" alt="10057m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10057.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, old Jovial!&rdquo; said the soldier, as he put down the
      basket, in order to soothe his horse with more freedom, &ldquo;you are
      like thy master&mdash;afraid!&mdash;Yes,&rdquo; he added with bitterness,
      as he thought of the offence he had himself endured, &ldquo;you are afraid&mdash;though
      no coward in general.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the caresses and the voice of his master, the horse
      continued to give signs of terror; he pulled somewhat less violently at
      his halter, and approaching his nostrils to the hand of Dagobert, sniffed
      audibly, as if he doubted it were he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo; cried Dagobert. &ldquo;Something
      extraordinary must be passing here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier looked around him with uneasiness. It was a large stable,
      faintly lighted by the lantern suspended from the roof, which was covered
      with innumerable cobwebs; at the further end, separated from Jovial by
      some stalls with bars between, were the three strong, black, horses of the
      brute-tamer&mdash;as tranquil as Jovial was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, struck with this singular contrast, of which he was soon to have
      the explanation, again caressed his horse; and the animal, gradually
      reassured by his master&rsquo;s presence, licked his hands, rubbed his
      head against him, uttered a low neigh, and gave him his usual tokens of
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, this is how I like to see my old Jovial!&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, as he took up the winnowing-basket, and poured its contents into
      the manger. &ldquo;Now eat with a good appetite, for we have a long day&rsquo;s
      march tomorrow; and, above all, no more of these foolish fears about
      nothing! If thy comrade, Spoil-sport, was here, he would keep you in
      heart; but he is along with the children, and takes care of them in my
      absence. Come, eat! Instead of staring at me in that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the horse, having just touched the oats with his mouth, as if in
      obedience to his master, returned to them no more, and began to nibble at
      the sleeve of Dagobert&rsquo;s coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my poor Jovial! there is something the matter with you.
      You have generally such a good appetite, and now you leave your corn.
      &lsquo;Tis the first time this has happened since our departure,&rdquo;
      said the soldier, who was now growing seriously uneasy, for the issue of
      his journey greatly depended on the health and vigor of his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a frightful roaring, so near that it seemed to come from the
      stable in which they were, gave so violent a shock to Jovial, that with
      one effort he broke his halter, leaped over the bar that marked his place,
      and rushing at the open door, escaped into the court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert had himself started at the suddenness of this wild and fearful
      sound, which at once explained to him the cause of his horse&rsquo;s
      terror. The adjoining stable was occupied by the itinerant menagerie of
      the brute-tamer, and was only separated by the partition, which supported
      the mangers. The three horses of the Prophet, accustomed to these
      howlings, had remained perfectly quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the soldier, recovering himself; &ldquo;I
      understand it now. Jovial has heard another such roar before, and he can
      scent the animals of that insolent scoundrel. It is enough to frighten
      him,&rdquo; added he, as he carefully collected the oats from the manger;
      &ldquo;once in another stable, and there must be others in this place, he
      will no longer leave his peck, and we shall be able to start early
      to-morrow morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified horse, after running and galloping about the yard, returned
      at the voice of the soldier, who easily caught him by the broken halter;
      and a hostler, whom Dagobert asked if there was another vacant stable,
      having pointed out one that was only intended for a single animal, Jovial
      was comfortably installed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When delivered from his ferocious neighbors, the horse became tranquil as
      before, and even amused himself much at the expense of Dagobert&rsquo;s
      top coat, which, thanks to his tricks, might have afforded immediate
      occupation for his master&rsquo;s needle, if the latter had not been fully
      engaged in admiring the eagerness with which Jovial dispatched his
      provender. Completely reassured on his account, the soldier shut the door
      of the stable, and proceeded to get his supper as quickly as possible, in
      order to rejoin the orphans, whom he reproached himself with having left
      so long.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. ROSE AND BLANCHE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he orphans
      occupied a dilapidated chamber in one of the most remote wings of the inn,
      with a single window opening upon the country. A bed without curtains, a
      table, and two chairs, composed the more than modest furniture of this
      retreat, which was now lighted by a lamp. On the table, which stood near
      the window, was deposited the knapsack of the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Siberian dog, who was lying close to the door, had already twice
      uttered a deep growl, and turned his head towards the window&mdash;but
      without giving any further affect to this hostile manifestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters, half recumbent in their bed, were clad in long white
      wrappers, buttoned at the neck and wrists. They wore no caps, but their
      beautiful chestnut hair was confined at the temples by a broad piece of
      tape, so that it might not get tangled during the night. These white
      garments, and the white fillet that like a halo encircled their brows,
      gave to their fresh and blooming faces a still more candid expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans laughed and chatted, for, in spite of some early sorrows, they
      still retained the ingenuous gayety of their age. The remembrance of their
      mother would sometimes make them sad, but this sorrow had in it nothing
      bitter; it was rather a sweet melancholy, to be sought instead of shunned.
      For them, this adored mother was not dead&mdash;she was only absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as ignorant as Dagobert, with regard to devotional exercises, for
      in the desert where they had lived there was neither church nor priest,
      their faith, as was already said, consisted in this&mdash;that God, just
      and good, had so much pity for the poor mothers whose children were left
      on earth, that he allowed them to look down upon them from highest heaven&mdash;to
      see them always, to hear them always, and sometimes to send fair guardian
      angels to protect therein. Thanks to this guileless illusion, the orphans,
      persuaded that their mother incessantly watched over them, felt, that to
      do wrong would be to afflict her, and to forfeit the protection of the
      good angels.&mdash;This was the entire theology of Rose and Blanche&mdash;a
      creed sufficient for such pure and loving souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the evening in question, the two sisters chatted together whilst
      waiting for Dagobert. Their theme interested them much, for, since some
      days, they had a secret, a great secret, which often quickened the
      beatings of their innocent hearts, often agitated their budding bosoms,
      changed to bright scarlet the roses on their cheeks, and infused a
      restless and dreamy langour into the soft blue of their large eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, this evening, occupied the edge of the couch, with her rounded arms
      crossed behind her head, which was half turned towards her sister;
      Blanche, with her elbow resting on the bolster, looked at her smilingly,
      and said: &ldquo;Do you think he will come again to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! certainly. He promised us yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so good, he would not break his promise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so handsome, with his long fair curls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his name&mdash;what a charming name!&mdash;How well it suits
      his face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a sweet smile and soft voice, when he says to us, taking
      us by the hand: &lsquo;My children, bless God that he has given you one
      soul. What others seek elsewhere, you will find in yourselves.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Since your two hearts,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;only make
      one.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pleasure to remember his words, sister!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are so attentive! When I see you listening to him, it is as if I
      saw myself, my dear little mirror!&rdquo; said Rose, laughing, and kissing
      her sister&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;Well&mdash;when he speaks, your&mdash;or
      rather our eyes&mdash;are wide, wide open, our lips moving as if we
      repeated every word after him. It is no wonder we forget nothing that he
      says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what he says is so grand, so noble, and generous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my sister, as he goes on talking, what good thoughts rise
      within us! If we could but always keep them in mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be afraid! they will remain in our hearts, like little birds
      in their mother&rsquo;s nests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how lucky it is, Rose, that he loves us both at the same time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not do otherwise, since we have but one heart between us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could he love Rose, without loving Blanche?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would have become of the poor, neglected one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then again he would have found it so difficult to choose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are so much like one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, to save himself that trouble,&rdquo; said Rose, laughing,
      &ldquo;he has chosen us both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it not the best way? He is alone to love us; we are two
      together to think of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only he must not leave us till we reach Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in Paris, too&mdash;we must see him there also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, above all at Paris; it will be good to have him with us&mdash;and
      Dagobert, too&mdash;in that great city. Only think, Blanche, how beautiful
      it must be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris!&mdash;it must be like a city all of gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A city, where every one must be happy, since it is so beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ought we, poor orphans, dare so much as to enter it? How people
      will look at us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but every one there is happy, every one must be good
      also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will love us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, besides, we shall be with our friend with the fair hair and
      blue eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has yet told us nothing of Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not thought of it; we must speak to him about it this very
      night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is in the mood for talking. Often you know, he likes best to
      gaze on us in silence&mdash;his eyes on our eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. In those moments, his look recalls to me the gaze of our dear
      mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, as she sees it all, how pleased she must be at what has
      happened to us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, when we are so much beloved, we must, I hope, deserve it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what a vain thing it is!&rdquo; said Blanche, smoothing with
      her slender fingers the parting of the hair on her sister&rsquo;s
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Rose said to her: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you think we should relate all this to Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think so, let us do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We tell him everything, as we told everything to mother. Why should
      we conceal this from him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially as it is something which gives us so much pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not find that, since we have known our friend, our hearts
      beat quicker and stronger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they seem to be more full.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason why is plain enough; our friend fills up a good space in
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will do best to tell Dagobert what a lucky star ours is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right&mdash;&rdquo; At this moment the dog gave another
      deep growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Rose, as she pressed closer to Blanche, &ldquo;there
      is the dog growling again. What can be the matter with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoil-sport, do not growl! Come hither,&rdquo; said Blanche,
      striking with her little hand on the side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog rose, again growled deeply, and came to lay his great, intelligent
      looking head on the counterpane, still obstinately casting a sidelong
      glance at the window; the sisters bent over him to pat his broad forehead,
      in the centre of which was a remarkable bump, the certain sign of extreme
      purity of race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you growl so, Spoil-sport?&rdquo; said Blanche, pulling
      him gently by the ears&mdash;&ldquo;eh, my good dog?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beast! he is always so uneasy when Dagobert is away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; one would think he knows that he then has a double
      charge over us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, it seems to me, Dagobert is late in coming to say
      good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he is attending to Jovial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me think that we did not bid good-night to dear old
      Jovial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor beast! he seems so glad when he licks our hands. One would
      think that he thanked us for our visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily, Dagobert will have wished him good-night for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Dagobert! he is always thinking of us. How he spoils us! We
      remain idle, and he has all the trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we prevent it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity that we are not rich, to give him a little rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We rich! Alas, my sister! we shall never be anything but poor
      orphans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s the medal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, there is some hope attached to it, else we should not
      have made this long journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert has promised to tell us all, this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was prevented from continuing, for two of the windowpanes flew to
      pieces with a loud crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans, with a cry of terror, threw themselves into each other&rsquo;s
      arms, whilst the dog rushed towards the window, barking furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale, trembling, motionless with affright, clasping each other in a close
      embrace, the two sisters held their breath; in their extreme fear, they
      durst not even cast their eyes in the direction of the window. The dog,
      with his forepaws resting on the sill, continued to bark with violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! what can it be?&rdquo; murmured the orphans. &ldquo;And
      Dagobert not here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Rose, suddenly seizing Blanche by the arm;
      &ldquo;hark!&mdash;some one coming up the stairs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven! it does not sound like the tread of Dagobert. Do you
      not hear what heavy footsteps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! come, Spoil-sport, and defend us!&rdquo; cried the two
      sisters at once, in an agony of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boards of the wooden staircase really creaked beneath the weight of
      unusually heavy footsteps, and a singular kind of rustling was heard along
      the thin partition that divided the chamber from the landing-place. Then a
      ponderous mass, falling against the door of the room, shook it violently;
      and the girls, at the very height of terror, looked at each other without
      the power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. It was Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of him Rose and Blanche joyfully exchanged a kiss, as if they
      had just escaped from a great danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter? why are you afraid?&rdquo; asked the soldier in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you only knew!&rdquo; said Rose, panting as she spoke, for
      both her own heart and her sister&rsquo;s beat with violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew what has just happened! We did not recognize your
      footsteps&mdash;they seemed so heavy&mdash;and then that noise behind the
      partition!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little frightened doves that you are! I could not run up the stairs
      like a boy of fifteen, seeing that I carried my bed upon my back&mdash;a
      straw mattress that I have just flung down before your door, to sleep
      there as usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! how foolish we must be, sister, not to have thought of
      that!&rdquo; said Rose, looking at Blanche. And their pretty faces, which
      had together grown pale, together resumed their natural color.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this scene the dog, still resting against the window, did not cease
      barking a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes Spoil-sport bark in that direction, my children?&rdquo;
      said the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know. Two of our windowpanes have just been broken. That
      is what first frightened us so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering a word Dagobert flew to the window, opened it quickly,
      pushed back the shutter, and leaned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw nothing; it was a dark night. He listened; but heard only the
      moaning of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoil-sport,&rdquo; said he to his dog, pointing to the open
      window, &ldquo;leap out, old fellow, and search!&rdquo; The faithful
      animal took one mighty spring and disappeared by the window, raised only
      about eight feet above the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, still leaning over, encouraged his dog with voice and gesture:
      &ldquo;Search, old fellow, search! If there is any one there, pin him&mdash;your
      fangs are strong&mdash;and hold him fast till I come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10065m.jpg" alt="10065m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10065.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      But Spoil-sport found no one. They heard him go backwards and forwards,
      snuffing on every side, and now and then uttering a low cry like a hound
      at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one, my good dog, that&rsquo;s clear, or you would have
      had him by the throat ere this.&rdquo; Then, turning to the maidens, who
      listened to his words and watched his movements with uneasiness: &ldquo;My
      girls,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how were these panes broken? Did you not
      remark?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dagobert; we were talking together when we heard a great crash,
      and then the glass fell into the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to me,&rdquo; added Rose, &ldquo;as if a shutter had
      struck suddenly against the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert examined the shutter, and observed a long movable hook, designed
      to fasten it on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It blows hard,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the wind must have swung
      round the shutter, and this hook broke the window. Yes, yes; that is it.
      What interest could anybody have to play such a sorry trick?&rdquo; Then,
      speaking to Spoil sport, he asked, &ldquo;Well, my good fellow, is there
      no one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog answered by a bark, which the soldier no doubt understood as a
      negative, for he continued: &ldquo;Well, then, come back! Make the round&mdash;you
      will find some door open&mdash;you are never at a loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal followed this advice. After growling for a few seconds beneath
      the window, he set off at a gallop to make the circuit of the buildings,
      and come back by the court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite easy, my children!&rdquo; said the soldier, as he again
      drew near the orphans; &ldquo;it was only the wind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were a good deal frightened,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you. But now I think of it, this draught is likely to
      give you cold.&rdquo; And seeking to remedy this inconvenience, he took
      from a chair the reindeer pelisse, and suspended it from the spring-catch
      of the curtainless window, using the skirts to stop up as closely as
      possible the two openings made by the breaking of the panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Dagobert, how good you are! We were very uneasy at not
      seeing you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were absent longer than usual. But what is the matter with
      you?&rdquo; added Rose, only just then perceiving that his countenance was
      disturbed and pallid, for he was still under the painful influence of the
      brawl with Morok; &ldquo;how pale you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, my pets?&mdash;Oh, nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I assure you, your countenance is quite changed. Rose is
      right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you there is nothing the matter,&rdquo; answered the
      soldier, not without some embarrassment, for he was little used to
      deceive; till, finding an excellent excuse for his emotion, he added:
      &ldquo;If I do look at all uncomfortable, it is your fright that has made
      me so, for indeed it was my fault.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your fault!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for if I had not lost so much time at supper, I should have
      been here when the window was broken, and have spared you the fright.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, you are here now, and we think no more of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, my children, for we have to talk together,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, as he drew a chair close to the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me, are you quite awake?&rdquo; he added, trying to smile
      in order to reassure them. &ldquo;Are those large eyes properly open?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Dagobert!&rdquo; cried the two girls, smiling in their turn,
      and opening their blue eyes to the utmost extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;they are yet far
      enough, from shutting; besides, it is only nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We also have something to tell, Dagobert,&rdquo; resumed Rose,
      after exchanging glances with her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, and a very great secret!&rdquo; added Rose, quite seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret which concerns us both,&rdquo; resumed Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! I should think so. What concerns the one always concerns the
      other. Are you not always, as the saying goes, &lsquo;two faces under one
      hood?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, how can it be otherwise, when you put our heads under the
      great hood of your pelisse?&rdquo; said Rose, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they are again, mocking-birds! One never has the last word
      with them. Come, ladies, your secret, since a secret there is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, sister,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss, it is for you to speak. You are to-day on duty, as
      eldest, and such an important thing as telling a secret like that you talk
      of belongs of right to the elder sister. Come, I am listening to you,&rdquo;
      added the soldier, as he forced a smile, the better to conceal from the
      maidens how much he still felt the unpunished affronts of the brute tamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Rose (who, as Dagobert said, was doing duty as eldest) that spoke
      for herself and for her sister.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE SECRET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, good Dagobert,&rdquo; said Rose, in a gracefully
      caressing manner, &ldquo;as we are going to tell our secret&mdash;you must
      promise not to scold us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not scold your darlings, will you?&rdquo; added Blanche,
      in a no less coaxing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted!&rdquo; replied Dagobert gravely; &ldquo;particularly as I
      should not well know how to set about it&mdash;but why should I scold you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we ought perhaps to have told you sooner what we are going
      to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my children,&rdquo; said Dagobert sententiously, after
      reflecting a moment on this case of conscience; &ldquo;one of two things
      must be. Either you were right, or else you were wrong, to hide this from
      me. If you were right, very well; if you were wrong, it is done: so let&rsquo;s
      say no more about it. Go on&mdash;I am all attention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely reassured by this luminous decision, Rose resumed, while she
      exchanged a smile with her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only think, Dagobert; for two successive nights we have had a
      visitor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A visitor!&rdquo; cried the soldier, drawing himself up suddenly in
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a charming visitor&mdash;he is so very fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair&mdash;the devil!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fair&mdash;and with blue eyes,&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue eyes&mdash;blue devils!&rdquo; and Dagobert again bounded on
      his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, blue eyes&mdash;as long as that,&rdquo; resumed Rose, placing
      the tip of one forefinger about the middle of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds! they might be as long as that,&rdquo; said the veteran,
      indicating the whole length of his term from the elbow, &ldquo;they might
      be as long as that, and it would have nothing to do with it. Fair, and
      with blue eyes. Pray what may this mean, young ladies?&rdquo; and Dagobert
      rose from his seat with a severe and painfully unquiet look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, Dagobert, you have begun to scold us already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just at the very commencement,&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commencement!&mdash;what, is there to be a sequel? a finish?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A finish? we hope not,&rdquo; said Rose, laughing like mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All we ask is, that it should last forever,&rdquo; added Blanche,
      sharing in the hilarity of her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert looked gravely from one to the other of the two maidens, as if
      trying to guess this enigma; but when he saw their sweet, innocent faces
      gracefully animated by a frank, ingenuous laugh, he reflected that they
      would not be so gay if they had any serious matter for self-reproach, and
      he felt pleased at seeing them so merry in the midst of their precarious
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh on, my children!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like so much to see
      you laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, thinking that was not precisely the way in which he ought to treat
      the singular confession of the young girls, he added in a gruff voice:
      &ldquo;Yes, I like to see you laugh&mdash;but not when you receive fair
      visitors with blue eyes, young ladies!&mdash;Come, acknowledge that I&rsquo;m
      an old fool to listen to such nonsense&mdash;you are only making game of
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, what we tell you is quite true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we never tell stories,&rdquo; added Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are right&mdash;they never fib,&rdquo; said the soldier, in
      renewed perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how the devil is such a visit possible? I sleep before your
      door&mdash;Spoil-sport sleeps under your window&mdash;and all the blue
      eyes and fair locks in the world must come in by one of those two ways&mdash;and,
      if they had tried it, the dog and I, who have both of us quick ears, would
      have received their visits after our fashion. But come, children! pray,
      speak to the purpose. Explain yourselves!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters, who saw, by the expression of Dagobert&rsquo;s
      countenance, that he felt really uneasy, determined no longer to trifle
      with his kindness. They exchanged a glance, and Rose, taking in her little
      hand the coarse, broad palm of the veteran, said to him: &ldquo;Come, do
      not plague yourself! We will tell you all about the visits of our friend,
      Gabriel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are again!&mdash;He has a name, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, he has a name. It is Gabriel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not a pretty name, Dagobert? Oh, you will see and love, as we
      do, our beautiful Gabriel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll love your beautiful Gabriel, will I?&rdquo; said the
      veteran, shaking his head&mdash;&ldquo;Love your beautiful Gabriel?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      as it may be. I must first know&mdash;&rdquo; Then, interrupting himself,
      he added: &ldquo;It is queer. That reminds me of something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen years ago, in the last letter that your father, on his
      return from France, brought me from my wife: she told me that, poor as she
      was, and with our little growing Agricola on her hands, she had taken in a
      poor deserted child, with the face of a cherub, and the name of Gabriel&mdash;and
      only a short time since I heard of him again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from whom, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know that by and by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;since you have a Gabriel of your own&mdash;there
      is the more reason that you should love ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours! but who is yours? I am on thorns till you tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Dagobert,&rdquo; resumed Rose, &ldquo;that Blanche and I
      are accustomed to fall asleep, holding each other by the hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I have often seen you in your cradle. I was never tired
      of looking at you; it was so pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;two nights ago, we had just fallen asleep, when we
      beheld&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was in a dream!&rdquo; cried Dagobert. &ldquo;Since you were
      asleep, it was in a dream!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, in a dream&mdash;how else would you have it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray let my sister go on with her tale!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All, well and good!&rdquo; said the soldier with a sigh of
      satisfaction; &ldquo;well and good! To be sure, I was tranquil enough in
      any case&mdash;because&mdash;but still&mdash;I like it better to be a
      dream. Continue, my little Rose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once asleep, we both dreamt the same thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! both the same?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dagobert; for the next morning when we awoke we related our
      two dreams to each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they were exactly alike.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd enough, my children; and what was this dream all
      about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our dream, Blanche and I were seated together, when we saw enter
      a beautiful angel, with a long white robe, fair locks, blue eyes, and so
      handsome and benign a countenance, that we elapsed our hands as if to pray
      to him. Then he told us, in a soft voice, that he was called Gabriel; that
      our mother had sent him to be our guardian angel, and that he would never
      abandon us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, then,&rdquo; added Blanche, &ldquo;he took us each by the
      hand, and, bending his fair face over us, looked at us for a long time in
      silence, with so much goodness&mdash;with so much goodness, that we could
      not withdraw our eyes from his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Rose, &ldquo;and his look seemed, by turns, to
      attract us, or to go to our hearts. At length, to our great sorrow,
      Gabriel quitted us, having told us that we should see him again the
      following night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he make his appearance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Judge with what impatience we waited the moment of
      sleep, to see if our friend would return, and visit us in our slumbers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Dagobert, scratching his forehead; &ldquo;this
      reminds me, young ladies, that you kept on rubbing your eyes last evening,
      and pretending to be half asleep. I wager, it was all to send me away the
      sooner, and to get to your dream as fast as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason being, you could not say to me, as you would to
      Spoil-sport: Lie down, Dagobert! Well&mdash;so your friend Gabriel came
      back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and this time he talked to us a great deal, and gave us, in
      the name of our mother, such touching, such noble counsels, that the next
      day, Rose and I spent our whole time in recalling every word of our
      guardian angel&mdash;and his face, and his look&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This reminds me again, young ladies, that you were whispering all
      along the road this morning; and that when I spoke of white, you answered
      black.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dagobert, we were thinking of Gabriel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, ever since, we love him as well as he loves us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is only one between both of you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not our mother one between us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Dagobert&mdash;are you not also one for us both?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true! And yet, do you know, I shall finish by being jealous
      of that Gabriel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are our friend by day&mdash;he is our friend by night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s understand it clearly. If you talk of him all day, and
      dream of him all night, what will there remain for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will remain for you your two orphans, whom you love so much,&rdquo;
      said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who have only you left upon earth,&rdquo; added Blanche, in a
      caressing tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! humph! that&rsquo;s right, coax the old man over, Nay,
      believe me, my children,&rdquo; added the soldier, tenderly, &ldquo;I am
      quite satisfied with my lot. I can afford to let you have your Gabriel. I
      felt sure that Spoil sport and myself could take our rest in quiet. After
      all, there is nothing so astonishing in what you tell me; your first dream
      struck your fancy, and you talked so much about it that you had a second;
      nor should I be surprised if you were to see this fine fellow a third
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dagobert! do not make a jest of it! They are only dreams, but
      we think our mother sends them to us. Did she not tell us that orphan
      children were watched over by guardian angels? Well, Gabriel is our
      guardian angel; he will protect us, and he will protect you also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of him to think of me; but you see, my dear children, for
      the matter of defence, I prefer the dog; he is less fair than your angel,
      but he has better teeth, and that is more to be depended on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How provoking you are, Dagobert&mdash;always jesting!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; you can laugh at everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am astonishingly gay; I laugh with my teeth shut, in the
      style of old Jovial. Come, children, don&rsquo;t scold me: I know I am
      wrong. The remembrance of your dear mother is mixed with this dream, and
      you do well to speak of it seriously. Besides,&rdquo; added he, with a
      grave air, &ldquo;dreams will sometimes come true. In Spain, two of the
      Empress&rsquo;s dragoons, comrades of mine, dreamt, the night before their
      death, that they would be poisoned by the monks&mdash;and so it happened.
      If you continue to dream of this fair angel Gabriel, it is&mdash;it is&mdash;why,
      it is, because you are amused by it; and, as you have none too many
      pleasures in the daytime, you may as well get an agreeable sleep at night.
      But, now, my children, I have also much to tell you; it will concern your
      mother; promise me not to be sad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied! when we think of her we are not sad, though serious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well. For fear of grieving you, I have always delayed the
      moment of telling what your poor mother would have confided to you as soon
      as you were no longer children. But she died before she had time to do so,
      and that which I have to tell broke her heart&mdash;as it nearly did mine.
      I put off this communication as long as I could, taking for pretext that I
      would say nothing till we came to the field of battle where your father
      was made prisoner. That gave me time; but the moment is now come; I can
      shuffle it off no longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We listen, Dagobert,&rdquo; responded the two maidens, with an
      attentive and melancholy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which he appeared to reflect, the
      veteran thus addressed the young girls:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father, General Simon, was the son of a workman, who remained
      a workman; for, notwithstanding all that the general could say or do, the
      old man was obstinate in not quitting his trade. He had a heart of gold
      and a head of iron, just like his son. You may suppose, my children, that
      when your father, who had enlisted as a private soldier, became a general
      and a count of the empire, it was not without toil or without glory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A count of the Empire! what is that, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flummery&mdash;a title, which the Emperor gave over and above the
      promotion, just for the sake of saying to the people, whom he loved
      because he was one of them: Here, children! You wish to play at nobility!
      You shall be nobles. You wish to play at royalty! You shall be kings. Take
      what you like&mdash;nothing is too good for you&mdash;enjoy yourselves!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kings!&rdquo; said the two girls, joining their hands in
      admiration.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10073.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kings of the first water. Oh, he was no niggard of his crowns, our
      Emperor! I had a bed-fellow of mine, a brave soldier, who was afterwards
      promoted to be king. This flattered us; for, if it was not one, it was the
      other. And so, at this game, your father became count; but, count or not,
      he was one of the best and bravest generals of the army.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was handsome, was he not, Dagobert?&mdash;mother always said so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! indeed he was&mdash;but quite another thing from your fair
      guardian angel. Picture to yourself a fine, dark man, who looked splendid
      in his full uniform, and could put fire into the soldiers&rsquo; hearts.
      With him to lead, we would have charged up into Heaven itself&mdash;that
      is, if Heaven had, permitted it,&rdquo; added Dagobert, not wishing to
      wound in any way the religious beliefs of the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And father was as good as he was brave, Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, my children? Yes, I should say so!&mdash;He could bend a
      horse-shoe in his hand as you would bend a card, and the day he was taken
      prisoner he had cut down the Prussian artillerymen on their very cannon.
      With strength and courage like that, how could he be otherwise than good?
      It is then about nineteen years ago, not far from this place&mdash;on the
      spot I showed you before we arrived at the village&mdash;that the general,
      dangerously wounded, fell from his horse. I was following him at the time,
      and ran to his assistance. Five minutes after we were made prisoners&mdash;and
      by whom think you?&mdash;by a Frenchman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Frenchman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an emigrant marquis, a colonel in the service of Russia,&rdquo;
      answered Dagobert, with bitterness. &ldquo;And so, when this marquis
      advanced towards us, and said to the general: &lsquo;Surrender, sir, to a
      countryman!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A Frenchman, who fights against France,&rsquo;
      replied the general, &lsquo;is no longer my countryman; he is a traitor,
      and I&rsquo;d never surrender to a traitor!&rsquo; And, wounded though he
      was, he dragged himself up to a Russian grenadier, and delivered him his
      sabre, saying: &lsquo;I surrender to you my brave fellow!&rsquo; The
      marquis became pale with rage at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans looked at each other with pride, and a rich crimson mantled
      their cheeks, as they exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, our brave father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, those children,&rdquo; said Dagobert, as he proudly twirled his
      moustache. &ldquo;One sees they have soldier&rsquo;s blood in their veins!
      Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we were now prisoners. The general&rsquo;s
      last horse had been killed under him; and, to perform the journey, he
      mounted Jovial, who had not been wounded that day. We arrived at Warsaw,
      and there it was that the general first saw your mother. She was called
      the Pearl of Warsaw; that is saying everything. Now he, who admired all
      that is good and beautiful, fell in love with her almost immediately; and
      she loved him in return; but her parents had promised her to another&mdash;and
      that other was the same&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert was unable to proceed. Rose uttered a piercing cry, and pointed
      in terror to the window.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE TRAVELER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Upon the cry of the young girl, Dagobert rose abruptly.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Rose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;there!&rdquo; she said, pointing to the window. &ldquo;I
      thought I saw a hand move the pelisse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not concluded these words before Dagobert rushed to the window and
      opened it, tearing down the mantle, which had been suspended from the
      fastening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still dark night, and the wind was blowing hard. The soldier
      listened, but could hear nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to fetch the lamp from the table, he shaded the flame with his
      hand, and strove to throw the light outside. Still he saw nothing.
      Persuaded that a gust of wind had disturbed and shaken the pelisse: and
      that Rose had been deceived by her own fears he again shut the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, children! The wind is very high; it is that which
      lifted the corner of the pelisse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet methought I saw plainly the fingers which had hold of it,&rdquo;
      said Rose, still trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking at Dagobert,&rdquo; said Blanche, &ldquo;and I saw
      nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing to see, my children; the thing is clear enough.
      The window is at least eight feet above the ground; none but a giant could
      reach it without a ladder. Now, had any one used a ladder, there would not
      have been time to remove it; for, as soon as Rose cried out, I ran to the
      window, and, when I held out the light, I could see nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have been deceived,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure, sister, it was only the wind,&rdquo; added
      Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I beg pardon for having disturbed you, my good Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; replied the soldier musingly, &ldquo;I am only
      sorry that Spoil sport is not come back. He would have watched the window,
      and that would have quite tranquillized you. But he no doubt scented the
      stable of his comrade, Jovial, and will have called in to bid him
      good-night on the road. I have half a mind to go and fetch him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Dagobert! do not leave us alone,&rdquo; cried the maidens;
      &ldquo;we are too much afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the dog is not likely to remain away much longer, and I am
      sure we shall soon hear him scratching at the door, so we will continue
      our story,&rdquo; said Dagobert, as he again seated himself near the head
      of the bed, but this time with his face towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the general was prisoner at Warsaw,&rdquo; continued he,
      &ldquo;and in love with your mother, whom they wished to marry to another.
      In 1814, we learned the finish of the war, the banishment of the Emperor
      to the Isle of Elba, and the return of the Bourbons. In concert with the
      Prussians and Russians, who had brought them back, they had exiled the
      Emperor. Learning all this, your mother said to the general: &lsquo;The
      war is finished; you are free, but your Emperor is in trouble. You owe
      everything to him; go and join him in his misfortunes. I know not when we
      shall meet again, but I shall never marry any one but you, I am yours till
      death!&rsquo;&mdash;Before he set out the general called me to him, and
      said: &lsquo;Dagobert, remain here; Mademoiselle Eva may have need of you
      to fly from her family, if they should press too hard upon her; our
      correspondence will have to pass through your hands; at Paris, I shall see
      your wife and son; I will comfort them, and tell them you are my friend.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the same,&rdquo; said Rose, with emotion, as she looked
      affectionately at Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As faithful to the father and mother as to their children,&rdquo;
      added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To love one was to love them all,&rdquo; replied the soldier.
      &ldquo;Well, the general joined the Emperor at Elba; I remained at Warsaw,
      concealed in the neighborhood of your mother&rsquo;s house; I received the
      letters, and conveyed them to her clandestinely. In one of those letters&mdash;I
      feel proud to tell you of it my children&mdash;the general informed me
      that the Emperor himself had remembered me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, did he know you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, I flatter myself&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! Dagobert!&rsquo; said
      he to your father, who was talking to him about me; &lsquo;a
      horse-grenadier of my old guard&mdash;a soldier of Egypt and Italy,
      battered with wounds&mdash;an old dare-devil, whom I decorated with my own
      hand at Wagram&mdash;I have not forgotten him!&rsquo;&mdash;I vow,
      children, when your mother read that to me, I cried like a fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor&mdash;what a fine golden face he has on the silver
      cross with the red ribbon that you would sometimes show us when we behaved
      well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cross&mdash;given by him&mdash;is my relic. It is there in my
      knapsack, with whatever we have of value&mdash;our little purse and
      papers. But, to return to your mother; it was a great consolation to her,
      when I took her letters from the general, or talked with her about him&mdash;for
      she suffered much&mdash;oh, so much! In vain her parents tormented and
      persecuted her; she always answered: &lsquo;I will never marry any one but
      General Simon.&rsquo; A spirited woman, I can tell you&mdash;resigned, but
      wonderfully courageous. One day she received a letter from the general; he
      had left the Isle of Elba with the Emperor; the war had again broken out,
      a short campaign, but as fierce as ever, and heightened by soldiers&rsquo;
      devotion. In that campaign of France; my children, especially at
      Montmirail, your father fought like a lion, and his division followed his
      example it was no longer valor&mdash;it was frenzy. He told me that, in
      Champagne, the peasants killed so many of those Prussians, that their
      fields were manured with them for years. Men, women, children, all rushed
      upon them. Pitchforks, stones, mattocks, all served for the slaughter. It
      was a true wolf hunt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veins swelled on the soldier&rsquo;s forehead, and his cheeks flushed
      as he spoke, for this popular heroism recalled to his memory the sublime
      enthusiasm of the wars of the republic&mdash;those armed risings of a
      whole people, from which dated the first steps of his military career, as
      the triumphs of the Empire were the last days of his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans, too, daughters of a soldier and a brave woman, did not shrink
      from the rough energy of these words, but felt their cheeks glow, and
      their hearts beat tumultuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy we are to be the children of so brave a father!&rdquo;
      cried Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a happiness and an honor too, my children&mdash;for the
      evening of the battle of Montmirail, the Emperor, to the joy of the whole
      army, made your father Duke of Ligny and Marshal of France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshal of France!&rdquo; said Rose in astonishment, without
      understanding the exact meaning of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duke of Ligny!&rdquo; added Blanche with equal surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Peter Simon, the son of a workman, became duke and marshal&mdash;there
      is nothing higher except a king!&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, proudly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      how the Emperor treated the sons of the people, and, therefore, the people
      were devoted to him. It was all very fine to tell them &lsquo;Your Emperor
      makes you food for cannon.&rsquo; &lsquo;Stuff!&rsquo; replied the people,
      who are no fools, &lsquo;another would make us food for misery. We prefer
      the cannon, with the chance of becoming captain or colonel, marshal, king&mdash;or
      invalid; that&rsquo;s better than to perish with hunger, cold, and age, on
      straw in a garret, after toiling forty years for others.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in France&mdash;even in Paris, that beautiful city&mdash;do
      you mean to say there are poor people who die of hunger and misery,
      Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in Paris? Yes, my children; therefore, I come back to the
      point, the cannon is better. With it, one has the chance of becoming, like
      your father, duke and marshal: when I say duke and marshal, I am partly
      right and partly wrong, for the title and the rank were not recognized in
      the end; because, after Montmirail, came a day of gloom, a day of great
      mourning, when, as the general has told me, old soldiers like myself wept&mdash;yes,
      wept!&mdash;on the evening of a battle. That day, my children, was
      Waterloo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in these simple words of Dagobert an expression of such deep
      sorrow, that it thrilled the hearts of the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; resumed the soldier, with a sigh, &ldquo;there are
      days which seem to have a curse on them. That same day, at Waterloo, the
      general fell, covered with wounds, at the head of a division of the
      Guards. When he was nearly cured, which was not for a long time, he
      solicited permission to go to St. Helena&mdash;another island at the far
      end of the world, to which the English had carried the Emperor, to torture
      him at their leisure; for if he was very fortunate in the first instance,
      he had to go through a deal of hard rubs at last, my poor children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you talk in that way, you will make us cry, Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is cause enough for it&mdash;the Emperor suffered so much! He
      bled cruelly at the heart believe me. Unfortunately, the general was not
      with him at St. Helena; he would have been one more to console him; but
      they would not allow him to go. Then, exasperated, like so many others,
      against the Bourbons, the general engaged in a conspiracy to recall the
      son of the Emperor. He relied especially on one regiment, nearly all
      composed of his old soldiers, and he went down to a place in Picardy,
      where they were then in garrison; but the conspiracy had already been
      divulged. Arrested the moment of his arrival, the general was taken before
      the colonel of the regiment. And this colonel,&rdquo; said the soldier,
      after a brief pause, &ldquo;who do you think it was again? Bah! it would
      be too long to tell you all, and would only make you more sad; but it was
      a man whom your father had many reasons to hate. When he found himself
      face to face with him, he said: &lsquo;if you are not a coward, you will
      give me one hour&rsquo;s liberty, and we will fight to the death; I hate
      you for this, I despise you for that&rsquo;&mdash;and so on. The colonel
      accepted the challenge, and gave your father his liberty till the morrow.
      The duel was a desperate one; the colonel was left for dead on the spot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general was yet wiping his sword, when a faithful friend came
      to him, and told him he had only just time to save himself. In fact, he
      happily succeeded in leaving France&mdash;yes, happily&mdash;for a
      fortnight after, he was condemned to death as a conspirator.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What misfortunes, good heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was some luck, however, in the midst of his troubles. Your
      mother had kept her promise bravely, and was still waiting for him. She
      had written to him: &lsquo;The Emperor first, and me next!&rsquo; both
      unable to do anything more for the Emperor, nor even for his son, the
      general, banished from France, set out for Warsaw. Your mother had lost
      her parents, and was now free; they were married&mdash;and I am one of the
      witnesses to the marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Dagobert; that was great happiness in the midst of
      great misfortunes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they were very happy; but, as it happened with all good
      hearts, the happier they were themselves, the more they felt for the
      sorrows of others&mdash;and there was quite enough to grieve them at
      Warsaw. The Russians had again begun to treat the Poles as their slaves;
      your brave mother, though of French origin, was a Pole in heart and soul;
      she spoke out boldly what others did not dare speak in a whisper, and all
      the unfortunate called her their protecting angel. That was enough to
      excite the suspicions of the Russian governor. One day, a friend of the
      general&rsquo;s, formerly a colonel in the lancers, a brave and worthy
      man, was condemned to be exiled to Siberia for a military plot against the
      Russians. He took refuge in your father&rsquo;s house, and lay hid there;
      but his retreat was discovered. During the next night, a party of
      Cossacks, commanded by an officer, and followed by a travelling-carriage,
      arrive at our door; they rouse the general from his sleep and take him
      away with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heaven! what did they mean to do with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conduct him out of the Russian dominions, with a charge never to
      return, on pain of perpetual imprisonment. His last words were: &lsquo;Dagobert,
      I entrust to thee my wife and child!&rsquo;&mdash;for it wanted yet some
      months of the time when you were to be born. Well, notwithstanding that,
      they exiled your mother to Siberia; it was an opportunity to get rid of
      her; she did too much good at Warsaw, and they feared her accordingly. Not
      content with banishing her, they confiscated all her property; the only
      favor she could obtain was, that I should accompany her, and, had it not
      been for Jovial, whom the general had given to me, she would have had to
      make the journey on foot. It was thus, with her on horseback, and I
      leading her as I lead you, my children, that we arrived at the
      poverty-stricken village, where, three months after, you poor little
      things were born!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was impossible for him to return to Russia; impossible for your
      mother to think of flight, with two children; impossible for the general
      to write to her, as he knew not where she was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, since that time, you have had no news of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my children&mdash;once we had news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Dagobert resumed with a singular
      expression of countenance: &ldquo;By whom?&mdash;by one who is not like
      other men. Yes&mdash;that you may understand me better, I will relate to
      you an extraordinary adventure, which happened to your father during his
      last French campaign. He had been ordered by the Emperor to carry a
      battery, which was playing heavily on our army; after several unsuccessful
      efforts, the general put himself at the head of a regiment of cuirassiers,
      and charged the battery, intending, as was his custom, to cut down the men
      at their guns. He was on horseback, just before the mouth of a cannon,
      where all the artillerymen had been either killed or wounded, when one of
      them still found strength to raise himself upon one knee, and to apply the
      lighted match to the touchhole&mdash;and that when your father was about
      ten paces in front of the loaded piece.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a peril for our father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, he told me, had he run such imminent danger for he saw the
      artilleryman apply the match, and the gun go off&mdash;but, at the very
      nick, a man of tall stature, dressed as a peasant, and whom he had not
      before remarked, threw himself in front of the cannon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate creature! what a horrible death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dagobert, thoughtfully; &ldquo;it should have been
      so. He ought by rights to have been blown into a thousand pieces. But no&mdash;nothing
      of the kind!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you tell us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the general told me. &lsquo;At the moment when the gun went
      off,&rsquo; as he often repeated to me, &lsquo;I shut my eyes by an
      involuntary movement, that I might not see the mutilated body of the poor
      wretch who had sacrificed himself in my place. When I again opened them,
      the first thing I saw in the midst of the smoke, was the tall figure of
      this man, standing erect and calm on the same spot, and casting a sad mild
      look on the artilleryman, who, with one knee on the ground, and his body
      thrown backward, gazed on him in as much terror as if he had been the
      devil. Afterwards, I lost sight of this man in the tumult,&rsquo; added
      your father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me Dagobert! how can this be possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I said to the general. He answered me that he had
      never been able to explain to himself this event, which seemed as
      incredible as it was true. Moreover, your father must have been greatly
      struck with the countenance of this man, who appeared, he said, about
      thirty years of age&mdash;for he remarked, that his extremely black
      eyebrows were joined together, and formed, as it were, one line from
      temple to temple, so that he seemed to have a black streak across his
      forehead. Remember this, my children; you will soon see why.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dagobert! we shall not forget it,&rdquo; said the orphans,
      growing more and more astonished as he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not strange&mdash;this man with a black seam on his forehead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shall hear. The general had, as I told you, been left for
      dead at Waterloo. During the night which he passed on the field of battle,
      in a sort of delirium brought on by the fever of his wounds, he saw, or
      fancied he saw, this same man bending over him, with a look of great
      mildness and deep melancholy, stanching his wounds, and using every effort
      to revive him. But as your father, whose senses were still wandering,
      repulsed his kindness saying, that after such a defeat, it only remained
      to die&mdash;it appeared as if this man replied to him; &lsquo;You must
      live for Eva!&rsquo; meaning your mother, whom the general had left at
      Warsaw, to join the Emperor, and make this campaign of France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange, Dagobert!&mdash;And since then, did our father never
      see this man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he saw him&mdash;for it was he who brought news of the general
      to your poor mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that? We never heard of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember that, on the day your mother died, you went to the
      pine forest with old Fedora?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Rose, mournfully; &ldquo;to fetch some heath,
      of which our mother was so fond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mother!&rdquo; added Blanche; &ldquo;she appeared so well that
      morning, that we could not dream of the calamity which awaited us before
      night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, my children; I sang and worked that morning in the garden,
      expecting, no more than you did, what was to happen. Well, as I was
      singing at my work, on a sudden I heard a voice ask me in French: &lsquo;Is
      this the village of Milosk?&rsquo;&mdash;I turned round, and saw before me
      a stranger; I looked at him attentively, and, instead of replying, fell
      back two steps, quite stupefied.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was of tall stature, very pale, with a high and open forehead;
      but his eyebrows met, and seemed to form one black streak across it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was the same man who had twice been with our father in
      battle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it was he.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dagobert,&rdquo; said Rose, thoughtfully, &ldquo;is it not a
      long time since these battles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About sixteen years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what age was this stranger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly more than thirty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can it be the same man, who sixteen years before, had been
      with our father in the wars?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Dagobert, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, and shrugging his shoulders: &ldquo;I may have been deceived by a
      chance likeness&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, if it were the same, he could not have got older all that
      while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you ask him, if he had not formerly relieved our father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first I was so surprised that I did not think of it; and
      afterwards, he remained so short a time, that I had no opportunity. Well,
      he asked me for the village of Milosk. &lsquo;You are there, sir,&rsquo;
      said I, &lsquo;but how do you know that I am a Frenchman?&rsquo; &lsquo;I
      heard you singing as I passed,&rsquo; replied he; &lsquo;could you tell me
      the house of Madame Simon, the general&rsquo;s wife?&rsquo; &lsquo;She
      lives here, sir.&rsquo; Then looking at me for some seconds in silence, he
      took me by the hand and said: &lsquo;You are the friend of General Simon&mdash;his
      best friend?&rsquo; Judge of my astonishment, as I answered: &lsquo;But,
      sir, how do you know?&rsquo; &lsquo;He has often spoken of you with
      gratitude.&rsquo; &lsquo;You have seen the general then?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,
      some time ago, in India. I am also his friend: I bring news of him to his
      wife, whom I knew to be exiled in Siberia. At Tobolsk, whence I come, I
      learned that she inhabits this village. Conduct me to her!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good traveller&mdash;I love him already,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, being father&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begged him to wait an instant, whilst I went to inform your
      mother, so that the surprise might not do her harm; five minutes after, he
      was beside her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what kind of man was this traveller, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very tall; he wore a dark pelisse, and a fur cap, and had
      long black hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he handsome?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my children&mdash;very handsome; but with so mild and
      melancholy an air, that it pained my heart to see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! he had doubtless known some great sorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother had been closeted with him for some minutes, when she
      called me to her and said that she had just received good news of the
      general. She was in tears, and had before her a large packet of papers; it
      was a kind of journal, which your father had written every evening to
      console himself; not being able to speak to her, he told the paper all
      that he would have told her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! where are these papers, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, in the knapsack, with my cross and our purse. One day I will
      give them to you: but I have picked out a few leaves here and there for
      you to read presently. You will see why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had our father been long in India?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gathered from the few words which your mother said, that the
      general had gone to that country, after fighting for the Greeks against
      the Turks&mdash;for he always liked to side with the weak against the
      strong. In India he made fierce war against the English, they had murdered
      our prisoners in pontoons, and tortured the Emperor at St. Helena, and the
      war was a doubly good one, for in harming them he served a just cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cause did he serve then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of one of the poor native princes, whose territories the
      English, lay waste, till the day when they can take possession of them
      against law and right. You see, my children, it was once more the weak
      against the strong, and your father did not miss this opportunity. In a
      few months he had so well-trained and disciplined the twelve or fifteen
      thousand men of the prince, that, in two encounters, they cut to pieces
      the English sent against them, and who, no doubt, had in their reckoning
      left out your brave father, my children. But come, you shall read some
      pages of his journal, which will tell you more and better than I can.
      Moreover, you will find in them a name which you ought always to remember;
      that&rsquo;s why I chose this passage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what happiness! To read the pages written by our father, is
      almost to hear him speak,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as if he were close beside us,&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the girls stretched out their hands with eagerness, to catch hold of
      the leaves that Dagobert had taken from his pocket. Then, by a
      simultaneous movement, full of touching grace, they pressed the writing of
      their father in silence to their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see also, my children, at the end of this letter, why I
      was surprised that your guardian angel, as you say, should be called
      Gabriel. Read, read,&rdquo; added the soldier, observing the puzzled air
      of the orphans. &ldquo;Only I ought to tell you that, when he wrote this,
      the general had not yet fallen in with the traveller who brought the
      papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, sitting up in her bed, took the leaves, and began to read in a soft
      and trembling voice, Blanche, with her head resting on her sister&rsquo;s
      shoulder, followed attentively every word. One could even see, by the
      slight motion of her lips, that she too was reading, but only to herself.

      CHAPTER VIII. EXTRACTS FROM GENERAL SIMON&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Bivouac on the Mountains of Avers February the 20th, 1830.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each time I add some pages to this journal, written now in the
      heart of India, where the fortune of my wandering and proscribed existence
      has thrown me&mdash;a journal which, alas! my beloved Eva, you may never
      read&mdash;I experience a sweet, yet painful emotion; for, although to
      converse thus with you is a consolation, it brings back the bitter thought
      that I am unable to see or speak to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, if these pages should ever meet your eyes, your generous
      heart will throb at the name of the intrepid being, to whom I am this day
      indebted for my life, and to whom I may thus perhaps owe the happiness of
      seeing you again&mdash;you and my child&mdash;for of course our child
      lives. Yes, it must be&mdash;for else, poor wife, what an existence would
      be yours amid the horrors of exile! Dear soul! he must now be fourteen.
      Whom does he resemble? Is he like you? Has he your large and beautiful
      blue eyes?&mdash;Madman that I am! how many times, in this long day-book,
      have I already asked the same idle question, to which you can return no
      answer!&mdash;How many times shall I continue to ask it?&mdash;But you
      will teach our child to speak and love the somewhat savage name of Djalma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma!&rdquo; said Rose, as with moist eyes she left off reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma!&rdquo; repeated Blanche, who shared the emotion of her
      sister. &ldquo;Oh, we shall never forget that name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will do well, my children; for it seems to be the name of a
      famous soldier, though a very young one. But go on, my little Rose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you in the preceding pages, my dear Eva, of the two
      glorious days we had this month. The troops of my old friend, the prince,
      which daily make fresh advances in European discipline, have performed
      wonders. We have beaten the English, and obliged them to abandon a portion
      of this unhappy country, which they had invaded in contempt of all the
      rights of justice, and which they continue to ravage without mercy, for,
      in these parts, warfare is another name for treachery, pillage, and
      massacre. This morning, after a toilsome march through a rocky and
      mountainous district, we received information from our scouts, that the
      enemy had been reinforced, and was preparing to act on the offensive; and,
      as we were separated from them by a distance of a few leagues only, an
      engagement became inevitable. My old friend the prince, the father of my
      deliverer, was impatient to march to the attack. The action began about
      three o&rsquo;clock; it was very bloody and furious. Seeing that our men
      wavered for a moment, for they were inferior in number, and the English
      reinforcements consisted of fresh troops, I charged at the head of our
      weak reserve of cavalry. The old prince was in the centre, fighting, as he
      always fights, intrepidly; his son, Djalma, scarcely eighteen, as brave as
      his father, did not leave my side. In the hottest part of the engagement,
      my horse was killed under me, and rolling over into a ravine, along the
      edge of which I was riding, I found myself so awkwardly entangled beneath
      him, that for an instant I thought my thigh was broken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor father!&rdquo; said Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time, happily, nothing more dangerous ensued thanks to Djalma!
      You see, Dagobert,&rdquo; added Rose, &ldquo;that I remember the name.&rdquo;
      And she continued to read,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English thought&mdash;and a very flattering opinion it was&mdash;that,
      if they could kill me, they would make short work of the prince&rsquo;s
      army. So a Sepoy officer, with five or six irregulars&mdash;cowardly,
      ferocious plunderers&mdash;seeing me roll down the ravine, threw
      themselves into it to despatch me. Surrounded by fire and smoke, and
      carried away by their ardor, our mountaineers had not seen me fall; but
      Djalma never left me. He leaped into the ravine to my assistance, and his
      cool intrepidity saved my life. He had held the fire of his
      double-barrelled carbine; with one load, he killed the officer on the
      spot; with the other he broke the arm of an irregular, who had already
      pierced my left hand with his bayonet. But do not be alarmed, dear Eva; it
      is nothing&mdash;only a scratch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded&mdash;again wounded&mdash;alas!&rdquo; cried Blanche,
      clasping her hands together, and interrupting her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take courage!&rdquo; said Dagobert: &ldquo;I dare say it was only a
      scratch, as the general calls it. Formerly, he used to call wounds, which
      did not disable a man from fighting, blank wounds. There was no one like
      him for such sayings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma, seeing me wounded,&rdquo; resumed Rose, wiping her eyes,
      &ldquo;made use of his heavy carbine as a club, and drove back the
      soldiers. At that instant, I perceived a new assailant, who, sheltered
      behind a clump of bamboos which commanded the ravine, slowly lowered his
      long gun, placed the barrel between two branches, and took deliberate aim
      at Djalma. Before my shouts could apprise him of his danger, the brave
      youth had received a ball in his breast. Feeling himself hit, he fell bark
      involuntarily two paces, and dropped upon one knee: but he still remained
      firm, endeavoring to cover me with his body. You may conceive my rage and
      despair, whilst all my efforts to disengage myself were paralyzed by the
      excruciating pain in my thigh. Powerless and disarmed, I witnessed for
      some moments this unequal struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma was losing blood rapidly; his strength of arm began to fail
      him; already one of the irregulars, inciting his comrades with his voice,
      drew from his belt a huge, heavy kind of bill-hook, when a dozen of our
      mountaineers made their appearance, borne towards the spot by the
      irresistible current of the battle. Djalma was rescued in his turn, I was
      released, and, in a quarter of an hour, I was able to mount a horse. The
      fortune of the day is ours, though with severe loss; but the fires of the
      English camp are still visible, and to-morrow the conflict will be
      decisive. Thus, my beloved Eva, I owe my life to this youth. Happily, his
      wound occasions us no uneasiness; the ball only glanced along the ribs in
      a slanting direction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brave boy might have said: &lsquo;A blank wound,&rsquo; like
      the general,&rdquo; observed Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear Eva,&rdquo; continued Rose, &ldquo;you must become
      acquainted, by means of this narrative at least, with the intrepid Djalma.
      He is but just eighteen. With one word, I will paint for you his noble and
      valiant nature; it is a custom of this country to give surnames, and, when
      only fifteen, he was called &lsquo;The Generous&rsquo;&mdash;by which was,
      of course, meant generous in heart and mind. By another custom, no less
      touching than whimsical, this name was reverted to his parent, who is
      called &lsquo;The Father of the Generous,&rsquo; and who might, with equal
      propriety, be called &lsquo;The Just,&rsquo; for this old Indian is a rare
      example of chivalrous honor and proud independence. He might, like so many
      other poor princes of this country, have humbled himself before the
      execrable despotism of the English, bargained for the relinquishment of
      sovereign power, and submitted to brute force&mdash;but it was not in his
      nature. &lsquo;My whole rights, or a grave in my native mountains!&rsquo;&mdash;such
      is his motto. And this is no empty boast; it springs from the conviction
      of what is right and just. &lsquo;But you will be crushed in the struggle,&rsquo;
      I have said to him&mdash;&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;what
      if, to force you to a disgraceful act, you were told to yield or die?&rsquo;&mdash;From
      that day I understood him, and have devoted myself, mind and body, to the
      ever sacred cause of the weak against the strong. You see, my Eva, that
      Djalma shows himself worthy of such a father. This young Indian is so
      proud, so heroic in his bravery, that, like a young Greek of Leonidas&rsquo;
      age, he fights with his breast bare; while other warriors of his country
      (who, indeed, usually have arms, breast, and shoulders uncovered) wear, in
      time of battle, a thick, impenetrable vest. The rash daring of this youth
      reminds me of Murat, King of Naples, who, I have so often told you, I have
      seen a hundred times leading the most desperate charges with nothing but a
      riding-whip in his hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of those kings I was telling you of, whom the
      Emperor set up for his amusement,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;I once saw
      a Prussian officer prisoner, whose face had been cut across by that
      mad-cap King of Naples&rsquo; riding-whip; the mark was there, a black and
      blue stripe. The Prussian swore he was dishonored, and that a sabre-cut
      would have been preferable. I should rather think so! That devil of a
      king; he only had one idea: &lsquo;Forward, on to the cannon!&rsquo; As
      soon as they began to cannonade, one would have thought the guns were
      calling him with all their might, for he was soon up to them with his
      &lsquo;Here I am!&rsquo; If I speak to you about him, my children, it&rsquo;s
      because he was fond of repeating,&mdash;&lsquo;No one can break through a
      square of infantry, if General Simon or I can&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have observed with pain, that, notwithstanding his youth, Djalma
      is often subject to fits of deep melancholy. At times, I have seen him
      exchange with his father looks of singular import. In spite of our mutual
      attachment, I believe that both conceal from me some sad family secret, in
      so far as I can judge from expressions which have dropped from them by
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It relates to some strange event which their vivid imaginations
      have invested with a supernatural character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, my love, you and I have no longer the right to smile at
      the credulity of others. I, since the French campaign, when I met with
      that extraordinary adventure, which, to this day, I am quite unable to
      understand&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This refers to the man who threw himself before the mouth of the
      cannon,&rdquo; said Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; continued the maiden, still reading, &ldquo;you, my
      dear Eva, since the visits of that young and beautiful woman, whom, as
      your mother asserted, she had seen at her mother&rsquo;s house forty years
      before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans, in amazement, looked at the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother never spoke to me of that, nor the general either, my
      children; this is as strange to me as it is to you.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      With increasing excitement and curiosity, Rose continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, my dear Eva, things which appear very extraordinary, may
      often be explained by a chance resemblance or a freak of nature. Marvels
      being always the result of optical illusion or heated fancy, a time must
      come, when that which appeared to be superhuman or supernatural, will
      prove to be the most simple and natural event in the world. I doubt not,
      therefore, that the things, which we denominate our prodigies, will one
      day receive this commonplace solution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my children&mdash;things appear marvelous, which at bottom
      are quite simple&mdash;though for a long time we understand nothing about
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As our father relates this, we must believe it, and not be
      astonished&mdash;eh, sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, truly&mdash;since it will all be explained one day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said Dagobert, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, &ldquo;you two are so much alike, that any one, who was not in
      the habit of seeing you daily, might easily take one for the other. Well!
      if they did not know that you are, so to speak, &rsquo;doubles,&rsquo; they might
      think an imp was at work instead of such good little angels as you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Dagobert; in this way many things may be explained,
      even as our father says.&rdquo; And Rose continued to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without pride, my gentle Eva, have I learned that Djalma has
      French blood in his veins. His father married, some years ago, a young
      girl, whose family, of French origin, had long been settled at Batavia in
      the island of Java. This similarity of circumstances between my old friend
      and myself&mdash;for your family also, my Eva, is of French origin, and
      long settled in a foreign land&mdash;has only served to augment my
      sympathy for him. Unfortunately, he has long had to mourn the loss of the
      wife whom he adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, my beloved Eva! my hand trembles as I write these words. I am
      weak&mdash;I am foolish&mdash;but, alas! my heart sinks within me. If such
      a misfortune were to happen to me&mdash;Oh, my God!&mdash;what would
      become of our child without thee&mdash;without his father&mdash;in that
      barbarous country? But no! the very fear is madness; and yet what a
      horrible torture is uncertainty! Where may you now be? What are you doing?
      What has become of you? Pardon these black thoughts, which are sometimes
      too much for me. They are the cause of my worst moments&mdash;for, when
      free from them, I can at least say to myself: I am proscribed, I am every
      way unfortunate&mdash;but, at the other end of the world, two hearts still
      beat for me with affection&mdash;yours, my Eva, and our child&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10097m.jpg" alt="10097m " width="100%" /><br />

    </h5>
    <p>
      Rose could hardly finish this passage; for some seconds her voice was
      broken by sobs. There was indeed a fatal coincidence between the fears of
      General Simon and the sad reality; and what could be more touching than
      these outpourings of the heart, written by the light of a watch fire, on
      the eve of battle, by a soldier who thus sought to soothe the pangs of a
      separation, which he felt bitterly, but knew not would be eternal?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor general! he is unaware of our misfortune,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, after a moment&rsquo;s silence; &ldquo;but neither has he heard
      that he has two children, instead of one. That will be at least some
      consolation. But come, Blanche; do go on reading: I fear that this
      dwelling on grief fatigues your sister, and she is too much affected by
      it. Besides, after all, it is only just, that you should take your share
      of its pleasure and its sorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche took the letter, and Rose, having dried her eyes, laid in her turn
      her sweet head on the shoulder of her sister, who thus continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am calmer now, my dear Eva; I left off writing for a moment, and
      strove to banish those black presentiments. Let us resume our
      conversation! After discoursing so long about India, I will talk to you a
      little of Europe. Yesterday evening, one of our people (a trusty fellow)
      rejoined our outposts. He brought me a letter, which had arrived from
      France at Calcutta; at length, I have news of my father, and am no longer
      anxious on his account. This letter is dated in August of last year. I see
      by its contents, that several other letters, to which he alludes, have
      either been delayed or lost; for I had not received any for two years
      before, and was extremely uneasy about him. But my excellent father is the
      same as ever! Age has not weakened him; his character is as energetic, his
      health as robust, as in times past&mdash;still a workman, still proud of
      his order, still faithful to his austere republican ideas, still hoping
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For he says to me, &lsquo;the time is at hand,&rsquo; and he
      underlines those words. He gives me also, as you will see, good news of
      the family of old Dagobert, our friend&mdash;for in truth, my dear Eva, it
      soothes my grief to think, that this excellent man is with you, that he
      will have accompanied you in your exile&mdash;for I know him&mdash;a
      kernel of gold beneath the rude rind of a soldier! How he must love our
      child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Dagobert coughed two or three times, stooped down, and appeared to be
      seeking on the ground the little red and blue check-handkerchief spread
      over his knees. He remained thus bent for some seconds, and, when he
      raised himself, he drew his hand across his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well father knows you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How rightly has he guessed that you would love us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, children; pass over that!&mdash;Let&rsquo;s come to the
      part where the general speaks of my little Agricola, and of Gabriel, my
      wife&rsquo;s adopted child. Poor woman! when I think that in three months
      perhaps&mdash;but come, child, read, read,&rdquo; added the old soldier,
      wishing to conceal his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still hope against hope, my dear Eva, that these pages will one
      day reach you, and therefore I wish to insert in them all that can be
      interesting to Dagobert. It will be a consolation to him, to have some
      news of his family. My father, who is still foreman at Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s,
      tells me that worthy man has also taken into his house the son of old
      Dagobert. Agricola works under my father, who is enchanted with him. He
      is, he tells me, a tall and vigorous lad, who wields the heavy forge
      hammer as if it were a feather, and is light-spirited as he is intelligent
      and laborious. He is the best workman on the establishment; and this does
      not prevent him in the evening, after his hard day&rsquo;s work, when he
      returns home to his mother, whom he truly loves, from making songs and
      writing excellent patriotic verses. His poetry is full of fire and energy;
      his fellow-workmen sing nothing else, and his lays have the power to warm
      the coldest and the most timid hearts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How proud you must be of your son, Dagobert,&rdquo; said Rose, in
      admiration; &ldquo;he writes songs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, it is all very fine&mdash;but what pleases me best is,
      that he is good to his mother, and that he handles the hammer with a will.
      As for the songs, before he makes a &lsquo;Rising of the People,&rsquo; or
      a &lsquo;Marseillaise,&rsquo; he will have had to beat a good deal of
      iron; but where can this rascally sweet Agricola have learned to make
      songs at all?&mdash;No doubt, it was at school, where he went, as you will
      see, with his adopted brother Gabriel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this name of Gabriel, which reminded them of the imaginary being whom
      they called their guardian angel, the curiosity of the young girls was
      greatly excited. With redoubled attention, Blanche continued in these
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The adopted brother of Agricola, the poor deserted child whom the
      wife of our good Dagobert so generously took in, forms, my father tells
      me, a great contrast with Agricola; not in heart, for they have both
      excellent hearts; but Gabriel is as thoughtful and melancholy as Agricola
      is lively, joyous, and active. Moreover, adds my father, each of them, so
      to speak, has the aspect, which belongs to his character. Agricola is
      dark, tall, and strong, with a gay and bold air; Gabriel, on the contrary,
      is weak, fair, timid as a girl, and his face wears an expression of
      angelic mildness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans looked at each other in surprise; then, as they turned towards
      the soldier their ingenuous countenances, Rose said to him; &ldquo;Have
      you heard, Dagobert? Father says, that your Gabriel is fair, and has the
      face of an angel. Why, &lsquo;tis exactly like ours!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I heard very well; it is that which surprised me, in your
      dream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know, if he has also blue eyes,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, my children, though the general says nothing about it,
      I will answer for it: your fair boys have always blue eyes. But, blue or
      black, he will not use them to stare at young ladies; go on, and you will
      see why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His face wears an expression of angelic mildness. One of the
      Brothers of the Christian Schools, where he went with Agricola and other
      children of his quarter, struck with his intelligence and good
      disposition, spoke of him to a person of consequence, who, becoming
      interested in the lad, placed him in a seminary for the clergy, and, since
      the last two years, Gabriel is a priest. He intends devoting himself to
      foreign missions, and will soon set out for America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Gabriel is a priest, it appears?&rdquo; said Rose, looking at
      Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While ours is an angel,&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which only proves that yours is a step higher than mine. Well,
      every one to his taste; there are good people in all trades; but I prefer
      that it should be Gabriel who has chosen the black gown. I&rsquo;d rather
      see my boy with arms bare, hammer in hand, and a leathern apron round him,
      neither more nor less than your old grandfather, my children&mdash;the
      father of Marshal Simon, Duke of Ligny&mdash;for, after all, marshal and
      duke he is by the grace of the Emperor. Now finish your letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon, alas, yes!&rdquo; said Blanche; &ldquo;there are only a few
      lines left.&rdquo; And she proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, my dear, loving Eva, if this journal should ever reach its
      destination, you will be able to satisfy Dagobert as to the position of
      his wife and son, whom he left for our sakes. How can we ever repay such a
      sacrifice? But I feel sure, that your good and generous heart will have
      found some means of compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu!&mdash;Again adieu, for to-day, my beloved Eva; I left off
      writing for a moment, to visit the tent of Djalma. He slept peacefully,
      and his father watched beside him; with a smile, he banished my fears.
      This intrepid young man is no longer in any danger. May he still be spared
      in the combat of to-morrow! Adieu, my gentle Eva! the night is silent and
      calm; the fires of the bivouac are slowly dying out, and our poor
      mountaineers repose after this bloody day; I can hear, from hour to hour,
      the distant all&rsquo;s well of our sentinels. Those foreign words bring
      back my grief; they remind me of what I sometimes forget in writing&mdash;that
      I am faraway, separated from you and from my child! Poor, beloved beings!
      what will be your destiny? Ah! if I could only send you, in time, that
      medal, which, by a fatal accident, I carried away with me from Warsaw, you
      might, perhaps, obtain leave to visit France, or at least to send our
      child there with Dagobert; for you know of what importance&mdash;But why
      add this sorrow to all the rest? Unfortunately, the years are passing
      away, the fatal day will arrive, and this last hope, in which I live for
      you, will also be taken from me: but I will not close the evening by so
      sad a thought. Adieu, my beloved Eva! Clasp our child to your bosom, and
      cover it with all the kisses which I send to both of you from the depths
      of exile!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till to-morrow&mdash;after the battle!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading of this touching letter was followed by long silence. The
      tears of Rose and Blanche flowed together. Dagobert, with his head resting
      on his hand, was absorbed in painful reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without doors, the wind had now augmented in violence; a heavy rain began
      to beat on the sounding panes; the most profound silence reigned in the
      interior of the inn. But, whilst the daughters of General Simon were
      reading with such deep emotion, these fragments of their father&rsquo;s
      journal, a strange and mysterious scene transpired in the menagerie of the
      brute-tamer.

      CHAPTER IX. THE CAGES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>orok had prepared
      himself. Over his deer-skin vest he had drawn the coat of mail&mdash;that
      steel tissue, as pliable as cloth, as hard as diamonds; next, clothing his
      arms and legs in their proper armor, and his feet in iron-bound buskins,
      and concealing all this defensive equipment under loose trousers and an
      ample pelisse carefully buttoned, he took in his hand a long bar of iron,
      white-hot, set in a wooden handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though long ago daunted by the skill and energy of the Prophet, his tiger
      Cain, his lion Judas, and his black panther Death, had sometimes
      attempted, in a moment of rebellion, to try their fangs and claws on his
      person; but, thanks to the armor concealed beneath his pelisse, they
      blunted their claws upon a skin of steel, and notched their fangs upon
      arms or legs of iron, whilst a slight touch of their master&rsquo;s
      metallic wand left a deep furrow in their smoking, shrivelled flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the inutility of their efforts, and endowed with strong memory,
      the beasts soon learned that their teeth and claws were powerless when
      directed against this invulnerable being. Hence, their terrified
      submission reached to such a point that, in his public representations,
      their master could make them crouch and cower at his feet by the least
      movement of a little wand covered with flame-colored paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet, thus armed with care, and holding in his hand the iron made
      hot by Goliath, descended by the trapdoor of the loft into the large shed
      beneath, in which were deposited the cages of his animals. A mere wooden
      partition separated this shed from the stable that contained his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lantern, with a reflector, threw a vivid light on the cages. They were
      four in number. A wide iron grating formed their sides, turning at one end
      upon hinges like a door, so as to give ingress to the animal; the bottom
      of each den rested on two axle-trees and four small iron castors, so that
      they could easily be removed to the large covered wagon in which they were
      placed during a journey. One of them was empty; the other three contained,
      as already intimated, a panther, a tiger, and a lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther, originally from Java, seemed to merit the gloomy name of
      Death, by her grim, ferocious aspect. Completely black, she lay crouching
      and rolled up in the bottom of her cage, and her dark hues mingling with
      the obscurity which surrounded her, nothing was distinctly visible but
      fixed and glaring eyes&mdash;yellow balls of phosphoric light, which only
      kindled, as it were, in the night-time; for it is the nature of all the
      animals of the feline species to enjoy entire clearness of vision but in
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet entered the stable in silence: the dark red of his long
      pelisse contrasted with the pale yellow of his straight hair and beard;
      the lantern, placed at some height above the ground, threw its rays full
      upon this man, and the strong light, opposed to the deep shadows around
      it, gave effect to the sharp proportions of his bony and savage looking
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached the cage slowly. The white rim, which encircled his eyeball,
      appeared to dilate, and his look rivaled in motionless brilliancy the
      steadily sparkling gaze of the panther. Still crouching in the shade, she
      felt already the fascination of that glance; two or three times she
      dropped her eyelids, with a low, angry howl; then, reopening her eyes, as
      if in spite of herself, she kept them fastened immovably on those of the
      Prophet. And now her rounded ears clung to her skull, which was flattened
      like a viper&rsquo;s; the skin of her forehead became convulsively
      wrinkled; she drew in her bristling, but silky muzzle, and twice silently
      opened her jaws, garnished with formidable fangs. From that moment a kind
      of magnetic connection seemed to be established between the man and the
      beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet extended his glowing bar towards the cage, and said, in a
      sharp, imperious tone: &ldquo;Death! come here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The panther rose, but so dragged herself along that her belly and the bend
      of her legs touched the ground. She was three feet high, and nearly five
      in length; her elastic and fleshy spine, the sinews of her thighs as well
      developed as those of a race-horse, her deep chest, her enormous jutting
      shoulders, the nerve and muscle in her short, thick paws&mdash;all
      announced that this terrible animal united vigor with suppleness, and
      strength with agility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok, with his iron wand still extended in the direction of the cage,
      made a step towards the panther. The panther made a stride towards the
      Prophet. Morok stopped; Death stopped also.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the tiger, Judas, to whom Morok&rsquo;s back was turned,
      bounded violently in his cage, as if jealous of the attention, which his
      master paid to the panther. He growled hoarsely, and, raising his head,
      showed the under-part of his redoubtable triangular jaw, and his broad
      chest of a dirty white, with which blended the copper color, streaked with
      black, of his sides; his tail, like a huge red serpent, with rings of
      ebony, now clung to his flanks, now lashed them with a slow and continuous
      movement: his eyes, of a transparent, brilliant green, were fixed upon the
      Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the influence of this man over his animals, that Judas almost
      immediately ceased growling, as if frightened at his own temerity; but his
      respiration continued loud and deep. Morok turned his face towards him,
      and examined him very attentively during some seconds. The panther, no
      longer subject to the influence of her master&rsquo;s look, slunk back to
      crouch in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp cracking, in sudden breaks, like that which great animals make in
      gnawing hard substances, was now heard from the cage of the lion. It drew
      the attention of the Prophet, who, leaving the tiger, advanced towards the
      other den.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be seen of the lion but his monstrous croup of a reddish
      yellow. His thighs were gathered under him, and his thick mane served
      entirely to conceal his head. But by the tension and movement of the
      muscles of his loins, and the curving of his backbone, it was easy to
      perceive that he was making violent efforts with his throat and his
      forepaws. The Prophet approached the cage with same uneasiness, fearing
      that, notwithstanding his orders, Goliath had given the lion some bones to
      gnaw. To assure himself of it, he said in a quick and firm voice: &ldquo;Cain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion did not change his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cain! come here!&rdquo; repeated Morok in a louder tone. The appeal
      was useless; the lion did not move, and the noise continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cain! come here!&rdquo; said the Prophet a third time; but, as he
      pronounced these words, he applied the end of the glowing bar to the
      haunch of the lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely did the light track of smoke appear on the reddish hide of Cain,
      when, with a spring of incredible agility, he turned and threw himself
      against the grating, not crouching, but at a single bound&mdash;upright,
      superb, terrifying. The Prophet being at the angle of the cage, Cain, in
      his fury, had raised himself sideways to face his master, and, leaning his
      huge flank against the bars, thrust between them his enormous fore leg,
      which, with his swollen muscles, was as large as Goliath&rsquo;s thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cain! down!&rdquo; said the Prophet, approaching briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion did not obey immediately. His lips, curling with rage, displayed
      fangs as long, as large, and as pointed as the tusks of a wild boar. But
      Morok touched those lips with the end of the burning metal; and, as he
      felt the smart, followed by an unexpected summons of his master, the lion,
      not daring to roar, uttered a hollow growl, and his great body sank down
      at once in an attitude of submission and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet took down the lantern to see what Cain had been gnawing. It
      was one of the planks from the floor of his den, which he had succeeded in
      tearing up, and was crunching between his teeth in the extremity of his
      hunger. For a few moments the most profound silence reigned in the
      menagerie. The Prophet, with his hands behind his back, went from one cage
      to the other, observing the animals with a restless contemplative look, as
      if he hesitated to make between them an important and difficult choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time he listened at the great door of the shed, which opened
      on the court-yard of the inn. At length this door turned on its hinges,
      and Goliath appeared, his clothes dripping with water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! is it done?&rdquo; said the Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without trouble. Luckily, the night is dark, it blows hard, and
      it pours with rain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no suspicion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, master. Your information was good. The door of the cellar
      opens on the fields, just under the window of the lasses. When you
      whistled to let me know it was time, I crept out with a stool I had
      provided; I put it up against the wall, and mounted upon it; with my six
      feet, that made nine, and I could lean my elbows on the window-ledge; I
      took the shutter in one hand, and the haft of my knife in the other, and,
      whilst I broke two of the panes, I pushed the shutter with all my might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they thought it was the wind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they thought it was the wind. You see, the &lsquo;brute&rsquo;
      is not such a brute, after all. That done, I crept back into my cellar,
      carrying my stool with me. In a little time, I heard the voice of the old
      man; it was well I had made haste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when I whistled to you, he had just entered the supper-room. I
      thought he would have been longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s not built to remain long at supper,&rdquo; said
      the giant, contemptuously. &ldquo;Some moments after the panes had been
      broken, the old man opened the window, and called his dog, saying: &lsquo;Jump
      out!&rsquo;&mdash;I went and hid myself at the further end of the cellar,
      or that infernal dog would have scented me through the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dog is now shut up in the stable with the old man&rsquo;s
      horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I heard them close shutter and window, I came out of my
      cellar, replaced my stool, and again mounted upon it. Unfastening the
      shutter, I opened it without noise, but the two broken panes were stopped
      up with the skirts of a pelisse. I heard talking, but I could see nothing;
      so I moved the pelisse a little, and then I could see the two lasses in
      bed opposite to me, and the old man sitting down with his back to where I
      stood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the knapsack&mdash;the knapsack?&mdash;That is the most
      important.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knapsack was near the window, on a table, by the side of a
      lamp; I could have reached it by stretching out my arm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you hear said?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you told me to think only of the knapsack, I can only remember
      what concerns the knapsack. The old man said he had some papers in it&mdash;the
      letter of a general&mdash;his money&mdash;his cross.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;what next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it was difficult for me to keep the pelisse away from the hole,
      it slipped through my fingers. In trying to get hold of it again, I put my
      hand too much forward. One of the lasses saw it, and screamed out,
      pointing to the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolt!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prophet, becoming pale with rage,
      &ldquo;you have ruined all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit! there is nothing broken yet. When I heard the scream, I
      jumped down from my stool, and got back into the cellar; as the dog was no
      longer about, I left the door ajar, so that I could hear them open the
      window, and see, by the light, that the old man was looking out with the
      lamp; but he could find no ladder, and the window was too high for any man
      of common size to reach it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have thought, like the first time, that it was the wind.
      You are less awkward than I imagined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wolf has become a fox, as you said. Knowing where the knapsack
      was to be found with the money and the papers, and not being able to do
      more for the moment, I came away&mdash;and here I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go upstairs and fetch me the longest pike.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the red blanket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goliath began to mount the ladder; half-way up he stopped. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;may I not bring down a bit of meat for Death?&mdash;you
      will see that she&rsquo;ll bear me malice; she puts it all down to my
      account; she never forgets, and on the first occasion&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pike and the cloth!&rdquo; repeated the Prophet, in an
      imperious tone. And whilst Goliath, swearing to himself, proceeded to
      execute his instructions, Morok opened the great door of the shed, looked
      out into the yard, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the pike and the cloth,&rdquo; said the giant, as he
      descended the ladder with the articles. &ldquo;Now what must I do next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to the cellar, mount once more by the window, and when the
      old man leaves the room&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will make him leave the room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! he will leave it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say the lamp is near the window?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite near&mdash;on the table next to the knapsack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, as soon as the old man leaves the room, push open the
      window, throw down the lamp, and if you accomplish cleverly what remains
      to do&mdash;the ten florins are yours&mdash;you remember it all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls will be so frightened by the noise and darkness, that
      they will remain dumb with terror.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make yourself easy! The wolf turned into a fox; why not a serpent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is yet something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roof of this shed is not very high, the window of the loft is
      easy of access, the night is dark&mdash;instead of returning by the door&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come in at the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and without noise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a regular snake!&rdquo; and the giant departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the Prophet to himself, after a long silence,
      &ldquo;these means are sure. It was not for me to hesitate. A blind and
      obscure instrument, I know not the motives of the orders I have received:
      but from the recommendations which accompany them&mdash;but from the
      position of him who sends them&mdash;immense interests must be involved&mdash;interests
      connected with all that is highest and greatest upon earth!&mdash;And yet
      how can these two girls, almost beggars, how can this wretched soldier
      represent such interests?&mdash;No matter,&rdquo; added he, with humility;
      &ldquo;I am the arm which acts&mdash;it is for the head, which thinks and
      orders, to answer for its work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the Prophet left the shed, carrying with him the red cloth, and
      directed his steps towards the little stable that contained Jovial. The
      crazy door, imperfectly secured by a latch, was easily opened. At sight of
      a stranger Spoil-sport threw himself upon him; but his teeth encountered
      the iron leggings of the Prophet, who, in spite of the efforts of the dog
      took Jovial by his halter, threw the blanket over his head to prevent his
      either seeing or smelling, and led him from the stable into the interior
      of the menagerie, of which he closed the door.

      CHAPTER X. THE SURPRISE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he orphans, after
      reading the journal of their father, remained for some moments silent,
      sad, and pensive, contemplating the leaves yellowed by time. Dagobert,
      also plunged in a reverie, thought of his wife and son, from whom he had
      been so long separated, and hoped soon to see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier was the first to break the silence, which had lasted for
      several minutes. Taking the leaves from the hand of Blanche, he folded
      them carefully, put them into his pocket, and thus addressed the orphans:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, my children! you see what a brave father you have. Think
      only of the pleasure of greeting him, and remember always the name of the
      gallant youth, to whom you will owe that pleasure&mdash;for without him
      your father would have been killed in India.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma! we shall never forget him,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if our guardian angel Gabriel should return,&rdquo; added
      Blanche, &ldquo;we will ask him to watch over Djalma as over ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my children; I am sure that you will forget nothing that
      concerns good feeling. But to return to the traveller, who came to visit
      your poor mother in Siberia, he had seen the general a month after the
      events of which you have read, and at a moment when he was about to enter
      on a new campaign against the English. It was then that your father
      entrusted him with the papers and medal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of what use will this medal be to us, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the meaning of these words engraved upon it?&rdquo;
      added Rose, as she drew it from her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it means, my children, that on the 13th of February, 1832, we
      must be at No. 3, Rue Saint Francois, Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we to do there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor mother was seized so quickly with her last illness, that
      she was unable to tell me. All I know is, that this medal came to her from
      her parents, and that it had been a relic preserved in her family for more
      than a century.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did our father get it?&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the articles which had been hastily thrown into the coach,
      when he was removed by force from Warsaw, was a dressing-case of your
      mother&rsquo;s, in which was contained this medal. Since that time the
      general had been unable to send it back, having no means of communicating
      with us, and not even knowing where we were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This medal is, then, of great importance to us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably; for never, during fifteen years, had I seen your
      mother so happy, as on the day the traveller brought it back to her.
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said she to me, in the presence of the stranger, and
      with tears of joy in her eyes, &lsquo;now may my children&rsquo;s future
      be brilliant as their life has hitherto been miserable. I will entreat of
      the governor of Siberia permission to go to France with my daughters; it
      will perhaps be thought I have been sufficiently punished, by fifteen
      years of exile, and the confiscation of my property. Should they refuse, I
      will remain here; but they will at least allow me to send my children to
      France, and you must accompany them, Dagobert. You shall set out
      immediately, for much time has been already lost; and, if you were not to
      arrive before the 13th of next February, this cruel separation and
      toilsome journey would have been all in vain.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we were one day after?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother told me that if we arrived the 14th instead of the
      13th, it would be too late. She also gave me a thick letter, to put into
      the post for France, in the first town we should pass through&mdash;which
      I have done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think we shall be at Paris in time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so; still, if you are strong enough, we must sometimes make
      forced marches&mdash;for, if we only travel our five leagues a day, and
      that without accident, we shall scarcely reach Paris until the beginning
      of February, and it is better to be a little beforehand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as father is in&mdash;India, and condemned to death if he
      return to France, when shall we see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where shall we see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor children! there are so many things you have yet to learn. When
      the traveller quitted him, the general could not return to France, but now
      he can do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the Bourbons, who had banished him, were themselves turned
      out last year. The news must reach India, and your father will certainly
      come to meet you at Paris, because he expects that you and your mother
      will be there on the 13th of next February.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now I understand how we may hope to see him,&rdquo; said Rose
      with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name of this traveller, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my children; but whether called Jack or John, he is a good
      sort. When he left your mother, she thanked him with tears for all his
      kindness and devotion to the general, herself, and the children; but he
      pressed her hands in his, and said to her, in so gentle a voice that I
      could not help being touched by it: &lsquo;Why do you thank me? Did He not
      Say&mdash;LOVE YE ONE ANOTHER!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of whom did the traveller speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it; only the manner in which he pronounced
      those words struck me, and they were the last he spoke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love one another!&rdquo; repeated Rose, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful are those words!&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whither was the traveller going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far, very far into the North, as he told your mother. When she saw
      him depart, she said to me: &lsquo;His mild, sad talk has affected me even
      to tears; whilst I listened to him, I seemed to be growing better&mdash;I
      seemed to love my husband and my children more&mdash;and yet, to judge by
      the expression of his countenance, one would think that this stranger had
      never either smiled or wept!&rsquo; She and I watched him from the door as
      long as we could follow him with our eyes; he carried his head down, and
      his walk was slow, calm, and firm; one might fancy that he counted his
      steps. And, talking of steps, I remarked yet another thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that the road which led to our house way, always damp,
      because of the overflowing of the little spring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the mark of the traveller&rsquo;s footsteps remained in
      the clay, and I saw that he had nails under his shoe in the form of a
      cross.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the form of a cross?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Dagobert, placing the tip of his finger seven
      times on the coverlet of the bed; &ldquo;they were arrange: thus beneath
      his heel:&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          *
       * * *
          *
          *
          *
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it forms a cross.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could it mean, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance, perhaps&mdash;yes, chance&mdash;and yet, in spite of
      myself, this confounded cross left behind him struck me as a bad omen, for
      hardly was he gone when misfortune after misfortune fell upon us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! the death of our mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but, before that, another piece of ill-luck. You had not
      yet returned, and she was writing her petition to ask leave to go to
      France or to send you there, when I heard the gallop of a horse. It was a
      courier from the governor general of Siberia. He brought us orders to
      change our residence; within three days we were to join other condemned
      persons, and be removed with them four hundred leagues further north.
      Thus, after fifteen years of exile, they redoubled in cruelty towards your
      mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did they thus torment her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think that some evil genius was at work against her. A
      few days later, the traveller would no longer have found us at Milosk; and
      if he had joined us further on, it would have been too far for the medal
      and papers to be of use&mdash;since, having set out almost immediately, we
      shall hardly arrive in time at Paris. &lsquo;If they had some interest to
      prevent me and my children from going to France,&rsquo; said your mother,
      &lsquo;they would act just as they have done. To banish us four hundred
      leagues further, is to render impossible this journey, of which the term
      is fixed.&rsquo; And the idea overwhelmed her with grief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was this unexpected sorrow that was the cause of her
      sudden illness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! no, my children; it was that infernal cholera, who arrives
      without giving you notice&mdash;for he too is a great traveller&mdash;and
      strikes you down like a thunderbolt. Three hours after the traveller had
      left us, when you returned quite pleased and gay from the forest, with
      your large bunches of wild-flowers for your mother, she was already in the
      last agony, and hardly to be recognized. The cholera had broken out in the
      village, and that evening five persons died of it. Your mother had only
      time to hang the medal about your neck, my dear little Rose, to recommend
      you both to my care, and to beg that we should set out immediately. When
      she was gone, the new order of exile could not apply to you; and I
      obtained permission from the governor to take my departure with you for
      France, according to the last wishes&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier could not finish the sentence; he covered his eyes with his
      hand, whilst the orphans embraced him sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, with pride, after a moment of
      painful silence, &ldquo;it was then that you showed yourselves the brave
      daughters of the general. Notwithstanding the danger, it was impossible to
      tear you from your mother&rsquo;s bedside; you remained with her to the
      last, you closed her eyes, you watched there all night, and you would not
      leave the village till you had seen me plant the little wooden cross over
      the grave I had dug for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert paused abruptly. A strange, wild neighing, mingled with ferocious
      roarings, made the soldier start from his seat. He grew pale, and cried:
      &ldquo;It is Jovial! my horse! What are they doing to my horse?&rdquo;
      With that, opening the door he rushed down the stairs precipitately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters clung together, so terrified at the sudden departure of
      the soldier, that they saw not an enormous hand pass through the broken
      panes, unfasten the catch of the window, push it violently open, and throw
      down the lamp placed on the little table, on which was the soldiers&rsquo;s
      knapsack. The orphans thus found themselves plunged into complete
      darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. JOVIAL and DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>orok had led
      Jovial into the middle of the menagerie, and then removed the cloth which
      prevented him from seeing and smelling. Scarcely had the tiger, lion, and
      panther caught a glimpse of him than they threw themselves, half famished,
      against the bars of their dens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse struck with stupor, his neck stretched out, his eye fixed, and
      trembling through all his limbs, appeared as if nailed to the ground; an
      abundant icy sweat rolled suddenly down his flanks. The lion and the tiger
      uttered fearful roarings, and struggled violently in their dens. The
      panther did not roar, but her mute rage was terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a tremendous bound, at the risk of breaking her skull, she sprang
      from the back of the cage against the bars; then, still mute, still
      furious, she crawled back to the extreme corner of the den, and with a new
      spring, as impetuous as it was blind, she again strove to force out the
      iron grating. Three times had she thus bounded&mdash;silent, appalling&mdash;when
      the horse, passing from the immobility of stupor to the wild agony of
      fear, neighed long and loud, and rushed in desperation at the door by
      which he had entered. Finding it closed he hung his head, bent his knees a
      little, and rubbed his nostrils against the opening left between the
      ground and the bottom of the door, as if he wished to inhale the air from
      the outside; then, more and more affrighted, he began to neigh with
      redoubled force, and struck out violently with his fore-feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Death was about once more to make her spring, the
      Prophet approached her cage. The heavy bolt which secured the grating was
      pushed from its staple by the pike of the brute-tamer, and, in another
      second, Morok was half way up the ladder that communicated with the loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roaring of the lion and tiger, mingled with the neighing of Jovial,
      now resounded through all parts of the inn. The panther had again thrown
      herself furiously on the grating, and this time yielding with one spring,
      she was in the middle of the shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the lantern was reflected from the glossy ebon of her hide,
      spotted with stains of a duller black. For an instant she remained
      motionless, crouching upon her thick-set limbs, with her head close to the
      floor, as if calculating the distance of the leap by which she was to
      reach the horse; then suddenly she darted upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing her break from her cage Jovial had thrown himself violently
      against the door, which was made to open inwards, and leaned against it
      with all his might, as though he would force it down. Then, at the moment
      when Death took her leap, he reared up in almost an erect position; but
      she, rapid as lightning, had fastened upon his throat and hung there,
      whilst at the same time she buried the sharp claws of her fore-feet in his
      chest. The jugular vein of the horse opened; a torrent of bright red blood
      spouted forth beneath the tooth of the panther, who, now supporting
      herself on her hind legs, squeezed her victim up against the door, whilst
      she dug into his flank with her claws, and laid bare the palpitating
      flesh. Then his half-strangled neighing became awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly these words resounded: &ldquo;Courage, Jovial!&mdash;I am at
      hand! Courage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the voice of Dagobert, who was exhausting himself in desperate
      exertions to force open the door that concealed this sanguinary struggle.
      &ldquo;Jovial!&rdquo; cried the soldier, &ldquo;I am here. Help! Help!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of that friendly and well-known voice, the poor animal,
      almost at its last gasp, strove to turn its head in the direction whence
      came the accents of his master, answered him with a plaintive neigh, and,
      sinking beneath the efforts of the panther, fell prostrate, first on its
      knees, then upon its flank, so that its backbone lay right across the
      door, and still prevented its being opened. And now all was finished. The
      panther, squatting down upon the horse, crushed him with all her paws,
      and, in spite of some last faint kicks, buried her bloody snout in his
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help! my horse!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, as he vainly shook the
      door. &ldquo;And no arms!&rdquo; he added with rage; &ldquo;no arms!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; exclaimed the brute-tamer, who appeared at the
      window of the loft; &ldquo;do not attempt to enter it might cost you your
      life. My panther is furious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my horse! my horse!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in a voice of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have strayed from his stable during the night, and pushed
      open the door of the shed. At sight of him the panther must have broken
      out of her cage and seized him. You are answerable for all the mischief
      that may ensue,&rdquo; added the brute-tamer, with a menacing air; &ldquo;for
      I shall have to run the greatest danger, to make Death return to her den.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my horse! only save my horse!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in a tone
      of hopeless supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet disappeared from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roaring of the animals and the shouts of Dagobert, had roused from
      sleep every one in the White Falcon. Here and there lights were seen
      moving and windows were thrown open hurriedly. The servants of the inn
      soon appeared in the yard with lanterns, and surrounding Dagobert,
      inquired of him what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My horse is there,&rdquo; cried the soldier, continuing to shake
      the door, &ldquo;and one of that scoundrel&rsquo;s animals has escaped
      from its cage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the people of the inn, already terrified by the frightful
      roaring, fled from the spot and ran to inform the host. The soldier&rsquo;s
      anguish may be conceived, as pale, breathless, with his ear close to the
      chink of the door, he stood listening. By degrees the roaring had ceased,
      and nothing was heard but low growls, accompanied by the stern voice of
      the Prophet, repeating in harsh, abrupt accents: &ldquo;Death! come here!
      Death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was profoundly dark, and Dagobert did not perceive Goliath, who,
      crawling carefully along the tiled roof entered the loft by the attic
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the gate of the court-yard was again opened, and the landlord of
      the inn appeared, followed by a number of men. Armed with a carbine, he
      advanced with precaution; his people carried staves and pitchforks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the row here?&rdquo; said he, as he approached Dagobert.
      &ldquo;What a hubbub in my house! The devil take wild beast showmen, and
      negligent fellows who don&rsquo;t know how to tie a horse to the manger!
      If your beast is hurt, so much the worse for you; you should have taken
      more care of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying to these reproaches, the soldier, who still listened
      attentively to what was going on in the shed, made a sign to entreat
      silence. Suddenly a ferocious roar was heard, followed by a loud scream
      from the Prophet; and, almost immediately after, the panther howled
      piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no doubt the cause of some great accident,&rdquo; said the
      frightened host to the soldier; &ldquo;did you not hear that cry? Morok
      is, perhaps, dangerously wounded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert was about to answer, when the door opened, and Goliath appeared
      on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may enter now,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the danger is over.&rdquo;
    </p>

      The interior of the menagerie presented a singular spectacle. The Prophet,
      pale, and scarcely able to conceal his agitation beneath an apparent air
      of calmness, was kneeling some paces from the cage of the panther, in the
      attitude of one absorbed in himself; the motion of his lips indicating
      that he was praying. At sight of the host and the people of the inn, he
      rose, and said in a solemn voice: &ldquo;I thank thee, my Preserver, that
      I have been able to conquer, by the strength which Thou hast given me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then folding his arms, with haughty brow and imperious glance, he seemed
      to enjoy the triumph he had achieved over Death, who, stretched on the
      bottom of her den, continued to utter plaintive howlings. The spectators
      of this scene, ignorant that the pelisse of the brute-tamer covered a
      complete suit of armor, and attributing the cries of the panther solely to
      fear, were struck with astonishment and admiration at the intrepidity and
      almost supernatural power of this man. A few steps behind him stood
      Goliath, leaning upon the ashen pikestaff. Finally, not far from the cage,
      in the midst of a pool of blood, lay the dead body of Jovial.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the blood-stained and torn remains, Dagobert stood motionless,
      and his rough countenance assumed an expression of the deepest grief:
      then, throwing himself on his knees, he lifted the head of Jovial; and
      when he saw those dull, glassy, and half-closed eyes, once so bright and
      intelligent, as they turned towards a much-loved master, the soldier could
      not suppress an exclamation of bitter anguish. Forgetting his anger,
      forgetting the deplorable consequences of this accident, so fatal to the
      interests of the two maidens, who would thus be prevented from continuing
      their journey&mdash;he thought only of the horrible death of his poor old
      horse, the ancient companion of his fatigues and wars, the faithful
      animal, twice wounded like himself, and from whom for so many years he had
      never been separated. This poignant emotion was so cruelly, so affectingly
      visible in the soldier&rsquo;s countenance, that the landlord and his
      people felt themselves for a moment touched with pity, as they gazed on
      the tall veteran kneeling beside his dead horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when following the course of his regrets, he thought how Jovial had
      also been the companion of his exile, how the mother of the orphans had
      formerly (like her daughters) undertaken a toilsome journey with the aid
      of this unfortunate animal, the fatal consequences of his loss presented
      themselves on a sudden to his mind. Then, fury succeeding to grief, he
      rose, with anger flashing from his eyes, and threw himself on the Prophet;
      with one hand he seized him by the throat, and with the other administered
      five or six heavy blows, which fell harmlessly on the coat of mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rascal! you shall answer to me for my horse&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;
      said the soldier, as he continued his correction. Morok, light and sinewy,
      could not struggle with advantage against Dagobert, who, aided by his tall
      stature, still displayed extraordinary vigor. It needed the intervention
      of Goliath and the landlord to rescue the Prophet from the hands of the
      old grenadier. After some moments, they succeeded in separating the two
      champions. Morok was white with rage. It needed new efforts to prevent his
      seizing the pike to attack Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is abominable!&rdquo; cried the host, addressing the soldier,
      who pressed his clinched fists in despair against his bald forehead.
      &ldquo;You expose this good man to be devoured by his beasts, and then you
      wish to beat him into the bargain. Is this fitting conduct for a
      graybeard? Shall we have to fetch the police? You showed yourself more
      reasonable in the early part of the evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words recalled the soldier to himself. He regretted his impetuosity
      the more, as the fact of his being a stranger might augment the difficulty
      of his position. It was necessary above all to obtain the price of his
      horse, so as to be enabled to continue his journey, the success of which
      might be compromised by a single day&rsquo;s delay. With a violent effort,
      therefore, he succeeded in restraining his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right&mdash;I was too hasty,&rdquo; said he to the host, in
      an agitated voice, which he tried to make as calm as possible. &ldquo;I
      had not the same patience as before. But ought not this man be responsible
      for the loss of my horse? I make you judge in the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, as judge, I am not of your opinion. All this has been
      your own fault. You tied up your horse badly, and he strayed by chance
      into this shed, of which no doubt the door was half-open,&rdquo; said the
      host, evidently taking the part of the brute-tamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just as you say,&rdquo; answered Goliath. &ldquo;I can
      remember it. I left the door ajar, that the beasts might have some air in
      the night. The cages were well shut, and there was no danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said one of the standers-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only the sight of the horse,&rdquo; added another, &ldquo;that
      made the panther furious, so as to break out of its cage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Prophet who has the most right to complain,&rdquo;
      observed a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what this or that person says,&rdquo; returned Dagobert,
      whose patience was beginning to fail him, &ldquo;I say, that I must have
      either money or a horse on the instant&mdash;yes, on the instant&mdash;for
      I wish to quit this unlucky house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say, it is you that must indemnify me,&rdquo; cried Morok,
      who had kept this stage-trick for the last, and who now exhibited his left
      hand all bloody, having hitherto concealed it beneath the sleeve of his
      pelisse. &ldquo;I shall perhaps be disabled for life,&rdquo; he added;
      &ldquo;see what a wound the panther has made here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without having the serious character that the Prophet ascribed to it, the
      wound was a pretty deep one. This last argument gained for him the general
      sympathy. Reckoning no doubt upon this incident, to secure the winning of
      a cause that he now regarded as his own, the host said to the hostler:
      &ldquo;There is only one way to make a finish. It is to call up the
      burgomaster, and beg him to step here. He will decide who is right or
      wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to propose it to you,&rdquo; said the soldier,
      &ldquo;for, after all, I cannot take the law into my own hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz, run to the burgomaster&rsquo;s!&rdquo;&mdash;and the hustler
      started in all haste. His master, fearing to be compromised by the
      examination of the soldier, whose papers he had neglected to ask for on
      his arrival, said to him: &ldquo;The burgomaster will be in a very bad
      humor, to be disturbed so late. I have no wish to suffer by it, and I must
      therefore beg you to go and fetch me your papers, to see if they are in
      rule. I ought to have made you show them, when you arrived here in the
      evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are upstairs in my knapsack; you shall have them,&rdquo;
      answered the soldier&mdash;and turning away his head, and putting his hand
      before his eyes, as he passed the dead body of Jovial, he went out to
      rejoin the sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prophet followed him with a glance of triumph, and said to himself:
      &ldquo;There he goes!&mdash;without horse, without money, without papers.
      I could not do more&mdash;for I was forbidden to do more&mdash;I was to
      act with as much cunning as possible and preserve appearances. Now every
      one will think this soldier in the wrong. I can at least answer for it,
      that he will not continue his journey for some days&mdash;since such great
      interests appear to depend on his arrest, and that of the young girls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour after this reflection of the brute-tamer, Karl,
      Goliath&rsquo;s comrade, left the hiding-place where his master had
      concealed him during the evening, and set out for Leipsic, with a letter
      which Morok had written in haste, and which Karl, on his arrival, was to
      put immediately into the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address of this letter was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Monsieur Rodin, Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, No, 11, A Paris,
      France.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. THE BURGOMASTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>agobert&rsquo;s
      anxiety increased every moment. Certain that his horse had not entered the
      shed of its own accord, he attributed the event which had taken place to
      the spite of the brute-tamer; but he sought in vain for the motive of this
      wretch&rsquo;s animosity, and he reflected with dismay, that his cause,
      however just, would depend on the good or bad humor of a judge dragged
      from his slumbers and who might be ready to condemn upon fallacious
      appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully determined to conceal, as long as possible, from the orphans the
      fresh misfortunes, which had befallen them, he was proceeding to open the
      door of their chamber, when he stumbled over Spoil-sport&mdash;for the dog
      had run back to his post, after vainly trying to prevent the Prophet from
      leading away Jovial. &ldquo;Luckily the dog has returned; the poor little
      things have been well guarded,&rdquo; said the soldier, as he opened the
      door. To his great surprise, the room was in utter darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My children,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;why are you without a light?&rdquo;
      There was no answer. In terror he groped his way to the bed, and took the
      hand of one of the sisters; the hand was cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose, my children!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Blanche! Give me some
      answer! you frighten me.&rdquo; Still the same silence continued; the hand
      which he held remained cold and powerless, and yielded passively to his
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, the moon emerged from the black clouds that surrounded her, and
      threw sufficient light into the little room, and upon the bed, which faced
      the window, for the soldier to see that the two sisters had fainted. The
      bluish light of the moon added to the paleness of the orphans; they held
      each other in a half embrace, and Rose had buried her head on Blanche&rsquo;s
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have fainted through fear,&rdquo; exclaimed Dagobert,
      running to fetch his gourd. &ldquo;Poor things! after a day of so much
      excitement, it is not surprising.&rdquo; And moistening the corner of a
      handkerchief with a few drops of brandy, the soldier knelt beside the bed,
      gently chafed the temples of the two sisters, and held the linen, wet with
      the spirituous liquor, to their little pink nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still on his knees, and bending his dark, anxious face over the orphans,
      he waited some moments before again resorting to the only restorative in
      his power. A slight shiver of Rose gave him renewed hope; the young girl
      turned her head on the pillow with a sigh; then she started, and opened
      her eyes with an expression of astonishment and alarm; but, not
      immediately recognizing Dagobert, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, sister!&rdquo;
      and threw herself into the arms of Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter also was beginning to experience the effect of the soldier&rsquo;s
      care. The exclamation of Rose completely roused her from her lethargy, and
      she clung to her sister, again sharing the fright without knowing its
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come to&mdash;that&rsquo;s the chief point,&rdquo;
      said Dagobert, &ldquo;now we shall soon get rid of these foolish fears.&rdquo;
      Then softening his voice, he added: &ldquo;Well, my children, courage? You
      are better. It is I who am here&mdash;me, Dagobert!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans made a hasty movement, and, turning towards the soldier their
      sweet faces, which were still full of dismay and agitation, they both, by
      a graceful impulse, extended their arms to him and cried: &ldquo;It is
      you, Dagobert&mdash;then we are safe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my children, it is I,&rdquo; said the veteran, taking their
      hands in his, and pressing them joyfully. &ldquo;So you have been much
      frightened during my absence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, frightened to death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew&mdash;oh, goodness! if you knew&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lamp is extinguished&mdash;why is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;recover yourselves, poor children, and tell me all about
      it. I have no good opinion of this inn; but, luckily, we shall soon leave
      it. It was an ill wind that blew me hither&mdash;though, to be sure, there
      was no other in the village. But what has happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were hardly gone, when the window flew open violently, and the
      lamp and table fell together with a loud crash.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then our courage failed&mdash;we screamed and clasped each other,
      for we thought we could hear some one moving in the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we were so frightened, that we fainted away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, persuaded that it was the violence of the wind which had
      already broken the glass, and shaken the window, Dagobert attributed this
      second accident to the same cause as the first, thinking that he had not
      properly secured the fastening and that the orphans had been deceived by a
      false alarm. &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;it is over now,&rdquo; said he to
      them: &ldquo;Calm yourselves, and don&rsquo;t think of it any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you leave us so hastily, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now I remember&mdash;did we not hear a great noise, sister,
      and see Dagobert run to the staircase, crying: &lsquo;My horse! what are
      they doing to my horse?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then Jovial who neighed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions renewed the anguish of the soldier; he feared to answer
      them, and said, with a confused air: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Jovial neighed&mdash;but
      it was nothing. By the by, we must have a light here. Do you know where I
      put my flint and steel last evening? Well, I have lost my senses; it is
      here in my pocket. Luckily, too, we have a candle, which I am going to
      light; I want to look in my knapsack for some papers I require.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert struck a few sparks, obtained a light, and saw that the window
      was indeed open, the table thrown down, and the lamp lying by the side of
      the knapsack. He shut the window, set the little table on its feet again,
      placed the knapsack upon it, and began to unbuckle this last in order to
      take out his portfolio, which had been deposited along with his cross and
      purse, in a kind of pocket between the outside and the lining. The straps
      had been readjusted with so much care, that there was no appearance of the
      knapsack having been disturbed; but when the soldier plunged his hand into
      the pocket above-mentioned, he found it empty. Struck with consternation,
      he grew pale, and retreated a step, crying: &ldquo;How is this?&mdash;Nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Blanche. He made her no answer.
      Motionless, he leaned against the table, with his hand still buried in the
      pocket. Then, yielding to a vague hope&mdash;for so cruel a reality did
      not appear possible&mdash;he hastily emptied the contents of the knapsack
      on the table&mdash;his poor half-worn clothes&mdash;his old uniform-coat
      of the horse-grenadiers of the Imperial Guard, a sacred relic for the
      soldiers&mdash;but, turn and return them as he would, he found neither his
      purse, nor the portfolio that contained his papers, the letters of General
      Simon, and his cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain, with that serious childishness which always accompanies a
      hopeless search, he took the knapsack by the two ends, and shook it
      vigorously; nothing came out. The orphans looked on with uneasiness, not
      understanding his silence or his movements, for his back was turned to
      them. Blanche ventured to say to him in a timid voice: &ldquo;What ails
      you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t answer us.&mdash;What is it you are looking for
      in your knapsack?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still mute, Dagobert searched his own person, turned out all his pockets&mdash;nothing!&mdash;For
      the first time in his life, perhaps, his two children, as he called them,
      had spoken to him without receiving a reply. Blanche and Rose felt the big
      tears start into their eyes; thinking that the soldier was angry, they
      darst not again address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! it is impossible&mdash;no!&rdquo; said the veteran,
      pressing his hand to his forehead, and seeking in his memory where he
      might have put those precious objects, the loss of which he could not yet
      bring himself to believe. A sudden beam of joy flashed from his eyes. He
      ran to a chair, and took from it the portmanteau of the orphans; it
      contained a little linen, two black dresses, and a small box of white
      wood, in which were a silk handkerchief that had belonged to their mother,
      two locks of her hair, and a black ribbon she had worn round her neck. The
      little she possessed had been seized by the Russian government, in
      pursuance of the confiscation. Dagobert searched and researched every
      article&mdash;peeped into all the corners of the portmanteau&mdash;still
      nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, completely worn out, leaning against the table, the strong,
      energetic man felt himself giving way. His face was burning, yet bathed in
      a cold sweat; his knees trembled under him. It is a common saying, that
      drowning men will catch at straws; and so it is with the despair that
      still clings to some shred of hope. Catching at a last chance&mdash;absurd,
      insane, impossible&mdash;he turned abruptly towards the orphans, and said
      to them, without considering the alteration in his voice and features:
      &ldquo;I did not give them to you&mdash;to keep for me?&mdash;speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, Rose and Blanche, terrified at his paleness and the
      expression of his countenance, uttered a cry. &ldquo;Good heavens! what is
      the matter with you?&rdquo; murmured Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got them&mdash;yes, or no?&rdquo; cried in a voice of
      thunder the unfortunate, distracted man. &ldquo;If you have not&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      take the first knife I meet with, and stick it into my body!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! You are so good: pardon us if we have done anything to
      afflict you! You love us so much, you would not do us any harm.&rdquo; The
      orphans began to weep, as they stretched forth their hands in supplication
      towards the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at them with haggard eye, without even seeing them; till, as the
      delusion passed away, the reality presented itself to his mind with all
      its terrible consequences. Then he clasped his hands together, fell on his
      knees before the bed of the orphans, leaned his forehead upon it, and amid
      his convulsive sobs&mdash;for the man of iron sobbed like a child&mdash;these
      broken words were audible: &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;forgive!&mdash;I do not
      know how it can be!&mdash;Oh! what a misfortune!&mdash;what a misfortune!&mdash;Forgive
      me!&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      At this outbreak of grief, the cause of which they understood not, but
      which in such a man was heart-rending, the two sisters wound their arms
      about his old gray head, and exclaimed amid their tears: &ldquo;Look at
      us! Only tell us what is the matter with you?&mdash;Is it our fault?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, the noise of footsteps resounded from the stairs, mingled
      with the barking of Spoil-sport, who had remained outside the door. The
      nearer the steps approached, the more furious became the barking; it was
      no doubt accompanied with hostile demonstrations, for the host was heard
      to cry out in an angry tone: &ldquo;Hollo! you there! Call off your dog,
      or speak to him. It is Mr. Burgomaster who is coming up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;it is the burgomaster,&rdquo;
      said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming upstairs&mdash;a number of people,&rdquo; resumed
      Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word burgomaster recalled whatever had happened to the mind of
      Dagobert, and completed, so to express it, the picture of his terrible
      position. His horse was dead, he had neither papers nor money, and a day,
      a single day&rsquo;s detention, might defeat the last hope of the sisters,
      and render useless this long and toilsome journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of strong minds, and the veteran was of the number, prefer great
      perils, positions of danger accurately defined, to the vague anxieties
      which precede a settled misfortune. Guided by his good sense and admirable
      devotion, Dagobert understood at once, that his only resource was now in
      the justice of the burgomaster, and that all his efforts should tend to
      conciliate the favor of that magistrate. He therefore dried his eyes with
      the sheet, rose from the ground, erect, calm, and resolute, and said to
      the orphans: &ldquo;Fear nothing, my children; it is our deliverer who is
      at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you call off your dog or no?&rdquo; cried the host, still
      detained on the stairs by Spoil-sport, who, as a vigilant sentinel,
      continued to dispute the passage. &ldquo;Is the animal mad, I say? Why don&rsquo;t
      you tie him up? Have you not caused trouble enough in my house? I tell
      you, that Mr. Burgomaster is waiting to examine you in your turn, for he
      has finished with Morok.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert drew his fingers through his gray locks and across his moustache,
      clasped the collar of his top-coat, and brushed the sleeves with his hand,
      in order to give himself the best appearance possible; for he felt that
      the fate of the orphans must depend on his interview with the magistrate.
      It was not without a violent beating of the heart, that he laid his hand
      upon the door-knob, saying to the young girls, who were growing more and
      more frightened by such a succession of events: &ldquo;Hide yourselves in
      your bed, my children; if any one must needs enter, it shall be the
      burgomaster alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, opening the door, the soldier stepped out on the landing place,
      and said: &ldquo;Down, Spoil-sport!&mdash;Here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog obeyed, but with manifest repugnance. His master had to speak
      twice, before he would abstain from all hostile movements towards the
      host. This latter, with a lantern in one hand and his cap in the other,
      respectfully preceded the burgomaster, whose magisterial proportions were
      lost in the half shadows of the staircase. Behind the judge, and a few
      steps lower, the inquisitive faces of the people belonging to the inn were
      dimly visible by the light of another lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, having turned the dog into the room, shut the door after him,
      and advanced two steps on the landing-place, which was sufficiently
      spacious to hold several persons, and had in one corner a wooden bench
      with a back to it. The burgomaster, as he ascended the last stair, was
      surprised to see Dagobert close the door of the chamber, as though he
      wished to forbid his entrance. &ldquo;Why do you shut that door?&rdquo;
      asked he in an abrupt tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, because two girls, whom I have the charge of, are in bed in
      that room; secondly, because your examination would alarm them,&rdquo;
      replied Dagobert. &ldquo;Sit down upon this bench, Mr. Burgomaster, and
      examine me here; it will not make any difference, I should think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what right,&rdquo; asked the judge, with a displeased air,
      &ldquo;do you pretend to dictate to me the place of your examination?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have no such pretension, Mr. Burgomaster!&rdquo; said the
      soldier hastily, fearing above all things to prejudice the judge against
      him: &ldquo;only, as the girls are in bed, and already much frightened, it
      would be a proof of your good heart to examine me where I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the magistrate, with ill-humor; &ldquo;a pretty
      state of things, truly!&mdash;It was much worth while to disturb me in the
      middle of the night. But, come, so be it; I will examine you here.&rdquo;
      Then, turning to the landlord, he added: &ldquo;Put your lantern upon this
      bench, and leave us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper obeyed, and went down, followed by his people, as
      dissatisfied as they were at being excluded from the examination. The
      veteran was left alone with the magistrate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE JUDGEMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he worthy
      burgomaster of Mockern wore a cloth cap, and was enveloped in a cloak. He
      sat down heavily on the bench. He was a corpulent man, about sixty, with
      an arrogant, morose countenance; and he frequently rubbed with his red,
      fat fist, eyes that were still swollen and blood shot, from his having
      been suddenly roused from sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert stood bareheaded before him, with a submissive, respectful air,
      holding his old foraging cap in his hands, and trying to read in the
      sullen physiognomy of his judge what chance there might be to interest him
      in his favor&mdash;that is, in favor of the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this critical juncture, the poor soldier summoned to his aid all his
      presence of mind, reason, eloquence and resolution. He, who had twenty
      times braved death with the utmost coolness&mdash;who, calm and serene,
      because sincere and tried, had never quailed before the eagle-glance of
      the Emperor, his hero and idol&mdash;now felt himself disconcerted and
      trembling before the ill-humored face of a village burgomaster. Even so, a
      few hours before, he had submitted, impassive and resigned, to the insults
      of the Prophet&mdash;that he might not compromise the sacred mission with
      which a dying mother had entrusted him&mdash;thus showing to what a height
      of heroic abnegation it is possible for a simple and honest heart to
      attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say in your justification? Come, be quick!&rdquo;
      said the judge roughly, with a yawn of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not got to justify myself&mdash;I have to make a complaint,
      Mr. Burgomaster,&rdquo; replied Dagobert in a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you are to teach me in what terms I am to put my
      questions?&rdquo; exclaimed the magistrate, in so sharp a tone that the
      soldier reproached himself with having begun the interview so badly.
      Wishing to pacify his judge, he made haste to answer with submission:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Burgomaster, I have ill-explained my meaning. I only
      wished to say that I was not wrong in this affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prophet says the contrary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prophet?&rdquo; repeated the soldier, with an air of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prophet is a pious and honest man,&rdquo; resumed the judge,
      &ldquo;incapable of falsehood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say anything upon that subject; but you are too just, and
      have too good a heart, Mr. Burgomaster, to condemn without hearing me. It
      is not a man like you that would do an injustice; oh, one can see that at
      a glance!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In resigning himself thus to play the part of a courtier, Dagobert
      softened as much as possible his gruff voice, and strove to give to his
      austere countenance a smiling, agreeable, and flattering expression.
      &ldquo;A man like you,&rdquo; he added, with redoubled suavity of manner,
      &ldquo;a respectable judge like you, never shuts his ears to one side or
      the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ears are not in question, but eyes; and, though mine smart as if I
      had rubbed them with nettles, I have seen the hand of the brute-tamer,
      with a frightful wound on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Burgomaster, it is very true; but consider, if he had shut
      his cages and his door, all this would not have happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; it is your fault. You should have fastened your horse
      securely to the manger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Burgomaster, certainly, you are right,&rdquo;
      said the soldier, in a still more affable and conciliating voice. &ldquo;It
      is not for a poor devil like me to contradict you. But supposing my horse
      was let loose out of pure malice, in order that he might stray into the
      menagerie&mdash;you will then acknowledge that it was not my fault. That
      is, you will acknowledge it if you think fit,&rdquo; hastily added the
      soldier &ldquo;I have no right to dictate to you in anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why the devil should any one do you this ill-turn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Mr. Burgomaster&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know&mdash;well, nor I either,&rdquo; said the
      burgomaster impatiently. &ldquo;Zounds! what a many words about the
      carcass of an old horse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of the soldier, losing on a sudden its expression of
      forced suavity, became once more severe; he answered in a grave voice,
      full of emotion: &ldquo;My horse is dead&mdash;he is no more than a
      carcass&mdash;that is true; but an hour ago, though very old, he was full
      of life and intelligence. He neighed joyously at my voice&mdash;and, every
      evening, he licked the hands of the two poor children, whom he had carried
      all the day&mdash;as formerly he had carried their mother. Now he will
      never carry any one again; they will throw him to the dogs, and all will
      be finished. You need not have reminded me harshly of it, Mr. Burgomaster&mdash;for
      I loved my horse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By these words, pronounced with noble and touching simplicity, the
      burgomaster was moved in spite of himself, and regretted his hasty speech.
      &ldquo;It is natural that you should be sorry for your horse,&rdquo; said
      he, in a less impatient tone; &ldquo;but what is to be done?&mdash;It is a
      misfortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A misfortune?&mdash;Yes, Mr. Burgomaster, a very great misfortune.
      The girls, who accompany me, were too weak to undertake a long journey on
      foot, too poor to travel in a carriage&mdash;and yet we have to arrive in
      Paris before the month of February. When their mother died, I promised her
      to take them to France, for these children have only me to take care of
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are then their&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am their faithful servant, Mr. Burgomaster; and now that my horse
      has been killed, what can I do for them? Come, you are good, you have
      perhaps children of your own; if, one day, they should find themselves in
      the position of my two little orphans&mdash;with no wealth, no resources
      in the world, but an old soldier who loves them, and an old horse to carry
      them along&mdash;if, after being very unfortunate from their birth&mdash;yes,
      very unfortunate, for my orphans are the daughters of exiles&mdash;they
      should see happiness before them at the end of a journey, and then, by the
      death of their horse, that journey become impossible&mdash;tell me, Mr.
      Burgomaster, if this would not touch your heart? Would you not find, as I
      do, that the loss of my horse is irreparable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered the burgomaster, who was not ill natured
      at bottom, and who could not help taking part in Dagobert&rsquo;s emotion;
      &ldquo;I now understand the importance of the loss you have suffered. And
      then your orphans interest me: how old are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen years and two months. They are twins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen years and two months&mdash;that is about the age of my
      Frederica.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a young lady of that age?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, once more
      awaking to hope; &ldquo;ah, Mr. Burgomaster! I am really no longer uneasy
      about my poor children. You will do us justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do justice is my duty. After all, in this affair, the faults are
      about equal on both sides. You tied up your horse badly, and the brute
      tamer left his door open. He says: &lsquo;I am wounded in the hand.&rsquo;
      You answer: &lsquo;My horse has been killed&mdash;and, for a thousand
      reasons, the loss of my horse is irreparable.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me speak better than I could ever speak on my own account,
      Mr. Burgomaster,&rdquo; said the soldier, with a humble, insinuating
      smile; &ldquo;but &lsquo;tis what I meant to express&mdash;and, as you say
      yourself, Mr. Burgomaster, my horse being my whole fortune, it is only
      fair&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; resumed the magistrate, interrupting the
      soldier; &ldquo;your reasons are excellent. The Prophet&mdash;who is a
      good and pious man with all has related the facts to me in his own way;
      and then, you see, he is an old acquaintance. We are nearly all zealous
      Catholics here, and he sells to our wives such cheap and edifying little
      books, with chaplets and amulets of the best manufacture, at less than the
      prime cost. All this, you will say, has nothing to do with the affair; and
      you will be right in saying so: still I must needs confess that I came
      here with the intention&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of deciding against me, eh, Mr. Burgomaster?&rdquo; said Dagobert,
      gaining more and more confidence. &ldquo;You see, you were not quite
      awake, and your justice had only one eye open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, master soldier,&rdquo; answered the judge with good humor,
      &ldquo;it is not unlikely; for I did not conceal from Morok that I gave it
      in his favor. Then he said to me (very generously, by the way): &lsquo;Since
      you condemn my adversary, I will not aggravate his position by telling you
      certain things&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! against me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently so; but, like a generous enemy, when I told him that I
      should most likely condemn you to pay him damages, he said no more about
      it. For I will not hide from you, that, before I heard your reasons, I
      fully intended that you should make compensation for the Prophet&rsquo;s
      wound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Mr. Burgomaster, how the most just and able persons are
      subject to be deceived,&rdquo; said Dagobert, becoming once more the
      courtier; then, trying to assume a prodigiously knowing look, he added:
      &ldquo;But such persons find out the truth at last, and are not to be made
      dupes of, whatever prophets may say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This poor attempt at a jest&mdash;the first and only one, perhaps, that
      Dagobert had ever been guilty of&mdash;will show the extremity to which he
      was reduced, and the desperate efforts of all kinds he was making to
      conciliate the good graces of his judge. The burgomaster did not at first
      see the pleasantry; he was only led to perceive it by the self satisfied
      mien of Dagobert, and by his inquiring glance, which seemed to say:
      &ldquo;Is it not good, eh?&mdash;I am astonished at it myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate began, therefore, to smile with a patronizing air, and,
      nodding his head, replied in the same jocular spirit: &ldquo;Ha! Ha! Ha!
      You are right; the Prophet is out in his prophecy. You shall not pay him
      any damages. The faults on both sides are equal, and the injuries balance
      one another. He has been wounded, your horse has been killed; so you may
      cry quits, and have done with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how much then, do you think he owes me?&rdquo; asked the
      soldier, with singular simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Burgomaster, what sum will he have to pay me? Yes&mdash;but,
      before you decide, I must tell you one thing, Mr. Burgomaster. I think I
      shall be entitled to spend only part of the money in buying a horse. I am
      sure, that, in the environs of Leipsic, I could get a beast very cheap
      from some of the peasants; and, between ourselves, I will own to you,
      that, if I could meet with only a nice little donkey&mdash;I should not be
      over particular&mdash;I should even like it just as well; for, after my
      poor Jovial, the company of another horse would be painful to me. I must
      also tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey-day!&rdquo; cried the burgomaster, interrupting Dagobert,
      &ldquo;of what money, what donkey, and what other horse are you talking? I
      tell you, that you owe nothing to the Prophet, and that he owes you
      nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He owes me nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very dull of comprehension, my good man. I repeat, that, if
      the Prophet&rsquo;s animals have killed your horse, the Prophet himself
      has been badly wounded; so you may cry quits. In other words, you owe him
      nothing, and he owes you nothing. Now do you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, confounded, remained for some moments without answering, whilst
      he looked at the burgomaster with an expression of deep anguish. He saw
      that his judgment would again destroy all his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Burgomaster,&rdquo; resumed he, in an agitated voice,
      &ldquo;you are too just not to pay attention to one thing: the wound of
      the brute-tamer does not prevent him from continuing his trade; the death
      of my horse prevents me from continuing my journey; therefore, he ought to
      indemnify me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge considered he had already done a good deal for Dagobert, in not
      making him responsible for the wound of the Prophet, who, as we have
      already said, exercised a certain influence over the Catholics of the
      country by the sale of his devotional treasures, and also from its being
      known that he was supported by some persons of eminence. The soldier&rsquo;s
      pertinacity, therefore, offended the magistrate, who, reassuming his lofty
      air, replied, in a chilling tone: &ldquo;You will make me repent my
      impartiality. How is this? Instead of thanking me, you ask for more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Burgomaster, I ask only for what is just. I wish I were
      wounded in the hand, like the Prophet, so that I could but continue my
      journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not talking of what you wish. I have pronounced sentence&mdash;there
      is no more to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Burgomaster&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, enough. Let us go to the next subject. Your papers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we will speak about my papers; but I beg of you, Mr.
      Burgomaster, to have pity on those two children. Let us have the means to
      continue our journey, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done all I could for you&mdash;perhaps, more than I ought.
      Once again, your papers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must first explain to you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No explanation&mdash;your papers!&mdash;Or would you like me to
      have you arrested as a vagabond?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me&mdash;-arrested!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that, if you refuse to show me your papers, it will be
      as if you had none. Now, those people who have no papers we take into
      custody till the authorities can dispose of them. Let me see your papers,
      and make haste!&mdash;I am in a hurry to get home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert&rsquo;s position was the more distressing, as for a moment he had
      indulged in sanguine hope. The last blow was now added to all the veteran
      had suffered since the commencement of this scene, which was a cruel as
      well as dangerous trial, for a man of his character&mdash;upright, but
      obstinate&mdash;faithful, but rough and absolute&mdash;a man who, for a
      long time a soldier, and a victorious one, had acquired a certain despotic
      mariner of treating with civilians.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words&mdash;&ldquo;your papers,&rdquo; Dagobert became very pale;
      but he tried to conceal his anguish beneath an air of assurance, which he
      thought best calculated to gain the magistrate&rsquo;s good opinion.
      &ldquo;I will tell you all about it, Mr. Burgomaster,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Nothing can be clearer. Such a thing might happen to any one. I do
      not look like a beggar and a vagabond, do I? And yet&mdash;you will
      understand, that an honest man who travels with two young girls&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more words! Your papers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture two powerful auxiliaries arrived to the soldier&rsquo;s
      aid. The orphans, growing more and more uneasy, and hearing Dagobert still
      talking upon the landing-place, had risen and dressed themselves; so that
      just at the instant, when the magistrate said in a rough voice&mdash;&ldquo;No
      more words! Your papers!&rdquo;&mdash;Rose and Blanche holding each other
      by the hand, came forth from the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of those charming faces, which their poor mourning vestments only
      rendered more interesting, the burgomaster rose from his seat, struck with
      surprise and admiration. By a spontaneous movement, each sister took a
      hand of Dagobert, and pressed close to him, whilst they regarded the
      magistrate with looks of mingled anxiety and candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so touching a picture, this of the old soldier presenting as it
      were to his judge the graceful children, with countenances full of
      innocence and beauty, that the burgomaster, by a sudden reaction, found
      himself once more disposed to sentiments of pity. Dagobert perceived it;
      and, still holding the orphans by the hand, he advanced towards him, and
      said in a feeling voice: &ldquo;Look at these poor children, Mr.
      Burgomaster! Could I show you a better passport?&rdquo; And, overcome by
      so many painful sensations&mdash;restrained, yet following each other in
      quick succession&mdash;Dagobert felt, in spite of himself, that the tears
      were starting to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though naturally rough, and rendered still more testy by the interruption
      of his sleep, the burgomaster was not quite deficient in sense of feeling.
      He perceived at once, that a man thus accompanied, ought not to inspire
      any great distrust. &ldquo;Poor dear children!&rdquo; said he, as he
      examined them with growing interest; &ldquo;orphans so young, and they
      come from far&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the heart of Siberia, Mr. Burgomaster, where their mother was
      an exile before their birth. It is now more than five months that we have
      been travelling on by short stages&mdash;hard enough, you will say, for
      children of their age. It is for them that I ask your favor and support
      for them against whom everything seems to combine to-day for, only just
      now, when I went to look for my papers, I could not find in my knapsack
      the portfolio in which they were, along with my purse and cross&mdash;for
      you must know, Mr. Burgomaster&mdash;pardon me, if I say it&mdash;&lsquo;tis
      not from vain glory&mdash;but I was decorated by the hand of the Emperor;
      and a man whom he decorated with his own hand, you see, could not be so
      bad a fellow, though he may have had the misfortune to lose his papers&mdash;and
      his purse. That&rsquo;s what has happened to me, and made me so pressing
      about the damages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How and where did you suffer this loss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Mr. Burgomaster; I am sure that the evening before
      last, at bed-time, I took a little money out of the purse, and saw the
      portfolio in its place; yesterday I had small change sufficient, and did
      not undo the knapsack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where then has the knapsack been kept?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the room occupied by the children: but this night&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert was here interrupted by the tread of some one mounting the
      stairs: it was the Prophet. Concealed in the shadow of the staircase, he
      had listened to this conversation, and he dreaded lest the weakness of the
      burgomaster should mar the complete success of his projects.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE DECISION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>orok, who wore his
      left arm in a sling, having slowly ascended the staircase, saluted the
      burgomaster respectfully. At sight of the repulsive countenance of the
      lion-tamer, Rose and Blanche, affrighted, drew back a step nearer to the
      soldier. The brow of the latter grew dark, for he felt his blood boil
      against Morok, the cause of all his difficulties&mdash;though he was yet
      ignorant that Goliath, at the instigation of the Prophet, had stolen his
      portfolio and papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want, Morok?&rdquo; said the burgomaster, with an air
      half friendly and half displeased. &ldquo;I told the landlord that I did
      not wish to be interrupted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to render you a service, Mr. Burgomaster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A service?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a great service; or I should not have ventured to disturb you.
      My conscience reproaches me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your conscience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Burgomaster, it reproaches me for not having told you all
      that I had to tell about this man; a false pity led me astray.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yell, but what have you to tell?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok approached the judge, and spoke to him for sometime in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first apparently much astonished, the burgomaster became by degrees
      deeply attentive and anxious; every now and then be allowed some
      exclamation of surprise or doubt to escape him, whilst he glanced covertly
      at the group formed by Dagobert and the two young girls. By the expression
      of his countenance, which grew every moment more unquiet, severe, and
      searching, it was easy to perceive that the interest which the magistrate
      had felt for the orphans and for the soldier, was gradually changed, by
      the secret communications of the Prophet, into a sentiment of distrust and
      hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert saw this sudden revolution, and his fears, which had been
      appeased for an instant, returned with redoubled force; Rose and Blanche,
      confused, and not understanding the object of this mute scene, looked at
      the soldier with increased perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said the burgomaster, rising abruptly; &ldquo;all
      of this never occurred to me. What could I have been thinking of?&mdash;But
      you see, Morok, when one is roused up in the middle of the night, one has
      not always presence of mind. You said well: it is a great service you came
      to render me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assert nothing positively, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; &lsquo;tis a thousand to one that you are right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only a suspicion founded upon divers circumstances; but even
      a suspicion&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May give you scent of the truth. And here was I, going like a gull
      into the snare!&mdash;Once more, what could I have been thinking of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so difficult to be on guard against certain appearances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not tell me so, my dear Morok, you need not tell me so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this mysterious conversation, Dagobert was on thorns; he saw
      vaguely that a violent storm was about to burst. He thought only of how he
      should still keep his anger within bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok again approached the judge, and glancing at the orphans, recommenced
      speaking in a low voice. &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; cried the burgomaster, with,
      indignation, &ldquo;you go too far now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I affirm nothing,&rdquo; said Morok, hastily; &ldquo;it is a mere
      supposition founded on&mdash;&rdquo; and he again brought his lips close
      to the ear of the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, why not?&rdquo; resumed the magistrate, lifting up his
      hands; &ldquo;such people are capable of anything. He says that he brings
      them from the heart of Siberia: why may not all this prove to be a tissue
      of impudent falsehoods?&mdash;But I am not to be made a dupe twice,&rdquo;
      cried the burgomaster, in an angry tone, for, like all persons of a weak
      and shifting character, he was without pity for those whom he thought
      capable of having beguiled his compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be in a hurry to decide&mdash;don&rsquo;t give to my words
      more weight than they deserve,&rdquo; resumed Morok with a hypocritical
      affectation of humility. &ldquo;I am unhappily placed in so false a
      position with regard to this man,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to Dagober&mdash;&ldquo;that
      I might be thought to have acted from private resentment for the injury he
      has done me; perhaps I may so act without knowing it, while I fancy that I
      am only influenced by love of justice, horror of falsehood, and respect
      for our holy religion. Well&mdash;who lives long enough will know&mdash;and
      may heaven forgive me if I am deceived!&mdash;In any case, the law will
      pronounce upon it; and if they should prove innocent, they will be
      released in a month or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, for that reason, I need not hesitate. It is a mere measure of
      precaution; they will not die of it. Besides, the more I think of it, the
      more it seems probable. Yes this man is doubtless a French spy or
      agitator, especially when I compare these suspicions with the late
      demonstration of the students at Frankfort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, upon that theory, nothing is better fitted to excite and stir
      up those hot-headed youths than&mdash;&rdquo; He glanced significantly at
      the two sisters; then, after a pause, he added with a sigh, &ldquo;Satan
      does not care by what means he works out his ends!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, it would be odious, but well-devised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, Mr Burgomaster, look at him attentively: you will see
      that this man has a dangerous face. You will see&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In continuing thus to speak in a low tone, Morok had evidently pointed to
      Dagobert. The latter, notwithstanding his self-command, felt that the
      restraint he had imposed upon himself, since his arrival at this unlucky
      inn, and above all wince the commencement of the conversation between
      Morok and the burgomaster, was becoming no longer bearable; besides, he
      saw clearly that all his efforts to conciliate the favor of the judge were
      rendered completely null by the fatal influence of the brute-tamer; so,
      losing patience, he advanced towards him with his arms folded on his
      breast, and said to him in a subdued voice: &ldquo;Was it of me that you
      were whispering to Mr. Burgomaster?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morok, looking fixedly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not speak out loud?&rdquo; Having said this, the almost
      convulsive movement of his thick moustache, as he stood looping Morok full
      in the face, gave evidence of a severe internal conflict. Seeing that his
      adversary preserved a contemptuous silence, he repeated in a sterner
      voice: &ldquo;I ask you, why you did not speak out loud to Mr.
      Burgomaster, when you were talking of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there are some things so shameful, that one would blush to
      utter them aloud,&rdquo; answered Morok insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till then Dagobert had kept his arms folded; he now extended them
      violently, clenching his fists. This sudden movement was so expressive
      that the two sisters uttered a cry of terror, and drew closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark ye, Mr. Burgomaster!&rdquo; said the soldier, grinding his
      teeth with rage: &ldquo;bid that man go down, or I will not answer for
      myself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the burgomaster, haughtily; &ldquo;do you dare to
      give orders to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you to make that man go down,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, quite
      beside himself, &ldquo;or there will be mischief!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert!&mdash;good heaven!&mdash;be calm,&rdquo; cried the
      children, grasping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It becomes you, certainly&mdash;miserable vagabond that you are&mdash;not
      to say worse,&rdquo; returned the burgomaster, in a rage: &ldquo;it
      becomes you to give orders to me!&mdash;Oh! you think to impose upon me,
      by telling me you have lost your papers!&mdash;It will not serve your
      turn, for which you carry about with you these two girls, who, in spite of
      their innocent looks, are perhaps after all&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, with so terrible a voice and gesture
      that the official did not dare to finish. Taking the children by the arm
      before they could speak a word, the soldier pushed them back into the
      chamber; then, locking the door, and putting the key into his pocket, he
      returned precipitately towards the burgomaster, who, frightened at the
      menacing air and attitude of the veteran, retreated a couple of steps, and
      held by one hand to the rail of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo; said the soldier, seizing the judge by the
      arm. &ldquo;Just now, that scoundrel insulted me&mdash;I bore with it&mdash;for
      it only concerned myself. I have heard patiently all your idle talk,
      because you seemed for a moment to interest yourself in those poor
      children. But since you have neither soul, nor pity, nor justice&mdash;I
      tell you that, burgomaster though you are&mdash;I will spurn you as I
      would spurn that dog,&rdquo; pointing again to the Prophet, &ldquo;if you
      have the misfortune to mention those two young girls, in any other way
      than you would speak of your own child!&mdash;Now, do you mark me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&mdash;you dare to say,&rdquo; cried the burgomaster,
      stammering with rage, &ldquo;that if I happen to mention two adventuresses&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hats off!&mdash;when you speak of the daughters of the Duke of
      Ligny,&rdquo; cried the soldier, snatching the cap of the burgomaster and
      flinging it on the ground. On this act of aggression, Morok could not
      restrain his joy. Exasperated and losing all hope, Dagobert had at length
      yielded to the violence of his anger, after struggling so painfully
      against it for some hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the burgomaster saw his cap at his feet, he looked at the brute tamer
      with an air of stupefaction, as if he hesitated to believe so great an
      enormity. Dagobert, regretting, his violence, and feeling that no means of
      conciliation note remained, threw a rapid glance around him, and,
      retreating several paces, gained the topmost steps of the staircase. The
      burgomaster stood near the bench, in a corner of the landing-place, whilst
      Morok, with his arm in the sling, to give the more serious appearance to
      his wound, was close beside him. &ldquo;So!&rdquo; cried the magistrate,
      deceived by the backward movement of Dagobert, &ldquo;you think to escape,
      after daring to lift hand against me!&mdash;Old villain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Mr. Burgomaster! It was a burst of rashness that I was
      not able to control. I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said Dagobert in a
      repentant voice, and hanging his head humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No pity for thee, rascal! You would begin again to smooth me over
      with your coaxing ways, but I have penetrated your secret designs. You are
      not what you appear to be, and there is perhaps an affair of state at the
      bottom of all this,&rdquo; added the magistrate, in a very diplomatic
      tone. &ldquo;All means are alike to those who wish to set Europe in
      flames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only a poor devil, Mr. Burgomaster; you, that have a good
      heart, will show me some mercy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when you have pulled off my cap?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; added the soldier, turning towards Morok, &ldquo;you,
      that have been the cause of all this&mdash;have same pity upon me&mdash;do
      not bear malice!&mdash;You, a holy man, speak a word in my favor to Mr.
      Burgomaster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken to him what I was bound to speak,&rdquo; answered the
      Prophet ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! you can look foolish enough now, you old vagabond! Did you
      think to impose on me with lamentations?&rdquo; resumed the burgomaster,
      advancing towards Dagobert. &ldquo;Thanks be, I am no longer your dupe!&mdash;You
      shall see that we have good dungeons at Leipsic for French agitators and
      female vagrants, for your damsels are no better than you are. Come,&rdquo;
      added he, puffing out his cheeks with an important air, &ldquo;go down
      before me&mdash;and as for you, Morok&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The burgomaster was unable to finish. For some minutes Dagobert had only
      sought to gain time, and had cast many a side-glance at a half-open door
      on the landing-place, just opposite to the chamber occupied by the
      orphans: finding the moment favorable, he now rushed quick as lightning on
      the burgomaster, seized him by the throat, and dashed him with such
      violence against the door in question, that the magistrate, stupefied by
      this sudden attack, and unable to speak a word or utter a cry, rolled over
      to the further end of the room, which was completely dark. Then, turning
      towards Morok, who, with his arm encumbered by the sling, made a rush for
      the staircase, the soldier caught him by his long, streaming hair, pulled
      him back, clasped him with hands of iron, clapped his hand over his mouth
      to stifle his outcries, and notwithstanding his desperate resistance,
      dragged him into the chamber, on the floor of which the burgomaster lay
      bruised and stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having double-locked the door, and put the key in his pocket, Dagobert
      descended the stairs at two bounds, and found himself in a passage, that
      opened on the court-yard. The gate of the inn was shut, and there was no
      possibility of escape on that side. The rain fell in torrents. He could
      see through the window of a parlor, in which a fire was burning, the host
      and his people waiting for the decision of the burgomaster. To bolt the
      door of the passage, and thus intercept all communication with the yard,
      was for the soldier the affair of an instant, and he hastened upstairs
      again to rejoin the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok, recovering from his surprise, was calling for help with all his
      might; but, even if the distance had permitted him to be heard, the noise
      of the wind and rain would have drowned his outcries. Dagobert had about
      an hour before him, for it would require some time to elapse before the
      length of his interview with the magistrate would excite astonishment;
      and, suspicion or fear once awakened, it would be necessary to break open
      two doors&mdash;that which separated the passage from the court-yard, and
      that of the room in which the burgomaster and the Prophet were confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My children, it is now time to prove that you have a soldier&rsquo;s
      blood in your veins,&rdquo; said Dagobert, as he entered abruptly the
      chamber of the young girls, who were terrified at the racket they had
      heard for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, Dagobert! what has happened?&rdquo; cried Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish us to do?&rdquo; added Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering, the soldier ran to the bed, tore off the sheets, tied
      them strongly together, made a knot at one end, passed it over the top of
      the left half of the casement, and so shut it in. Thus made fast by the
      size of the knot, which could not slip through, the sheets, floating on
      the outside, touched the ground. The second half of the window was left
      open, to afford a passage to the fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran next took his knapsack, the children&rsquo;s portmanteau, and
      the reindeer pelisse, and threw them all out of the window, making a sign
      to Spoil-sport to follow, to watch over them. The dog did not hesitate,
      but disappeared at a single bound. Rose and Blanche looked at Dagobert in
      amazement, without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; said he to them, &ldquo;the doors of the inn
      are shut, and it is by this way,&rdquo; pointing to the window, &ldquo;that
      we must pass&mdash;if we would not be arrested, put in prison&mdash;you in
      one place, and I in the other&mdash;and have our journey altogether
      knocked on the head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrested! put in prison!&rdquo; cried Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Separated from you!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my poor children!&mdash;They have killed Jovial&mdash;we must
      make our escape on foot, and try to reach Leipsic&mdash;when you are
      tired, I will carry you, and, though I have to beg my way, we will go
      through with it. But a quarter of an hour later, and all will be lost.
      Come, children, have trust in me&mdash;show that the daughters of General
      Simon are no cowards&mdash;and there is yet hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By a sympathetic movement, the sisters joined hands, as though they would
      meet the danger united. Their sweet faces, pale from the effect of so many
      painful emotions, were now expressive of simple resolve, founded on the
      blind faith they reposed in the devotion of the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, Dagobert! we&rsquo;ll not be frightened,&rdquo; said
      Rose, in a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do what must be done,&rdquo; added Blanche, in a no less
      resolute tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it,&rdquo; cried Dagobert; &ldquo;good blood is ever
      thicker than water. Come! you are light as feathers, the sheet is strong,
      it is hardly eight feet to the ground, and the pup is waiting for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for me to go first&mdash;I am the eldest for to-day,&rdquo;
      cried Rose, when she had tenderly embraced Blanche; and she ran to the
      window, in order, if there were any danger, to expose herself to it before
      her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert easily guessed the cause of this eagerness. &ldquo;Dear children!&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;I understand you. But fear nothing for one another&mdash;there
      is no danger. I have myself fastened the sheet. Quick, my little Rose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As light as a bird, the young girl mounted the ledge of the window, and
      assisted by Dagobert, took hold of the sheet, and slid gently down
      according to the recommendation of the soldier, who, leaning out his whole
      body, encouraged her with his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, sister!&rdquo; said she, as soon as she
      touched the ground, &ldquo;it is very easy to come down this way. And
      Spoil-sport is here, licking my hands.&rdquo; Blanche did not long keep
      her waiting; as courageous as her sister, she descended with the same
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear little creatures! what have they done to be so unfortunate?&mdash;Thousand
      thunders! there must be a curse upon the family,&rdquo; cried Dagobert,
      as, with heavy heart, he saw the pale, sweet face of the young girl
      disappear amid the gloom of the dark night, which violent squalls of wind
      and torrents of rain rendered still more dismal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert, we are waiting for you; come quickly!&rdquo; said the
      orphans in a low voice, from beneath the window. Thanks to his tall
      stature, the soldier rather leaped than glided to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert and the two young girls had not fled from the inn of the White
      Falcon more than a quarter of an hour, when a long crash resounded through
      the house. The door had yielded to the efforts of the burgomaster and
      Morok, who had made use of a heavy table as a battering ram. Guided by the
      light, they ran to the chamber of the orphans, now deserted. Morok saw the
      sheets floating from the casement, and cried: &ldquo;Mr. Burgomaster, they
      have escaped by the window&mdash;they are on foot&mdash;in this dark and
      stormy night, they cannot be far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, we shall catch them, the miserable tramps! Oh, I will be
      revenged! Quick, Morok; your honor is concerned as well as mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My honor?&mdash;Much more is concerned than that, Mr. Burgomaster,&rdquo;
      answered the Prophet, in a tone of great irritation. Then, rapidly
      descending the stairs, he opened the door of the court-yard, and shouted
      in a voice of thunder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goliath! unchain the dogs!&mdash;and, landlord! bring us lanterns,
      torches&mdash;arm your people&mdash;open the doors!&mdash;We must pursue
      the fugitives; they cannot escape us; we must have them&mdash;alive or
      dead!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV. THE DESPATCHES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen we read, in
      the rules of the order of the Jesuits, under the title De formula
      scribendi (Institut. 2, 11, p. 125, 129), the development of the 8th part
      of the constitutions, we are appalled by the number of letters,
      narratives, registers, and writings of all kinds, preserved in the
      archives of the society.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a police infinitely more exact and better informed than has ever
      been that of any state. Even the government of Venice found itself
      surpassed by the Jesuits: when it drove them out in 1606, it seized all
      their papers, and reproached them for their great and laborious curiosity.
      This police, this secret inquisition, carried to such a degree of
      perfection, may give some idea of the strength of a government, so
      well-informed so persevering in its projects, so powerful by its unity,
      and, as the constitutions have it, by the union of its members. It is not
      hard to understand, what immense force must belong to the heads of this
      society, and how the general of the Jesuits could say to the Duke de
      Brissac: &ldquo;From this room, your grace, I govern not only Paris, but
      China&mdash;not only China, but the whole world&mdash;and all without any
      one knowing how it is done:&rdquo; (Constitution of the Jesuits, edited by
      Paulin, Paris, 1843.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok, the lion-tamer, seeing Dagobert deprived of his horse, and stripped
      of his money and papers, and thinking it was thus out of his power to
      continue his journey, had, previous to the arrival of the burgomaster,
      despatched Karl to Leipsic, as the bearer of a letter which he was to put
      immediately into the post. The address of this letter was as follows:
      &ldquo;A Monsieur Rodin, Rue du Milieu des Ursins, Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of this obscure and solitary street, situate below the
      level of the Quai Napoleon, which it joins not far from the Rue Saint
      Landry, there stood a house of unpretentious appearance, at the bottom of
      a dark and narrow court-yard, separated from the street by a low building
      in front, with arched doorway, and two windows protected by thick iron
      bars. Nothing could be more simple than the interior of this quiet
      dwelling, as was sufficiently shown by the furniture of a pretty large
      room on the ground floor. The walls of this apartment were lined with old
      gray wainscot; the tiled floor was painted red, and carefully polished;
      curtains of white calico shaded the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sphere of about four feet in diameter, raised on a pedestal of massive
      oak, stood at one end of the room, opposite to the fireplace. Upon this
      globe, which was painted on a large scale, a host of little red crosses
      appeared scattered over all parts of the world&mdash;from the North to the
      South, from the rising to the setting sun, from the most barbarous
      countries, from the most distant isles, to the centres of civilization, to
      France itself. There was not a single country which did not present some
      spots marked with these red crosses, evidently indicative of stations, or
      serving as points of reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a table of black wood, loaded with papers, and resting against the
      wall near the chimney, a chair stood empty. Further on, between the two
      windows, was a large walnut-wood desk, surmounted by shelves full of
      pasteboard boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the month of October, 1831, about eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, a man sat writing at this desk. This was M. Rodin, the
      correspondent of Morok, the brute-tamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fifty years of age, he wore an old, shabby, olive greatcoat, with a
      greasy collar, a snuff-powdered cotton handkerchief for a cravat, and
      waistcoat and trousers of threadbare black cloth. His feet, buried in
      loose varnished shoes, rested on a petty piece of green baize upon the
      red, polished floor. His gray hair lay flat on his temples, and encircled
      his bald forehead; his eyebrows were scarcely marked; his upper eyelid,
      flabby and overhanging, like the membrane which shades the eyes of
      reptiles, half concealed his small, sharp, black eye. His thin lips,
      absolutely colorless, were hardly distinguishable from the wan hue of his
      lean visage, with its pointed nose and chin; and this livid mask (deprived
      as it were of lips) appeared only the more singular, from its maintaining
      a death-like immobility. Had it not been for the rapid movement of his
      fingers, as, bending over the desk, he scratched along with his pen, M.
      Rodin might have been mistaken for a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the aid of a cipher (or secret alphabet) placed before him he was
      copying certain passages from a long sheet full of writing, in a manner
      quite unintelligible to those who did not possess the key to the system.
      Whilst the darkness of the day increased the gloom of the large, cold,
      naked-looking apartment, there was something awful in the chilling aspect
      of this man, tracing his mysterious characters in the midst of profound
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck eight. The dull sound of the knocker at the outer door
      was heard, then a bell tinkled twice, several doors opened and shut, and a
      new personage entered the chamber. On seeing him, M. Rodin rose from the
      desk, stuck his pen between his teeth, bowed with a deeply submissive air,
      and sat down again to his work without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two formed a striking contrast to one another. The newcomer, though
      really older than he seemed, would have passed for thirty-six or thirty
      eight years of age at most. His figure was tall and shapely, and few could
      have encountered the brightness of his large gray eye, brilliant as
      polished steel. His nose, broad at the commencement, formed a well-cut
      square at its termination; his chin was prominent, and the bluish tints of
      his close-shaved beard were contrasted with the bright carnation of his
      lips, and the whiteness of his fine teeth. When he took off his hat to
      change it for a black velvet cap which he found on the small table, he
      displayed a quantity of light chestnut hair, not yet silvered by time. He
      was dressed in a long frock-coat, buttoned up to the neck in military
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piercing glance and broad forehead of this man revealed a powerful
      intellect, even as the development of his chest and shoulders announced a
      vigorous physical organization; whilst his gentlemanly appearance, the
      perfection of his gloves and boots, the light perfume which hung about his
      hair and person, the grace and ease of his least movements, betrayed what
      is called the man of the world, and left the impression that he had sought
      or might still seek every kind of success, from the most frivolous to the
      most serious. This rare combination of strength of mind, strength of body,
      and extreme elegance of manners, was in this instance rendered still more
      striking by the circumstance, that whatever there might be of haughtiness
      or command in the upper part of that energetic countenance, was softened
      down, and tempered by a constant but not uniform smile&mdash;for, as
      occasion served, this smile became either kind or sly, cordial or gay,
      discreet or prepossessing, and thus augmented the insinuating charm of
      this man, who, once seen, was never again forgotten. But, in yielding to
      this involuntary sympathy, the doubt occurred if the influence was for
      good&mdash;or for evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rodin, the secretary of the newcomer, continued to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any letters from Dunkirk, Rodin?&rdquo; inquired his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Post not yet in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without being positively uneasy as to my mother&rsquo;s health,
      since she was already convalescent,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;I
      shall only be quite reassured by a letter from my excellent friend, the
      Princess de Saint Dizier. I shall have good news this morning, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be desired,&rdquo; said the secretary, as humble and
      submissive as he was laconic and impassible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it is to be desired,&rdquo; resumed his master; &ldquo;for
      one of the brightest days of my life was when the Princess de Saint-Dizier
      announced to me that this sudden and dangerous illness had yielded to the
      care and attention with which she surrounds my mother. Had it not been for
      that I must have gone down to her instantly, though my presence here is
      very necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, approaching the desk, he added: &ldquo;Is the summary of the foreign
      correspondence complete?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the analysis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters are still sent under envelope to the places named, and
      are then brought here as I directed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read to me the notes of this correspondence; if there are any
      letters for me to answer, I will tell you.&rdquo; And Rodin&rsquo;s master
      began to walk up and down the room, with his hands crossed behind his
      back, dictating observations of which Rodin took careful note.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary turned to a pretty large pile of papers, and thus began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Raymond Olivarez acknowledges from Cadiz receipt of letter
      No.19; he will conform to it, and deny all share in the abduction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; file it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Romanoff, of Riga, finds himself in a position of pecuniary
      embarrassment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Duplessis send him fifty louis; I formerly served as captain in
      his regiment, and he has since given us good information.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have received at Philadelphia the last cargo of Histories of
      France, expurgated for the use of the faithful they require some more of
      the same sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take note of it, and write to Duplessis. Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Spindler sends from Namur the secret report on M. Ardouin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be examined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Ardouin sends from the same town the secret report on M.
      Spindler.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be examined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Van Ostadt, of the same town, sends a confidential note on
      the subject of Messrs. Spindler and Ardouin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be compared. Go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Malipierri, of Turin, announces that the donation of 300,000
      francs is signed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inform Duplessis. What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don Stanislaus has just quitted the waters of Baden with Queen
      Marie Ernestine. He informs us that her majesty will receive with
      gratitude the promised advices, and will answer them with her own hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a note of it. I will myself write to the queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Rodin was inscribing a few remarks on the margin of the paper, his
      master, continuing to walk up and down the room, found himself opposite to
      the globe marked with little red crosses, and stood contemplating it for a
      moment with a pensive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin continued: &ldquo;In consequence of the state of the public mind in
      certain parts of Italy, where sundry agitators have turned their eyes in
      the direction of France, Father Arsenio writes from Milan, that it would
      be of importance to distribute profusely in that country, some little
      book, in which the French would be represented as impious and debauched,
      rapacious and bloody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is excellent. We might turn to good account the excesses
      committed by our troops in Italy during the wars of the Republic. You must
      employ Jacques Dumoulin to write it. He is full of gall, spite, and venom:
      the pamphlet will be scorching. Besides, I may furnish a few notes; but
      you must not pay Dumoulin till after delivery of the manuscript.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well understood: for, if we were to pay him beforehand, he
      would be drunk for a week in some low den. It was thus we had to pay him
      twice over for his virulent attack on the pantheistic tendencies of
      Professor Martin&rsquo;s philosophy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take note of it&mdash;and go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The merchant announces that the clerk is about to send the banker
      to give in his accounts. You understand?&rsquo; added Rodin, after
      pronouncing these words with a marked emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said the other, with a start; &ldquo;they are but
      the expressions agreed on. What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the clerk,&rdquo; continued the secretary, &ldquo;is restrained
      by a last scruple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which the features of Rodin&rsquo;s
      master worked strongly, he thus resumed: &ldquo;They must continue to act
      on the clerk&rsquo;s mind by silence and solitude; then, let him read once
      more the list of cases in which regicide is authorized and absolved. Go
      on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman Sydney writes from Dresden, that she waits for
      instructions. Violent scenes of jealousy on her account have again taken
      place between the father and son; but neither from these new bursts of
      mutual hatred, nor from the confidential communications which each has
      made to her against his rival, has she yet been able to glean the
      information required. Hitherto, she has avoided giving the preference to
      one or the other; but, should this situation be prolonged, she fears it
      may rouse their suspicion. Which ought she then to choose&mdash;the father
      or the son?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son&mdash;for jealous resentment will be much more violent and
      cruel in the old man, and, to revenge himself for the preference bestowed
      upon his son, he will perhaps tell what they have both such an interest to
      conceal. The next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within the last three years, two maid-servants of Ambrosius whom we
      placed in that little parish in the mountains of the Valais, have
      disappeared, without any one knowing what has become of them. A third has
      just met with the same fate. The Protestants of the country are roused&mdash;talk
      of murder with frightful attendant circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until there is proof positive and complete of the fact, Ambrosius
      must be defended against these infamous calumnies, the work of a party
      that never shrinks from; monstrous inventions. Go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thompson, of Liverpool, has at length succeeded in procuring for
      Justin the place of agent or manager to Lord Stewart, a rich Irish
      Catholic, whose head grows daily weaker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the fact be once verified, and Thompson shall have a premium of
      fifty louis. Make a note of it for Duplessis. Proceed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frantz Dichstein, of Vienna,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;announces
      that his father has just died of the cholera, in a little village at some
      leagues from that city: for the epidemic continues to advance slowly,
      coming from the north of Russia by way of Poland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Rodin&rsquo;s master, interrupting him;
      &ldquo;may its terrible march be stayed, and France be spared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frantz Dichstein,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;says that his two
      brothers are determined to contest the donation made by his father, but
      that he is of an opposite opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consult the two persons that are charged with all matters of
      litigation. What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cardinal Prince d&rsquo;Amalfi will conform to the three first
      points of the proposal: he demands to make a reservation upon the fourth
      point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No reserve!&mdash;Either full and absolute acceptance&mdash;or else
      war&mdash;and (mark me well) war without mercy&mdash;on him and his
      creatures. Go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fra Paolo announces that the Prince Boccari, chief of a redoubtable
      secret society, in despair at seeing his friends accuse him of treachery,
      in consequence of suspicions excited in their minds by Fra Paolo himself,
      has committed suicide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boccari! is it possible?&rdquo; cried Rodin&rsquo;s master. &ldquo;Boccari!
      the patriot Boccari! so dangerous a person!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The patriot Boccari,&rdquo; repeated the impassible secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Duplessis to send an order for five-and-twenty louis to Fra
      Paolo. Make a note of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hausman informs us that the French dancer, Albertine Ducornet, is
      the mistress of the reigning prince; she has the most complete influence
      over him, and it would be easy through her means to arrive at the end
      proposed, but that she is herself governed by her lover (condemned in
      France as a forger), and that she does nothing without consulting him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Hausman get hold of this man&mdash;if his claims are
      reasonable, accede to them&mdash;and learn if the girl has any relations
      in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke d&rsquo;Orbano announces, that the king his master will
      authorize the new establishment, but on the conditions previously stated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No condition!&mdash;either a frank adhesion or a positive refusal.
      Let us know our friends from our enemies. The more unfavorable the
      circumstances, the more we must show firmness, and overbear opposition by
      confidence in ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same also announces, that the whole of the corps diplomatique
      continues to support the claims of the father of that young Protestant
      girl, who refuses to quit the convent where she has taken refuge, unless
      it be to marry her lover against her father&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the corps diplomatique continues to remonstrate in the father&rsquo;s
      name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, continue to answer, that the spiritual power has nothing to
      do with the temporal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the bell of the outer door again sounded twice. &ldquo;See
      who it is,&rdquo; said Rodin&rsquo;s master; and the secretary rose and
      left the room. The other continued to walk thoughtfully up and down, till,
      coming near to the huge globe, he stopped short before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time he contemplated, in profound silence, the innumerable little
      red crosses, which appeared to cover, as with an immense net, all the
      countries of the earth. Reflecting doubtless on the invisible action of
      his power, which seemed to extend over the whole world, the features of
      this man became animated, his large gray eye sparkled, his nostrils
      swelled, and his manly countenance assumed an indescribable expression of
      pride, energy, and daring. With haughty brow and scornful lip, he drew
      still nearer to the globe, and leaned his strong hand upon the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      This powerful pressure, an imperious movement, as of one taking
      possession, seemed to indicate, that he felt sure of governing this globe,
      on which he looked down from the height of his tall figure, and on which
      he rested his hand with so lofty and audacious an air of sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he no longer smiled. His eye threatened, and his large forehead
      was clad with a formidable scowl. The artist, who had wished to paint the
      demon of craft and pride, the infernal genius of insatiable domination,
      could not have chosen a more suitable model.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rodin returned, the face of his master had recovered its ordinary
      expression. &ldquo;It is the postman,&rdquo; said Rodin, showing the
      letters which he held in his hand; &ldquo;there is nothing from Dunkirk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; cried his master&mdash;and his painful emotion
      formed a strange contrast to his late haughty and implacable expression of
      countenance&mdash;&ldquo;nothing? no news of my mother?&mdash;Thirty-six
      hours more, then, of anxiety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, that, if the princess had bad news to give, she
      would have written. Probably the improvement goes on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doubtless right, Rodin&mdash;but no matter&mdash;I am far
      from easy. If, to-morrow, the news should not be completely satisfactory,
      I set out for the estate of the princess. Why would my mother pass the
      autumn in that part of the country? The environs of Dunkirk do not, I
      fear, agree with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments&rsquo; silence, he added, as he continued to walk:
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;these letters&mdash;whence are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked at the post-marks, and replied: &ldquo;Out of the four there
      are three relative to the great and important affairs of the medals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven!&mdash;provided the news be favorable,&rdquo; cried
      his master, with an expression of uneasiness, which showed how much
      importance he attached to this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is from Charlestown, and no doubt relative to Gabriel, the
      missionary,&rdquo; answered Rodin; &ldquo;this other from Batavia, and no
      doubt concerns the Indian, Djalma. The third is from Leipsic, and will
      probably confirm that received yesterday, in which the lion-tamer, Morok,
      informed us, that, in accordance with his orders, and without his being
      compromised in any way, the daughters of General Simon would not be able
      to continue their journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the name of General Simon, a cloud passed over the features of Rodin&rsquo;s
      master.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he principal
      houses correspond with that in Paris; they are also in direct
      communication with the General, who resides at Rome. The correspondence of
      the Jesuits so active, various, and organized in so wonderful a manner,
      has for its object to supply the heads with all the information they can
      require. Every day, the General receives a host of reports, which serve to
      check one another. In the central house, at Rome, are immense registers,
      in which are inscribed the names of all the Jesuits, of their adherents,
      and of all the considerable persons, whether friends or enemies, with whom
      they have any connection. In these registers are reported, without
      alteration, hatred or passion the facts relating to the life of each
      individual. It is the most gigantic biographical collection that has ever
      been formed. The frailties of a woman, the secret errors of a statesman,
      are chronicled in this book with the same cold impartiality. Drawn up for
      the purpose of being useful, these biographies are necessarily exact. When
      the Jesuits wish to influence an individual, they have but to turn to this
      book, and they know immediately his life, his character, his parts, his
      faults, his projects, his family, his friends, his most sacred ties.
      Conceive, what a superior facility of action this immense police-register,
      which includes the whole world, must give to any one society! It is not
      lightly that I speak of these registers; I have my facts from a person who
      has seen this collection, and who is perfectly well acquainted with the
      Jesuits. Here then, is matter to reflect on for all those families, who
      admit freely into their houses the members of a community that carries its
      biographical researches to such a point. (Libri, Member of the Institute.

    </p>
    <p>
      When he had conquered the involuntary emotion which the name or
      remembrance of General Simon had occasioned, Rodin&rsquo;s master said to
      the secretary: &ldquo;Do not yet open the letters from Leipsic,
      Charlestown, and Batavia; the information they contain will doubtless find
      its place presently. It will save our going over the same ground twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary looked inquiringly at his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter continued&mdash;&ldquo;Have you finished the note relating to
      the medals?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; replied the secretary; &ldquo;I was just
      finishing my interpretation of the cipher.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it to me, in the order of the facts. You can append to it the
      news contained in those three letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Rodin; &ldquo;in that way the letters will find
      their right place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;whether this note
      is clear and fully explanatory; you did not forget that the person it is
      intended for ought not to know all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bore it in mind, and drew up the paper accordingly.&rdquo;

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; said the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rodin read as follows, slowly and deliberately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A hundred and fifty years ago, a French Protestant family,
      foreseeing the speedy&mdash;revocation of the edict of Nantes, went into
      voluntary exile, in order to avoid the just and rigorous decrees already
      issued against the members of the reformed church&mdash;those indomitable
      foes of our holy religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Some members of this family sought refuge in Holland, and
      afterwards in the Dutch colonies; others in Poland, others in Germany;
      some in England, and some in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is supposed that only seven descendants remain of this
      family, which underwent strange vicissitudes since; its present
      representatives are found in all ranks of society, from the sovereign to
      the mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;These descendants, direct or indirect, are:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the mother&rsquo;s side,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Rose and Blanche Simon&mdash;minors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;General Simon married, at Warsaw, a descendant of the said
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Francois Hardy, manufacturer at Plessis, near Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Prince Djalma, son of Kadja-sing, King of Mondi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Kadja-sing, married, in 1802, a descendant of the said
      family, then settled at Batavia, in the Island of Java, a Dutch colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the father&rsquo;s side&mdash;Jacques Rennepont, surnamed
      Sleepinbuff, mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Adrienne de Cardoville, daughter of the Count of Rennepont,
      Duke of Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gabriel Rennepont, priest of the foreign missions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All the members of this family possess, or should possess, a
      bronze medal bearing the following inscriptions:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                Victim
                  of
               L. C. D. J.
               Pray for me!
                 Paris
            February the 13th, 1682.

                At Paris,
            Rue Saint Francois, No. 3,
            In a century and a half
               you will be.
            February the 13th, 1832.
               Pray For Me!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;These words and dates show that all of them have a great
      interest to be at Paris on the 13th of February, 1832; and that, not by
      proxy, but in person, whether they are minors, married or single.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But other persons have an immense interest that none of the
      descendants of this family be at Paris on the 13th February, except
      Gabriel Rennepont, priest of the foreign missions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At all hazards, therefore, Gabriel must be the only person
      present at the appointment made with the descendants of this family, a
      century and a half ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To prevent the other six persons from reaching Paris on the
      said day, or to render their presence of no effect, much has been already
      done; but much remains to be done to ensure the success of this affair,
      which is considered as the most vital and most important of the age, on
      account of its probable results.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis but too true,&rdquo; observed Rodin&rsquo;s master,
      interrupting him, and shaking his head pensively. &ldquo;And, moreover,
      that the consequences of success are incalculable, and there is no
      forseeing what may follow failure. In a word, it almost involves a
      question of existence or non existence during several years. To succeed,
      therefore, &lsquo;all possible means must be employed. Nothing must be
      shunned,&rsquo; except, however, that appearances must be skillfully
      maintained.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written it,&rdquo; said Rodin, having added the words his
      master had just dictated, who then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To forward or secure the affair in question, it is necessary
      to give some private and secret particulars respecting the seven persons
      who represent this family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The truth of these particulars may be relied on. In case of
      need they might be completed in the most minute degree for contradictory
      information having been given, very lengthened evidence has been obtained.
      The order in which the names of the persons stand will be observed, and
      events that have happened up to the present time will only be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOTE, No. I. &ldquo;&lsquo;Rose and Blanche Simon, twin
      sisters, about fifteen years of age; very pretty, so much alike, one might
      be taken for the other; mild and timid disposition, but capable of
      enthusiasm. Brought up in Siberia by their mother, a woman of strong mind
      and deistical sentiments, they are wholly ignorant of our holy religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;General Simon, separated from his wife before they were
      born, is not aware, even now, that he has two daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was hoped that their presence in Paris, on the 13th of
      February, would be prevented, by sending their mother to a place of exile,
      much more distant than the one first allotted her; but their mother dying,
      the Governor of Siberia, who is wholly ours, supposing, by a deplorable
      mistake, that the measure only affected the wife of General Simon
      personally, unfortunately allowed the girls to return to France, under the
      guidance of an old soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This man is enterprising, faithful, and determined. He is
      noted down as dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Simon girls are inoffensive. It is hoped, on fair
      grounds, that they are now detained in the neighborhood of Leipsic.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin&rsquo;s master interrupted him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, read the letter just received from Leipsic; it may complete
      the information.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin read it, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent news! The maidens and their guide had succeeded in
      escaping during the night from the White Falcon Tavern, but all three were
      overtaken and seized about a league from Mockern. They have been
      transferred to Leipsic, where they are imprisoned as vagabonds; their
      guide, the soldier, is accused and condemned of resisting the authorities,
      and using violence to a magistrate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is almost certain, then, considering the tedious mode of
      proceeding in Germany (otherwise we would see to it), that the girls will
      not be able to be here on the 13th February,&rdquo; added Rodin&rsquo;s
      master. &ldquo;Append this to the note on the back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary obeyed, and endorsed &ldquo;An abstract of Morok&rsquo;s
      letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is written,&rdquo; he then added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; resumed his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin continued reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOTE, No. II. &ldquo;&lsquo;Francois Hardy, manufacturer at
      Plessis, near Paris, forty years old; a steady, rich, intelligent, active,
      honest, well-informed man, idolized by his workmen&mdash;thanks to
      numberless innovations to promote their welfare. Never attending to the
      duties of our holy religion. Noted down as a very dangerous man: but the
      hatred and envy he excites among other manufacturers, especially in M. le
      Baron Tripeaud, his competitor, may easily be turned against him. If other
      means of action on his account, and against him, are necessary, the
      evidence may be consulted; it is very voluminous. This man has been marked
      and watched for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He has been so effectually misguided with respect to the
      medal, that he is completely deceived as to the interests it represents.
      He is, however, constantly watched, surrounded, and governed, without
      suspecting it; one of his dearest friends deceives him, and through his
      means we know his secret thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOTE, No. III. &ldquo;&lsquo;Prince Djalma; eighteen;
      energetic and generous, haughty, independent and wild; favorite of General
      Simon, who commanded the troops of his father, Kadja-sing, in the struggle
      maintained by the latter against the English in India. Djalma is mentioned
      only by way of reminder, for his mother died young, while her parents were
      living. They resided at Batavia. On the death of the latter, neither
      Djalma nor the king, his father, claimed their little property. It is,
      therefore, certain that they are ignorant of the grave interests connected
      with the possession of the medal in question, which formed part of the
      property of Djalma&rsquo;s mother."&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin&rsquo;s master interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now read the letter from Batavia, and complete the information
      respecting Djalma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin read, and then observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news again. Joshua Van Dael, merchant at Batavia (he was
      educated in our Pondicherry establishment), learns from his correspondent
      at Calcutta that the old Indian king was killed in the last battle with
      the English. His son, Djalma, deprived of the paternal throne, is
      provisionally detained as a prisoner of state in an Indian fortress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are at the end of October,&rdquo; said Rodin&rsquo;s master.
      &ldquo;If Prince Djalma were to leave India now, he could scarcely reach
      Paris by the month of February.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Van Dael,&rdquo; continued Rodin, &ldquo;regrets that he has not
      been able to prove his zeal in this case. Supposing Prince Djalma set at
      liberty, or having effected his escape, it is certain he would come to
      Batavia to claim his inheritance from his mother, since he has nothing
      else left him in the world. In that case, you may rely on Van Dael&rsquo;s
      devotedness. In return, he solicits very precise information, by the next
      post, respecting the fortune of M. le Baron Tripeaud, banker and
      manufacturer, with whom he has business transactions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer that point evasively. Van Dael as yet has only shown zeal;
      complete the information respecting Djalma from these new tidings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in a few minutes his master said to him with a singular expression:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not Van Dael mention General Simon in connection with Djalma&rsquo;s
      imprisonment and his father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not allude to him,&rdquo; said the secretary, continuing
      his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin&rsquo;s master was silent, and paced the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Rodin said to him: &ldquo;I have done it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOTE, No. IV. &ldquo;&lsquo;Jacques Rennepont, surnamed
      &ldquo;Sleepinbuff,&rdquo; i.e. Lie naked, workman in Baron Tripeaud&rsquo;s
      factory. This artisan is drunken, idle, noisy, and prodigal; he is not
      without sense, but idleness and debauch have ruined him. A clever agent,
      on whom we rely, has become acquainted with his mistress, Cephyse
      Soliveau, nicknamed the Bacchanal Queen. Through her means, the agent has
      formed such ties with him that he may even now be considered beyond the
      reach of the interests that ought to insure his presence in Paris on the
      13th of February.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOTE, No. V. &ldquo;&lsquo;Gabriel Rennepont, priest of
      foreign missions, distant relation of the above, but he is alike ignorant
      of the existence of his relative and the relationship. An orphan
      foundling, he was adopted by Frances Baudoin, the wife of a soldier going
      by the name Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Should this soldier, contrary to expectation, reach Paris,
      his wife would be a powerful means of influencing him. She is an excellent
      creature, ignorant and credulous, of exemplary piety, over whom we have
      long had unlimited control. She prevailed on Gabriel to take orders,
      notwithstanding his repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gabriel is five-and-twenty; disposition as angelic as his
      countenance; rare and solid virtues; unfortunately he was brought up with
      his adopted brother, Agricola, Dagobert&rsquo;s son. This Agricola is a
      poet and workman&mdash;but an excellent workman; he is employed by M.
      Hardy; has imbibed the most detestable doctrines; fond of his mother;
      honest, laborious, but without religious feeling. Marked as very
      dangerous. This causes his intimacy with Gabriel to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The latter, notwithstanding his excellent qualities,
      sometimes causes uneasiness. We have even delayed confiding in him fully.
      A false step might make him, too, one of the most dangerous. Much
      precaution must be used then, especially till the 13th of February; since,
      we repeat it, on him, on his presence in Paris at that time, depend
      immense hopes and equally important interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Among other precautions, we have consented to his taking
      part in the American mission, for he unites with angelic sweetness of
      character a calm intrepidity and adventurous spirit which could only be
      satisfied by allowing him to engage in the perilous existence of the
      missionaries. Luckily, his superiors at Charlestown have received the
      strictest orders not to endanger, on any account, so precious a life. They
      are to send him to Paris, at least a month or two before February 13th.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin&rsquo;s master again interrupted him, and said: &ldquo;Read the
      letter from Charlestown, and see what it tells you in order to complete
      the information upon this point also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had read the letter, Rodin went on: &ldquo;Gabriel is expected
      every day from the Rocky Mountains, whither he had absolutely insisted on
      going alone upon a mission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What imprudence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no doubt escaped all danger, as he himself announces his
      speedy return to Charlestown. As soon as he arrives, which cannot (they
      write) be later than the middle of this month, he will be shipped off for
      France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Add this to the note which concerns him,&rdquo; said Rodin&rsquo;s
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is written,&rdquo; replied the secretary, a few moments later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed, then,&rdquo; said his master. Rodin continued
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOTE, No. VI. &ldquo;&lsquo;ADRIENNE RENNEPONT DE
      CARDOVILLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Distantly related (without knowing it) to Jacques Rennepont,
      alias Sleepinbuff, and Gabriel Rennepont, missionary priest. She will soon
      be twenty-one years of age, the most attractive person in the world&mdash;extraordinary
      beauty, though red-haired&mdash;a mind remarkable for its originality&mdash;immense
      fortune&mdash;all the animal instincts. The incredible independence of her
      character makes one tremble for the future fate of this young person.
      Happily, her appointed guardian, Baron Tripeaud (a baron of 1829 creation,
      formerly agent to the late Count of Rennepont, Duke of Cardoville), is
      quite in the interest, and almost in the dependence, of the young lady&rsquo;s
      aunt. We count, with reason, upon this worthy and respectable relative,
      and on the Baron Tripeaud, to oppose and repress the singular, unheard-of
      designs which this young person, as resolute as independent, does not fear
      to avow&mdash;and which, unfortunately, cannot be turned to account in the
      interest of the affair in question&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin was here interrupted by two discreet taps at the door. The secretary
      rose, went to see who knocked, remained a moment without, and then
      returned with two letters in his hand, saying: &ldquo;The princess has
      profited by the departure of a courier to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the letter!&rdquo; cried his master, without leaving him
      time to finish. &ldquo;At length,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall have
      news of my mother&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely read the first few lines of the letter, when he grew
      deadly pale, and his features took an expression of painful astonishment
      and poignant grief. &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;oh, heavens!
      my mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What misfortune has happened!&rdquo; asked Rodin, with a look of
      alarm, as he rose at the exclamation of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The symptoms of improvement were fallacious,&rdquo; replied the
      other, dejectedly; &ldquo;she has now relapsed into a nearly hopeless
      state. And yet the doctor thinks my presence might save her, for she calls
      for me without ceasing. She wishes to see me for the last time, that she
      may die in peace. Oh, that wish is sacred! Not to grant it would be
      matricide. If I can but arrive in time! Travelling day and night, it will
      take nearly two days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! what a misfortune!&rdquo; said Rodin, wringing his hands, and
      raising his eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      His master rang the bell violently, and said to the old servant that
      opened the door: &ldquo;Just put what is indispensable into the
      portmanteau of my travelling-carriage. Let the porter take a cab, and go
      for post horses instantly. Within an hour, I must be on the road. Mother!
      mother!&rdquo; cried he, as the servant departed in haste. &ldquo;Not to
      see her again&mdash;oh, it would be frightful!&rdquo; And sinking upon a
      chair, overwhelmed with sorrow, he covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great grief was sincere&mdash;he loved tenderly his mother that
      divine sentiment had accompanied him, unalterable and pure, through all
      the phases of a too often guilty life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes, Rodin ventured to say to his master, as he showed him
      the second letter: &ldquo;This, also, has just been brought from M.
      Duplessis. It is very important&mdash;very pressing&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what it is, and answer it. I have no head for business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter is confidential,&rdquo; said Rodin, presenting it to his
      master. &ldquo;I dare not open it, as you may see by the mark on the
      cover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of this mark, the countenance of Rodin&rsquo;s master assumed an
      indefinable expression of respect and fear. With a trembling hand he broke
      the seal. The note contained only the following words: &ldquo;Leave all
      business, and without losing a minute, set out and come. M. Duplessis will
      replace you. He has orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; cried this man in despair. &ldquo;Set out before
      I have seen my mother! It is frightful, impossible&mdash;it would perhaps
      kill her&mdash;yes, it would be matricide!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/10161.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Whilst he uttered these words, his eyes rested on the huge globe, marked
      with red crosses. A sudden revolution seemed to take place within him; he
      appeared to repent of the violence of his regrets; his face, though still
      sad, became once more calm and grave. He handed the fatal letter to his
      secretary, and said to him, whilst he stifled a sigh: &ldquo;To be classed
      under its proper number.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin took the letter, wrote a number upon it, and placed it in a
      particular box. After a moment&rsquo;s silence, his master resumed:
      &ldquo;You will take orders from M. Duplessis, and work with him. You will
      deliver to him the note on the affair of the medals; he knows to whom to
      address it. You will write to Batavia, Leipsic, and Charlestown, in the
      sense agreed. Prevent, at any price, the daughters of General Simon from
      quitting Leipsic; hasten the arrival of Gabriel in Paris; and should
      Prince Djalma come to Batavia, tell M. Joshua Van Dael, that we count on
      his zeal and obedience to keep him there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And this man, who, while his dying mother called to him in vain, could
      thus preserve his presence of mind, entered his own apartments; whilst
      Rodin busied himself with the answers he had been ordered to write, and
      transcribed them in cipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about three quarters of an hour, the bells of the post-horses were
      heard jingling without. The old servant again entered, after discreetly
      knocking at the door, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin nodded, and the servant withdrew. The secretary, in his turn, went
      to knock at the door of the inner room. His master appeared, still grave
      and cold, but fearfully pale, and holding a letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This for my mother,&rdquo; said he to Rodin; &ldquo;you will send a
      courier on the instant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the instant,&rdquo; replied the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the three letters for Leipsic, Batavia and Charlestown, leave
      to-day by the ordinary channel. They are of the last importance. You know
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were his last words. Executing merciless orders with a merciless
      obedience, he departed without even attempting to see his mother. His
      secretary accompanied him respectfully to his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What road, sir?&rdquo; asked the postilion, turning round on his
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road to ITALY!&rdquo; answered Rodin&rsquo;s master, with so
      deep a sigh that it almost resembled a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the horses started at full gallop, Rodin made a low bow; then he
      returned to the large, cold, bare apartment. The attitude, countenance,
      and gait of this personage seemed to have undergone a sudden change. He
      appeared to have increased in dimensions. He was no longer an automaton,
      moved by the mechanism of humble obedience. His features, till now
      impassible, his glance, hitherto subdued, became suddenly animated with an
      expression of diabolical craft; a sardonic smile curled his thin, pale
      lips, and a look of grim satisfaction relaxed his cadaverous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn, he stopped before the huge globe. In turn, he contemplated it in
      silence, even as his master had done. Then, bending over it, and embracing
      it, as it were, in his arms, he gloated with his reptile-eye on it for
      some moments, drew his coarse finger along its polished surface, and
      tapped his flat, dirty nail on three of the places dotted with red
      crosses. And, whilst he thus pointed to three towns, in very different
      parts of the world, he named them aloud, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leipsic&mdash;Charlestown&mdash;Batavia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In each of these three places,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;distant as
      they are from one another, there exist persons who little think that here,
      in this obscure street, from the recesses of this chamber, wakeful eyes
      are upon them&mdash;that all their movements are followed, all their
      actions known&mdash;and that hence will issue new instructions, which
      deeply concern them, and which will be inexorably executed; for an
      interest is at stake, which may have a powerful influence on Europe&mdash;on
      the world. Luckily, we have friends at Leipsic, Charlestown, and Batavia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This funny, old, sordid, ill-dressed man, with his livid and death-like
      countenance, thus crawling over the sphere before him, appeared still more
      awful than his master, when the latter, erect and haughty, had imperiously
      laid his hand upon that globe, which he seemed desirous of subjecting by
      the strength of his pride and courage. The one resembled the eagle, that
      hovers above his prey&mdash;the other the reptile, that envelops its
      victim in its inextricable folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes, Rodin approached his desk, rubbing his hands briskly
      together, and wrote the following epistle in a cipher unknown even to his
      master:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris, 3/4 past 9 A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone&mdash;but he hesitated!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he received the order, his dying mother had just summoned him
      to her. He might, they told him, save her by his presence; and he
      exclaimed: &lsquo;Not to go to my mother would be matricide!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, he is gone&mdash;but he hesitated. I keep my eye upon him
      continually. These lines will reach Rome at the same time as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Tell the Cardinal-Prince that he may rely on me, but I
      hope for his active aid in return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had folded and sealed this letter, Rodin put it into his pocket.
      The clock struck ten, M. Rodin&rsquo;s hour for breakfast. He arranged and
      locked up his papers in a drawer, of which he carried away the key,
      brushed his old greasy hat with his sleeve, took a patched umbrella in his
      hand, and went out. (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst these two men, in the depths of their obscure retreat, were thus
      framing a plot, which was to involve the seven descendants of a race
      formerly proscribed&mdash;a strange mysterious defender was planning how
      to protect this family, which was also his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 Having cited the excellent, courageous letters of M. Libri, and the
      curious work edited by M. Paulin, it is our duty likewise to mention many
      bold and conscientious writings on the subject of the &ldquo;Society of
      Jesus,&rdquo; recently published by the elder Dupin, Michelet, Quinet,
      Genin, and the Count de Saint Priest&mdash;works of high and impartial
      intellects, in which the fatal theories of the order are admirably exposed
      and condemned. We esteem ourselves happy, if we can bring one stone
      towards the erection of the strong, and, we hope, durable embankment which
      these generous hearts and noble minds are raising against the
      encroachments of an impure and always menacing flood.&mdash;E. S.

    <h2>
      INTERVAL.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE WANDERING JEW&rsquo;S SENTENCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The site is wild and rugged. It is a lofty eminence covered with huge
      boulders of sandstone, between which rise birch trees and oaks, their
      foliage already yellowed by autumn. These tall trees stand out from the
      background of red light, which the sun has left in the west, resembling
      the reflection of a great fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this eminence the eye looks down into a deep valley, shady, fertile,
      and half-veiled in light vapor by the evening mist. The rich meadows, the
      tufts of bushy trees the fields from which the ripe corn has been gathered
      in, all blend together in one dark, uniform tint, which contrasts with the
      limpid azure of the heavens. Steeples of gray stone or slate lift their
      pointed spires, at intervals, from the midst of this valley; for many
      villages are spread about it, bordering a high-road which leads from the
      north to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the hour of repose&mdash;the hour when, for the most part, every
      cottage window brightens to the joyous crackling of the rustic hearth, and
      shines afar through shade and foliage, whilst clouds of smoke issue from
      the chimneys, and curl up slowly towards the sky. But now, strange to say,
      every hearth in the country seems cold and deserted. Stranger and more
      fatal still, every steeple rings out a funeral knell. Whatever there is of
      activity, movement, or life, appears concentrated in that lugubrious and
      far-sounding vibration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lights begin to show themselves in the dark villages, but they rise not
      from the cheerful and pleasant rustic hearth. They are as red as the fires
      of the herdsmen, seen at night through the midst of the fog. And then
      these lights do not remain motionless. They creep slowly towards the
      churchyard of every village. Louder sounds the death-knell, the air
      trembles beneath the strokes of so many bells, and, at rare intervals, the
      funeral chant rises faintly to the summit of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why so many interments? What valley of desolation is this, where the
      peaceful songs which follow the hard labors of the day are replaced by the
      death dirge? where the repose of evening is exchanged for the repose of
      eternity? What is this valley of the shadow, where every village mourns
      for its many dead, and buries them at the same hour of the same night?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! the deaths are so sudden and numerous and frightful that there is
      hardly time to bury the dead. During day the survivors are chained to the
      earth by hard but necessary toil; and only in the evening, when they
      return from the fields, are they able, though sinking with fatigue, to dig
      those other furrows, in which their brethren are to lie heaped like grains
      of corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this valley is not the only one that has seen the desolation. During a
      series of fatal years, many villages, many towns, many cities, many great
      countries, have seen, like this valley, their hearths deserted and cold&mdash;have
      seen, like this valley, mourning take the place of joy, and the
      death-knell substituted for the noise of festival&mdash;have wept in the
      same day for their many dead, and buried them at night by the lurid glare
      of torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, during those fatal years, an awful wayfarer had slowly journeyed over
      the earth, from one pole to the other&mdash;from the depths of India and
      Asia to the ice of Siberia&mdash;from the ice of Siberia to the borders of
      the seas of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      This traveller, mysterious as death, slow as eternity, implacable as fate,
      terrible as the hand of heaven, was the CHOLERA!
    </p>
    <p>
      The tolling of bells and the funeral chants still rose from the depths of
      the valley to the summit of the hill, like the complaining of a mighty
      voice; the glare of the funeral torches was still seen afar through the
      mist of evening; it was the hour of twilight&mdash;that strange hour,
      which gives to the most solid forms a vague, indefinite fantastic
      appearance&mdash;when the sound of firm and regular footsteps was heard on
      the stony soil of the rising ground, and, between the black trunks of the
      trees, a man passed slowly onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      His figure was tall, his head was bowed upon his breast; his countenance
      was noble, gentle, and sad; his eyebrows, uniting in the midst, extended
      from one temple to the other, like a fatal mark on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man did not seem to hear the distant tolling of so many funeral bells&mdash;and
      yet, a few days before, repose and happiness, health and joy, had reigned
      in those villages through which he had slowly passed, and which he now
      left behind him, mourning and desolate. But the traveller continued on his
      way, absorbed in his own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 13th of February approaches,&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;the day
      approaches, in which the descendants of my beloved sister, the last scions
      of our race, should meet in Paris. Alas! it is now a hundred and fifty
      years since, for the third time, persecution scattered this family over
      all the earth&mdash;this family, that I have watched over with tenderness
      for eighteen centuries, through all its migrations and exiles, its changes
      of religion, fortune, and name!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for this family, descended from the sister of the poor
      shoemaker,(2) what grandeur and what abasement, what obscurity and what
      splendor, what misery and what glory! By how many crimes has it been
      sullied, by how many virtues honored! The history of this single family is
      the history of the human race!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing, in the course of so many generations, through the veins of
      the poor and the rich, of the sovereign and the bandit, of the wise man
      and the fool, of the coward and the brave, of the saint and the atheist,
      the blood of my sister has transmitted itself to this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What scions of this family are now remaining? Seven only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two orphans, the daughters of proscribed parents&mdash;a dethroned
      prince&mdash;a poor missionary priest&mdash;a man of the middle class&mdash;a
      young girl of a great name and large fortune&mdash;a mechanic.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Together, they comprise in themselves the virtues, the courage, the
      degradation, the splendor, the miseries of our species!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Siberia&mdash;India&mdash;America&mdash;France&mdash;behold the
      divers places where fate has thrown them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My instinct teaches me when one of them is in peril. Then, from the
      North to the South, from the East to the West, I go to seek them.
      Yesterday amid the polar frosts&mdash;to-day in the temperate zone&mdash;to-morrow
      beneath the fires of the tropics&mdash;but often, alas! at the moment when
      my presence might save them, the invisible hand impels me, the whirlwind
      carries me away, and the voice speaks in my ear: &lsquo;GO ON! GO ON!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that I might only finish my task!&mdash;&lsquo;GO ON!&rsquo;&mdash;A
      single hour&mdash;only a single hour of repose!&mdash;&lsquo;GO ON!&rsquo;&mdash;Alas!
      I leave those I love on the brink of the abyss!&mdash;&lsquo;GO ON! GO ON!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is my punishment. If it is great, my crime was greater still!
      An artisan, devoted to privations and misery, my misfortunes had made me
      cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cursed, cursed be the day, when, as I bent over my work, sullen
      with hate and despair, because, in spite of my incessant labor, I and mine
      wanted for everything, the Saviour passed before my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reviled, insulted, covered with blows, hardly able to sustain the
      weight of his heavy cross, He asked me to let Him rest a moment on my
      stone bench. The sweat poured from His forehead, His feet were bleeding,
      He was well-nigh sinking with fatigue, and He said to me, in a mild, heart
      piercing voice: &lsquo;I suffer!&rsquo; &lsquo;And I too suffer,&rsquo; I
      replied, as with harsh anger I pushed Him from the place; &lsquo;I suffer,
      and no one comes to help me! I find no pity, and will give none. Go on! go
      on!&rsquo; Then, with a deep sigh of pain, He answered, and spake this
      sentence: &lsquo;Verily, thou shalt go on till the day of thy redemption,
      for so wills the Father which art in heaven!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so my punishment began. Too late I opened these eyes to the
      light, too late I learned repentance and charity, too late I understood
      those divine words of Him I had outraged, words which should be the law of
      the whole human race. &lsquo;LOVE YE ONE ANOTHER.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In vain through successive ages, gathering strength and eloquence
      from those celestial words, have I labored to earn my pardon, by filling
      with commiseration and love hearts that were overflowing with envy and
      bitterness, by inspiring many a soul with a sacred horror of oppression
      and injustice. For me the day of mercy has not yet dawned!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even as the first man, by his fall, devoted his posterity to
      misfortune, it would seem as if I, the workman, had consigned the whole
      race of artisans to endless sorrows, and as if they were expiating my
      crime: for they alone, during these eighteen centuries, have not yet been
      delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For eighteen centuries, the powerful and the happy of this world
      have said to the toiling people what I said to the imploring and suffering
      Saviour: &lsquo;Go on! go on!&rsquo; And the people, sinking with fatigue,
      bearing their heavy cross, have answered in the bitterness of their grief:
      &lsquo;Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake! a few moments of repose; we are worn out
      with toil.&rsquo;&mdash;Go on!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And if we perish in our
      pain, what will become of our little children and our aged mothers?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Go
      on! go on!&rsquo; And, for eighteen centuries, they and I have continued
      to struggle forward and to suffer, and no charitable voice has yet
      pronounced the word &lsquo;Enough!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! such is my punishment. It is immense, it is two-fold. I
      suffer in the name of humanity, when I see these wretched multitudes
      consigned without respite to profitless and oppressive toil. I suffer in
      the name of my family, when, poor and wandering, I am unable to bring aid
      to the descendants of my dear sister. But, when the sorrow is above my
      strength, when I foresee some danger from which I cannot preserve my own,
      then my thoughts, travelling over the world, go in search of that woman
      like me accursed, that daughter of a queen, who, like me, the son of a
      laborer, wanders, and will wander on, till the day of her redemption.(3)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once in a century, as two planets draw nigh to each other in their
      revolutions, I am permitted to meet this woman during the dread week of
      the Passion. And after this interview, filled with terrible remembrances
      and boundless griefs, wandering stars of eternity, we pursue our infinite
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this woman, the only one upon earth who, like me, sees the end
      of every century, and exclaims: &lsquo;What another?&rsquo; this woman
      responds to my thought, from the furthest extremity of the world. She, who
      alone shares my terrible destiny, has chosen to share also the only
      interest that has consoled me for so many ages. Those descendants of my
      dear sister, she too loves, she too protects them. For them she journeys
      likewise from East to West and from North to South.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But alas! the invisible hand impels her, the whirlwind carries her
      away, and the voice speaks in her ear: &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh
      that I might finish my sentence!&rsquo; repeats she also,&mdash;&lsquo;Go
      on!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A single hour&mdash;only a single hour of repose!&rsquo;&mdash;Go
      on!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I leave those I love on the brink of the abyss.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Go
      on! Go on!&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this man thus went over the hill absorbed in his thoughts, the
      light evening breeze increased almost to a gale, a vivid flash streamed
      across the sky, and long, deep whistlings announced the coming of a
      tempest.

    </h5>
    <p>
      On a sudden this doomed man, who could no longer weep or smile, started
      with a shudder. No physical pain could reach him, and yet he pressed his
      hand hastily to his heart, as though he had experienced a cruel pang.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I feel it. This hour, many of those
      whom I love&mdash;the descendants of my dear sister&mdash;suffer, and are
      in great peril. Some in the centre of India&mdash;some in America&mdash;some
      here in Germany. The struggle recommences, the detestable passions are
      again awake. Oh, thou that hearest me&mdash;thou, like myself wandering
      and accursed&mdash;Herodias! help me to protect them! May my invocation
      reach thee, in those American solitudes where thou now lingerest&mdash;and
      may we arrive in time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereon an extraordinary event happened. Night was come. The man made a
      movement; precipitately, to retrace his steps&mdash;but an invisible force
      prevented him, and carried him forward in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the storm burst forth in its murky majesty. One of those
      whirlwinds, which tear up trees by the roots and shake the foundations of
      the rocks, rushed over the hill rapid and loud as thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the roaring of the hurricane, by the glare of the fiery
      flashes, the man with the black mark on his brow was seen descending the
      hill, stalking with huge strides among the rocks, and between trees bent
      beneath the efforts of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tread of this man was no longer slow, firm, and steady&mdash;but
      painfully irregular, like that of one impelled by an irresistible power,
      or carried along by the whirl of a frightful wind. In vain he extended his
      supplicating hands to heaven. Soon he disappeared in the shades of night,
      and amid the roar of the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) It is known that, according to the legend, the Wandering Jew was a
      shoemaker at Jerusalem. The Saviour, carrying his cross, passed before the
      house of the artisan, and asked him to be allowed to rest an instant on
      the stone bench at his door. &ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; said the Jew
      harshly, pushing him away. &ldquo;Thou shalt go on till the end of time,&rdquo;
      answered the Saviour, in a stern though sorrowful tone. For further
      details, see the eloquent and learned notice by Charles Magnin, appended
      to the magnificent poem &ldquo;Ahasuerus,&rdquo; by Ed. Quinet.&mdash;E.

      (3) According to a legend very little known, for we are indebted to the
      kindness of M. Maury, the learned sub-librarian of the Institute, Herodias
      was condemned to wander till the day of judgement, for having asked for
      the death of John the Baptist&mdash;E. S.

      CHAPTER XVII. THE AJOUPA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile Rodin
      despatched his cosmopolite correspondence, from his retreat in the Rue du
      Milieu des Ursins, in Paris&mdash;while the daughters of General Simon,
      after quitting as fugitives the White Falcon, were detained prisoners at
      Leipsic along with Dagobert&mdash;other scenes, deeply interesting to
      these different personages, were passing, almost as it were at the same
      moment, at the other extremity of the world, in the furthermost parts of
      Asia&mdash;that is to say, in the island of Java, not far from the city of
      Batavia, the residence of M. Joshua Van Dael, one of the correspondents of
      Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java! magnificent and fatal country, where the most admirable flowers
      conceal hideous reptiles, where the brightest fruits contain subtle
      poisons, where grow splendid trees, whose very shadow is death&mdash;where
      the gigantic vampire bat sucks the blood of its victims whilst it prolongs
      their sleep, by surrounding them with a fresh and balmy air, no fan moving
      so rapidly as the great perfumed wings of this monster!
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of October, 1831, draws near its close. It is noon&mdash;an hour
      well nigh mortal to him who encounters the fiery heat of the sun, which
      spreads a sheet of dazzling light over the deep blue enamel of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ajoupa, or hut, made of cane mats, suspended from long bamboos, which
      are driven far into the ground, rises in the midst of the bluish shadows
      cast by a tuft of trees, whose glittering verdure resembles green
      porcelain. These quaintly formed trees, rounded into arches, pointing like
      spires, overspreading like parasols, are so thick in foliage, so entangled
      one with the other, that their dome is impenetrable to the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soil, ever marshy, notwithstanding the insupportable heat, disappears
      beneath an inextricable mass of creepers, ferns, and tufted reeds, of a
      freshness and vigor of vegetation almost incredible, reaching nearly to
      the top of the ajoupa, which lies hid like a nest among the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more suffocating than the atmosphere, heavily laden with
      moist exhalations like the steam of hot water, and impregnated with the
      strongest and sharpest scents; for the cinnamon-tree, ginger-plant,
      stephanotis and Cape jasmine, mixed with these trees and creepers, spread
      around in puffs their penetrating odors. A roof, formed of large Indian
      fig-leaves, covers the cabin; at one end is a square opening, which serves
      for a window, shut in with a fine lattice-work of vegetable fibres, so as
      to prevent the reptiles and venomous insects from creeping into the
      ajoupa. The huge trunk of a dead tree, still standing, but much bent, and
      with its summit reaching to the roof of the ajoupa, rises from the midst
      of the brushwood. From every crevice in its black, rugged, mossy bark,
      springs a strange, almost fantastic flower; the wing of a butterfly is not
      of a finer tissue, of a more brilliant purple, of a more glossy black:
      those unknown birds we see in our dreams, have no more grotesque forms
      than these specimens of the orchis&mdash;winged flowers, that seem always
      ready to fly from their frail and leafless stalks. The long, flexible
      stems of the cactus, which might be taken for reptiles, encircle also this
      trunk, and clothe it with their bunches of silvery white, shaded inside
      with bright orange. These flowers emit a strong scent of vanilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      A serpent, of a brick-red, about the thickness of a large quill, and five
      or six inches long, half protrudes its flat head from one of those
      enormous, perfumed calyces, in which it lies closely curled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the ajoupa, a young man is extended on a mat in a profound sleep.
      His complexion of a clear golden yellow, gives him the appearance of a
      statue of pale bronze, on which a ray of sun is playing. His attitude is
      simple and graceful; his right arm sustains his head, a little raised and
      turned on one side; his ample robe of white muslin, with hanging sleeves,
      leaves uncovered his chest and arms worthy of the Antoinous. Marble is not
      more firm, more polished than his skin, the golden hue of which contracts
      strongly with the whiteness of his garments. Upon his broad manly chest a
      deep scar is visible&mdash;the mark of the musket-ball he received in
      defending the life of General Simon, the father of Rose and Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspended from his neck, he wears a medal similar to that in the
      possession of the two sisters. This Indian is Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      His features are at once very noble and very beautiful. His hair of a blue
      black, parted upon his forehead, falls waving, but not curled over his
      shoulders; whilst his eyebrows, boldly and yet delicately defined, are of
      as deep a jet as the long eyelashes, that cast their shadow upon his
      beardless cheek. His bright, red lips are slightly apart, and he breathes
      uneasily; his sleep is heavy and troubled, for the heat becomes every
      moment more and more suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without, the silence is profound. Not a breath of air is stirring. Yet now
      the tall ferns, which cover the soil, begin to move almost imperceptibly,
      as though their stems were shaken by the slow progress of some crawling
      body. From time to time, this trifling oscillation suddenly ceases, and
      all is again motionless. But, after several of these alternations of
      rustling and deep silence, a human head appears in the midst of the
      jungle, a little distance from the trunk of the dead tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom it belonged was possessed of a grim countenance, with a
      complexion the color of greenish bronze, long black hair bound about his
      temples, eyes brilliant with savage fire, and an expression remarkable for
      its intelligence and ferocity. Holding his breath, he remained quite still
      for a moment; then, advancing upon his hands and knees, pushing aside the
      leaves so gently, that not the slightest noise could be heard, he arrived
      cautiously and slowly at the trunk of the dead tree, the summit of which
      nearly touched the roof of the ajoupa.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, of Malay origin, belonging to the sect of the Lughardars
      (Stranglers), after having again listened, rose almost entirely from
      amongst the brushwood. With the exception of white cotton drawers,
      fastened around his middle by a parti-colored sash, he was completely
      naked. His bronze, supple, and nervous limbs were overlaid with a thick
      coat of oil. Stretching himself along the huge trunk on the side furthest
      from the cabin, and thus sheltered by the whole breadth of the tree with
      its surrounding creepers, he began to climb silently, with as much
      patience as caution. In the undulations of his form, in the flexibility of
      his movements, in the restrained vigor, which fully put forth would have
      been alarming, there was some resemblance to the stealthy and treacherous
      advance of the tiger upon its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached, completely unperceived, the inclined portion of the tree,
      which almost touched the roof of the cabin, he was only separated from the
      window by a distance of about a foot. Cautiously advancing his head, he
      looked down into the interior, to see how he might best find an entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Djalma in his deep sleep, the Thug&rsquo;s bright eyes
      glittered with increased brilliancy; a nervous contraction, or rather a
      mute, ferocious laugh, curling the corners of his mouth, drew them up
      towards the cheekbones, and exposed rows of teeth, filed sharp like the
      points of a saw, and dyed of a shining black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma was lying in such a manner and so near the door of the ajoupa,
      which opened inwards, that, were it moved in the least, he must be
      instantly awakened. The Strangler, with his body still sheltered by the
      tree, wishing to examine more attentively the interior of the cabin,
      leaned very forward, and in order to maintain his balance, lightly rested
      his hand on the ledge of the opening that served for a window. This
      movement shook the large cactus-flowers, within which the little serpent
      lay curled, and, darting forth it twisted itself rapidly round the wrist
      of the Strangler. Whether from pain or surprise, the man uttered a low
      cry; and as he drew back swiftly, still holding by the trunk of the tree,
      he perceived that Djalma had moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Indian, though retaining his supine posture, had half opened his
      eyes, and turned his head towards the window, whilst his breast heaved
      with a deep-drawn sigh, for, beneath that thick dome of moist verdure, the
      concentrated heat was intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he moved, when, from behind the tree, was heard the shrill,
      brief, sonorous note, which the bird of paradise titters when it takes its
      flight&mdash;a cry which resembles that of the pheasant. This note was
      soon repeated, but more faintly, as though the brilliant bird were already
      at a distance. Djalma, thinking he had discovered the cause of the noise
      which had aroused him for an instant, stretched out the arm upon which his
      head had rested, and went to sleep again, with scarcely any change of
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes, the most profound silence once more reigned in this
      solitude, and everything remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Strangler, by his skillful imitation of the bird, had repaired the
      imprudence of that exclamation of surprise and pain, which the reptile
      bite had forced from him. When he thought all was safe, he again advanced
      his head, and saw the young Indian once more plunged in sleep. Then he
      descended the tree with the same precautions, though his left hand was
      somewhat swollen from the sting of the serpent, and disappeared in the
      jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a song of monotonous and melancholy cadence was heard in
      the distance. The Strangler raised himself, and listened attentively, and
      his face took an expression of surprise and deadly anger. The song came
      nearer and nearer to the cabin, and, in a few seconds, an Indian, passing
      through an open space in the jungle, approached the spot where the Thug
      lay concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter unwound from his waist a long thin cord, to one of the ends of
      which was attached a leaden ball, of the form and size of an egg; having
      fastened the other end of this cord to his right wrist, the Strangler
      again listened, and then disappeared, crawling through the tall grass in
      the direction of the Indian, who still advanced slowly, without
      interrupting his soft and plaintive song.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a young fellow scarcely twenty, with a bronzed complexion, the
      slave of Djalma, his vest of blue cotton was confined at the waist by a
      parti-colored sash; he wore a red turban, and silver rings in his ears and
      about his wrists. He was bringing a message to his master, who, during the
      great heat of the day was reposing in the ajoupa, which stood at some
      distance from the house he inhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at a place where two paths separated, the slave, without
      hesitation took that which led to the cabin, from which he was now scarce
      forty paces distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those enormous Java butterflies, whose wings extend six or eight
      inches in length, and offer to the eye two streaks of gold on a ground of
      ultramarine, fluttering from leaf to leaf, alighted on a bush of Cape
      jasmine, within the reach of the young Indian. The slave stopped in his
      song, stood still, advanced first a foot, then a hand, and seized the
      butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he sees a dark figure rise before him; he hears a whizzing noise
      like that of a sling; he feels a cord, thrown with as much rapidity as
      force, encircle his neck with a triple band; and, almost in the same
      instant, the leaden ball strikes violently against the back of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack was so abrupt and unforseen, that Djalma&rsquo;s servant could
      not even utter a single cry, a single groan. He tottered&mdash;the
      Strangler gave a vigorous pull at the cord&mdash;the bronzed countenance
      of the slave became purple, and he fell upon his knees, convulsively
      moving his arms. Then the Strangler threw him quite down, and pulled the
      cord so violently, that the blood spurted from the skin. The victim
      struggled for a moment&mdash;and all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his short but intense agony, the murderer, kneeling before his
      victim, and watching with ardent eye his least convulsions, seemed plunged
      into an ecstasy of ferocious joy. His nostrils dilated, the veins of his
      neck and temples were swollen, and the same savage laugh, which had curled
      his lips at the aspect of the sleeping Djalma, again displayed his pointed
      black teeth, which a nervous trembling of the jaws made to chatter. But
      soon he crossed his arms upon his heaving breast, bowed his forehead, and
      murmured some mysterious words, which sounded like an invocation or a
      prayer. Immediately after, he returned to the contemplation of the dead
      body. The hyena and the tiger-cat, who, before devouring, crouch beside
      the prey that they have surprised or hunted down, have not a wilder or
      more sanguinary look than this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, remembering that his task was not yet accomplished tearing himself
      unwillingly from the hideous spectacle, he unbound the cord from the neck
      of his victim, fastened it round his own body, dragged the corpse out of
      the path, and, without attempting to rob it of its silver rings, concealed
      it in a thick part of the jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Strangler again began to creep on his knees and belly, till he
      arrived at the cabin of Djalma&mdash;that cabin constructed of mats
      suspended from bamboos. After listening attentively, he drew from his
      girdle a knife, the sharp-pointed blade of which was wrapped in a
      fig-leaf, and made in the matting an incision of three feet in length.
      This was done with such quickness, and with so fine a blade, that the
      light touch of the diamond cutting glass would have made more noise.
      Seeing, by means of this opening, which was to serve him for a passage,
      that Djalma was still fast asleep, the Thug, with incredible temerity,
      glided into the cabin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. THE TATTOOING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he heavens, which
      had been till now of transparent blue, became gradually of a greenish
      tint, and the sun was veiled in red, lurid vapor. This strange light gave
      to every object a weird appearance, of which one might form an idea, by
      looking at a landscape through a piece of copper colored glass. In those
      climates, this phenomenon, when united with an increase of burning heat,
      always announces the approach of a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time there was a passing odor of sulphur; then the leaves,
      slightly shaken by electric currents, would tremble upon their stalks;
      till again all would return to the former motionless silence. The weight
      of the burning atmosphere, saturated with sharp perfumes, became almost
      intolerable. Large drops of sweat stood in pearls on the forehead of
      Djalma, still plunged in enervating sleep&mdash;for it no longer resembled
      rest, but a painful stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Strangler glided like a reptile along the sides of the ajoupa, and,
      crawling on his belly, arrived at the sleeping-mat of Djalma, beside which
      he squatted himself, so as to occupy as little space as possible. Then
      began a fearful scene, by reason of the mystery and silence which
      surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma&rsquo;s life was at the mercy of the Strangler. The latter, resting
      upon his hands and knees, with his neck stretched forward, his eye fixed
      and dilated, continued motionless as a wild beast about to spring. Only a
      slight nervous trembling of the jaws agitated that mask of bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon his hideous features revealed a violent struggle that was passing
      within him&mdash;a struggle between the thirst, the craving for the
      enjoyment of murder, which the recent assassination of the slave had made
      still more active, and the orders he had received not to attempt the life
      of Djalma, though the design, which brought him to the ajoupa, might
      perhaps be as fatal to the young Indian as death itself. Twice did the
      Strangler, with look of flame, resting only on his left hand, seize with
      his right the rope&rsquo;s end; and twice his hand fell&mdash;the instinct
      of murder yielding to a powerful will, of which the Malay acknowledged the
      irresistible empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In him, the homicidal craving must have amounted to madness, for, in these
      hesitations, he lost much precious time: at any moment, Djalma, whose
      vigor, skill, and courage were known and feared, might awake from his
      sleep, and, though unarmed, he would prove a terrible adversary. At length
      the Thug made up his mind; with a suppressed sigh of regret, he set about
      accomplishing his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      This task would have appeared impossible to any one else. The reader may
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma, with his face turned towards the left, leaned his head upon his
      curved arm. It was first necessary, without waking him, to oblige him to
      turn his face towards the right (that is, towards the door), so that, in
      case of his being half-roused, his first glance might not fall upon the
      Strangler. The latter, to accomplish his projects, would have to remain
      many minutes in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavens became darker; the heat arrived at its last degree of
      intensity; everything combined to increase the torpor of the sleeper, and
      so favor the Strangler&rsquo;s designs. Kneeling down close to Djalma, he
      began, with the tips of his supple, well-oiled fingers, to stroke the
      brow, temples, and eyelids of the young Indian, but with such extreme
      lightness, that the contact of the two skins was hardly sensible. When
      this kind of magnetic incantation had lasted for some seconds, the sweat,
      which bathed the forehead of Djalma, became more abundant: he heaved a
      smothered sigh, and the muscles of his face gave several twitches, for the
      strokings, although too light to rouse him, yet caused in him a feeling of
      indefinable uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching him with his restless and burning eye, the Strangler continued
      his maneuvers with so much patience, that Djalma, still sleeping, but no
      longer able to bear this vague, annoying sensation, raised his right hand
      mechanically to his face, as if he would have brushed away an importunate
      insect. But he had not strength to do it; almost immediately after, his
      hand, inert and heavy, fell back upon his chest. The Strangler saw, by
      this symptom, that he was attaining his object, and continued to stroke,
      with the same address, the eyelids, brow, and temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Djalma, more and more oppressed by heavy sleep, and having
      neither strength nor will to raise his hand to his face, mechanically
      turned round his head, which fell languidly upon his right shoulder,
      seeking by this change of attitude, to escape from the disagreeable
      sensation which pursued him. The first point gained, the Strangler could
      act more freely.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10179m.jpg" alt="10179m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10179.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      To render as profound as possible the sleep he had half interrupted, he
      now strove to imitate the vampire, and, feigning the action of a fan, he
      rapidly moved his extended hands about the burning face of the young
      Indian. Alive to a feeling of such sudden and delicious coolness, in the
      height of suffocating heat, the countenance of Djalma brightened, his
      bosom heaved, his half-opened lips drank in the grateful air, and he fell
      into a sleep only the more invincible, because it had been at first
      disturbed, and was now yielded to under the influence of a pleasing
      sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flash of lightning illumined the shady dome that sheltered the
      ajoupa: fearing that the first clap of thunder might rouse the young
      Indian, the Strangler hastened to complete his Task. Djalma lay on his
      back, with his head resting on his right shoulder, and his left arm
      extended; the Thug, crouching at his left side, ceased by degrees the
      process of fanning; then, with incredible dexterity, he succeeded in
      rolling up, above the elbow, the long wide sleeve of white muslin that
      covered the left arm of the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next drew from the pocket of his drawers a copper box, from which he
      took a very fine, sharp-pointed needle, and a piece of a black-looking
      root. He pricked this root several times with the needle, and on each
      occasion there issued from it a white, glutinous liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Strangler thought the needle sufficiently impregnated with this
      juice, he bent down, and began to blow gently over the inner surface of
      Djalma&rsquo;s arm, so as to cause a fresh sensation of coolness; then,
      with the point of his needle, he traced almost imperceptibly on the skin
      of the sleeping youth some mysterious and symbolical signs. All this was
      performed so cleverly and the point of the needle was so fine and keen,
      that Djalma did not feel the action of the acid upon the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signs, which the Strangler had traced, soon appeared on the surface,
      at first in characters of a pale rose-color, as fine as a hair; but such
      was the slowly corrosive power of the juice, that, as it worked and spread
      beneath the skin, they would become in a few hours of a violet red, and as
      apparent as they were now almost invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Strangler, having so perfectly succeeded in his project, threw a last
      look of ferocious longing on the slumbering Indian, and creeping away from
      the mat, regained the opening by which he had entered the cabin; next,
      closely uniting the edges of the incision, so as to obviate all suspicion,
      he disappeared just as the thunder began to rumble hoarsely in the
      distance.(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) We read in the letters of the late Victor Jacquemont upon India, with
      regard to the incredible dexterity of these men: &ldquo;They crawl on the
      ground, ditches, in the furrows of fields, imitate a hundred different
      voices, and dissipate the effect of any accidental noise by raising the
      yelp of the jackal or note of some bird&mdash;then are silent, and another
      imitates the call of the same animal in the distance. They can molest a
      sleeper by all sorts of noises and slight touches, and make his body and
      limbs take any position which suits their purpose.&rdquo; Count Edward de
      Warren, in his excellent work on English India, which we shall have again
      occasion to quote, expresses himself in the same manner as to the
      inconceivable address of the Indians: &ldquo;They have the art,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;to rob you, without interrupting your sleep, of the very
      sheet in which you are enveloped. This is not &lsquo;a traveller&rsquo;s
      tale.&rsquo; but a fact. The movements of the bheel are those of the
      serpent. If you sleep in your tent, with a servant lying across each
      entrance, the bheel will come and crouch on the outside, in some shady
      corner, where he can hear the breathing of those within. As soon as the
      European sleeps, he feels sure of success, for the Asiatic will not long
      resist the attraction of repose. At the proper moment, he makes a vertical
      incision in the cloth of the tent, on the spot where he happens to be, and
      just large enough to admit him. He glides through like a phantom, without
      making the least grain of sand creak beneath his tread. He is perfectly
      naked, and all his body is rubbed over with oil; a two-edged knife is
      suspended from his neck. He will squat down close to your couch, and, with
      incredible coolness and dexterity, will gather up the sheet in very little
      folds, so as to occupy the least surface possible; then, passing to the
      other side, he will lightly tickle the sleeper, whom he seems to
      magnetize, till the latter shrinks back involuntarily, and ends by turning
      round, and leaving the sheet folded behind him. Should he awake, and
      strive to seize the robber, he catches at a slippery form, which slides
      through his hands like an eel; should he even succeed in seizing him, it
      would be fatal&mdash;the dagger strikes him to the heart, he falls bathed
      in his blood, and the assassin disappears.&rdquo;&mdash;E. S.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE SMUGGLER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he tempest of the
      morning has long been over. The sun is verging towards the horizon. Some
      hours have elapsed, since the Strangler introduced himself into Djalma&rsquo;s
      cabin, and tattooed him with a mysterious sign during his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horseman advances rapidly down a long avenue of spreading trees.
      Sheltered by the thick and verdant arch, a thousand birds salute the
      splendid evening with songs and circlings; red and green parrots climb, by
      help of their hooked beaks, to the top of pink-blossomed acacias; large
      Morea birds of the finest and richest blue, whose throats and long tails
      change in the light to a golden brown, are chasing the prince oriels,
      clothed in their glossy feathers of black and orange; Kolo doves, of a
      changeable violet hue, are gently cooing by the side of the birds of
      paradise, in whose brilliant plumage are mingled the prismatic colors of
      the emerald and ruby, the topaz and sapphire.
    </p>
    <p>
      This avenue, a little raised, commanded a view of a small pond, which
      reflected at intervals the green shade of tamarind trees. In the calm,
      limpid waters, many fish were visible, some with silver scales and purple
      fins, others gleaming with azure and vermilion; so still were they that
      they looked as if set in a mass of bluish crystal, and, as they dwelt
      motionless near the surface of the pool, on which played a dazzling ray of
      the sun, they revelled in the enjoyment of the light and heat. A thousand
      insects&mdash;living gems, with wings of flame&mdash;glided, fluttered and
      buzzed over the transparent wave, in which, at an extraordinary depth,
      were mirrored the variegated tints of the aquatic plants on the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the exuberant nature of this
      scene, luxuriant in the sunlight, colors, and perfumes, which served, so
      to speak, as a frame to the young and brilliant rider, who was advancing
      along the avenue. It was Djalma. He had not yet perceived the indelible
      marks, which the Strangler had traced upon his left arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Japanese mare, of slender make, full of fire and vigor, is black as
      night. A narrow red cloth serves instead of saddle. To moderate the
      impetuous bounds of the animal, Djalma uses a small steel bit, with
      headstall and reins of twisted scarlet silk, fine as a thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of those admirable riders, sculptured so masterly on the frieze of
      the Parthenon, sits his horse more gracefully and proudly than this young
      Indian, whose fine face, illumined by the setting sun, is radiant with
      serene happiness; his eyes sparkle with joy, and his dilated nostrils and
      unclosed lips inhale with delight the balmy breeze, that brings to him the
      perfume of flowers and the scent of fresh leaves, for the trees are still
      moist from the abundant rain that fell after the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A red cap, similar to that worn by the Greeks, surmounting the black locks
      of Djalma, sets off to advantage the golden tint of his complexion; his
      throat is bare; he is clad in his robe of white muslin with large sleeves,
      confined at the waist by a scarlet sash; very full drawers, in white
      cotton stuff, leave half uncovered his tawny and polished legs; their
      classic curve stands out from the dark sides of the horse, which he
      presses tightly between his muscular calves. He has no stirrups; his foot,
      small and narrow, is shod with a sandal of morocco leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rush of his thoughts, by turns impetuous and restrained, was expressed
      in some degree by the pace he imparted to his horse&mdash;now bold and
      precipitate, like the flight of unbridled imagination&mdash;now calm and
      measured, like the reflection which succeeds an idle dream. But, in all
      this fantastic course, his least movements were distinguished by a proud,
      independent and somewhat savage grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dispossessed of his paternal territory by the English, and at first
      detained by them as a state-prisoner after the death of his father&mdash;who
      (as M. Joshua Van Dael had written to M. Rodin) had fallen sword in hand&mdash;Djalma
      had at length been restored to liberty. Abandoning the continent of India,
      and still accompanied by General Simon, who had lingered hard by the
      prison of his old friend&rsquo;s son, the young Indian came next to
      Batavia, the birthplace of his mother, to collect the modest inheritance
      of his maternal ancestors. And amongst this property, so long despised or
      forgotten by his father, he found some important papers, and a medal
      exactly similar to that worn by Rose and Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Simon was not more surprised than pleased at this discovery, which
      not only established a tie of kindred between his wife and Djalma&rsquo;s
      mother, but which also seemed to promise great advantages for the future.
      Leaving Djalma at Batavia, to terminate some business there, he had gone
      to the neighboring island of Sumatra, in the hope of finding a vessel that
      would make the passage to Europe directly and rapidly; for it was now
      necessary that, cost what it might, the young Indian also should be at
      Paris on the 13th February, 1832. Should General Simon find a vessel ready
      to sail for Europe, he was to return immediately, to fetch Djalma; and the
      latter, expecting him daily, was now going to the pier of Batavia, hoping
      to see the father of Rose and Blanche arrive by the mail boat from
      Sumatra.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words are here necessary on the early life of the son of Kadja sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having lost his mother very young, and brought up with rude simplicity, he
      had accompanied his father, whilst yet a child, to the great tiger hunts,
      as dangerous as battles; and, in the first dawn of youth, he had followed
      him to the stern bloody war, which he waged in defence of his country.
      Thus living, from the time of his mother&rsquo;s death, in the midst of
      forests and mountains and continual combats, his vigorous and ingenuous
      nature had preserved itself pure, and he well merited the name of &ldquo;The
      Generous&rdquo; bestowed on him. Born a prince, he was&mdash;which by no
      means follows&mdash;a prince indeed. During the period of his captivity,
      the silent dignity of his bearing had overawed his jailers. Never a
      reproach, never a complaint&mdash;a proud and melancholy calm was all that
      he opposed to a treatment as unjust as it was barbarous, until he was
      restored to freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus been always accustomed to a patriarchal life, or to a war of
      mountaineers, which he had only quitted to pass a few months in prison,
      Djalma knew nothing, so to speak, of civilized society. Without its
      exactly amounting to a defect, he certainly carried his good qualities to
      their extreme limits. Obstinately faithful to his pledged word, devoted to
      the death, confiding to blindness, good almost to a complete forgetfulness
      of himself, he was inflexible towards ingratitude, falsehood, or perfidy.
      He would have felt no compunction to sacrifice a traitor, because, could
      he himself have committed a treason, he would have thought it only just to
      expiate it with his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, in a word, the man of natural feelings, absolute and entire. Such
      a man, brought into contact with the temperaments, calculations,
      falsehoods, deceptions, tricks, restrictions, and hollowness of a refined
      society, such as Paris, for example, would, without doubt, form a very
      curious subject for speculation. We raise this hypothesis, because, since
      his journey to France had been determined on, Djalma had one fixed, ardent
      desire&mdash;to be in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris&mdash;that enchanted city&mdash;of which, even in Asia, the land
      of enchantment, so many marvelous tales were told.
    </p>
    <p>
      What chiefly inflamed the fresh, vivid imagination of the young Indian,
      was the thought of French women&mdash;those attractive Parisian beauties,
      miracles of elegance and grace, who eclipsed, he was informed, even the
      magnificence of the capitals of the civilized world. And at this very
      moment, in the brightness of that warm and splendid evening, surrounded by
      the intoxication of flowers and perfumes, which accelerated the pulses of
      his young fiery heart, Djalma was dreaming of those exquisite creatures,
      whom his fancy loved to clothe in the most ideal garbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him as if, at the end of the avenue, in the midst of that
      sheet of golden light, which the trees encompassed with their full, green
      arch, he could see pass and repass, white and sylph-like, a host of
      adorable and voluptuous phantoms, that threw him kisses from the tips of
      their rosy fingers. Unable to restrain his burning emotions, carried away
      by a strange enthusiasm, Djalma uttered exclamations of joy, deep, manly,
      and sonorous, and made his vigorous courser bound under him in the
      excitement of a mad delight. Just then a sunbeam, piercing the dark vault
      of the avenue, shone full upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several minutes, a man had been advancing rapidly along a path, which,
      at its termination, intersected the avenue diagonally. He stopped a moment
      in the shade, looking at Djalma with astonishment. It was indeed a
      charming sight, to behold, in the midst of a blaze of dazzling lustre,
      this youth, so handsome, joyous, and ardent, clad in his white and flowing
      vestments, gayly and lightly seated on his proud black mare, who covered
      her red bridle with her foam, and whose long tail and thick mane floated
      on the evening breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, with that reaction which takes place in all human desires, Djalma
      soon felt stealing over him a sentiment of soft, undefinable melancholy.
      He raised his hand to his eyes, now dimmed with moisture, and allowed the
      reins to fall on the mane of his docile steed, which, instantly stopping,
      stretched out its long neck, and turned its head in the direction of the
      personage, whom it could see approaching through the coppice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, Mahal the Smuggler, was dressed nearly like European sailors. He
      wore jacket and trousers of white duck, a broad red sash, and a very
      low-crowned straw hat. His face was brown, with strongly-marked features,
      and, though forty years of age, he was quite beardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment, Mahal was close to the young Indian. &ldquo;You are
      Prince Djalma?&rdquo; said he, in not very good French, raising his hand
      respectfully to his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you?&rdquo; said the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the son of Kadja-sing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once again, what would you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The friend of General Simon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Simon?&rdquo; cried Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to meet him, as you have gone every evening, since
      you expect his return from Sumatra?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but how do you know all this?&rdquo; said the Indian looking
      at the Smuggler with as much surprise as curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not to land at Batavia, to-day or to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sent by him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mahal, with a distrustful air. &ldquo;But are
      you really the son of Kadja-sing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I tell you&mdash;but where have you seen General Simon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are the son of Kadja-sing,&rdquo; resumed Mahal, continuing
      to regard Djalma with a suspicious eye, &ldquo;what is your surname?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sire was called the &lsquo;Father of the Generous,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      answered the young Indian, as a shade of sorrow passed over his fine
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words appeared in part to convince Mahal of the identity of Djalma;
      but, wishing doubtless to be still more certain, he resumed: &ldquo;You
      must have received, two days ago, a letter from General Simon, written
      from Sumatra?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but why so many questions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To assure myself that you are really the son of Kadja-sing, and to
      execute the orders I have received.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From General Simon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have proof that you are Prince Djalma, I will tell you. I
      was informed that you would be mounted on a black mare, with a red bridle.
      But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the soul of my mother! speak what you have to say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all&mdash;if you can tell me what was the printed
      paper, contained in the last letter that General Simon wrote you from
      Sumatra.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a cutting from a French newspaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it announce good or bad news for the general?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news&mdash;for it related that, during his absence, they had
      acknowledged the last rank and title bestowed on him by the Emperor, as
      they had done for others of his brothers in arms, exiled like him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are indeed Prince Djalma,&rdquo; said the Smuggler, after a
      moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;I may speak. General Simon landed last
      night in Java, but on a desert part of the coast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a desert part?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has to hide himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hide himself!&rdquo; exclaimed Djalma, in amazement; &ldquo;why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is he?&rdquo; asked Djalma, growing pale with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is three leagues hence&mdash;near the sea-shore&mdash;in the
      ruins of Tchandi.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obliged to hide himself!&rdquo; repeated Djalma, and his
      countenance expressed increasing surprise and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without being certain, I think it is because of a duel he fought in
      Sumatra,&rdquo; said the Smuggler, mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A duel&mdash;with whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I am not at all certain on the subject.
      But do you know the ruins of Tchandi?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general expects you there; that is what he ordered me to tell
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you came with him from Sumatra?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was pilot of the little smuggling coaster, that landed him in the
      night on a lonely beach. He knew that you went every day to the mole, to
      wait for him; I was almost sure that I should meet you. He gave me details
      about the letter you received from him as a proof that he had sent me. If
      he could have found the means of writing, he would have written.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did not tell you why he was obliged to hide himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me nothing. Certain words made me suspect what I told you&mdash;a
      duel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing the mettle of General Simon, Djalma thought the suspicions of the
      Smuggler not unfounded. After a moment&rsquo;s silence he said to him:
      &ldquo;Can you undertake to lead home my horse? My dwelling is without the
      town&mdash;there, in the midst of those trees&mdash;by the side of the new
      mosque. In ascending the mountain of Tchandi, my horse would be in my way;
      I shall go much faster on foot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where you live; General Simon told me. I should have gone
      there if I had not met you. Give me your horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma sprang lightly to the ground, threw the bridle to Mahal, unrolled
      one end of his sash, took out a silk purse, and gave it to the Smuggler,
      saying: &ldquo;You have been faithful and obedient. Here!&mdash;it is a
      trifle&mdash;but I have no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kadja-sing was rightly called the &lsquo;Father of the Generous,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      said the Smuggler, bowing with respect and gratitude. He took the road to
      Batavia, leading Djalma&rsquo;s horse. The young Indian, on the contrary,
      plunged into the coppice, and, walking with great strides, he directed his
      course towards the mountain, on which were the ruins of Tchandi, where he
      could not arrive before night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. M. JOSHUA VAN DAEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. Joshua Van Dael
      a Dutch merchant, and correspondent of M. Rodin, was born at Batavia, the
      capital of the island of Java; his parents had sent him to be educated at
      Pondicherry, in a celebrated religious house, long established in that
      place, and belonging to the &ldquo;Society of Jesus.&rdquo; It was there
      that he was initiated into the order as &ldquo;professor of the three
      vows,&rdquo; or lay member, commonly called &ldquo;temporal coadjutor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua was a man of probity that passed for stainless; of strict accuracy
      in business, cold, careful, reserved, and remarkably skillful and
      sagacious; his financial operations were almost always successful, for a
      protecting power gave him ever in time, knowledge of events which might
      advantageously influence his commercial transactions. The religious house
      of Pondicherry was interested in his affairs, having charged him with the
      exportation and exchange of the produce of its large possessions in this
      colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking little, hearing much, never disputing, polite in the extreme&mdash;giving
      seldom, but with choice and purpose&mdash;Joshua, without inspiring
      sympathy, commanded generally that cold respect, which is always paid to
      the rigid moralist; for instead of yielding to the influence of lax and
      dissolute colonial manners, he appeared to live with great regularity, and
      his exterior had something of austerity about it, which tended to overawe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following scene took place at Batavia, while Djalma was on his way to
      the ruins of Tchandi in the hope of meeting General Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Joshua had just retired into his cabinet, in which were many shelves
      filled with paper boxes, and huge ledgers and cash boxes lying open upon
      desks. The only window of this apartment, which was on the ground floor,
      looked out upon a narrow empty court, and was protected externally by
      strong iron bars; instead of glass, it was fitted with a Venetian blind,
      because of the extreme heat of the climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Joshua, having placed upon his desk a taper in a glass globe, looked at
      the clock. &ldquo;Half-past nine,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mahal ought soon
      to be here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he went out, passing through an antechamber, opened a second
      thick door, studded with nail-heads, in the Dutch fashion, cautiously
      entered the court (so as not to be heard by the people in the house), and
      drew back the secret bolt of a gate six feet high, formidably garnished
      with iron spikes. Leaving this gate unfastened, he regained his cabinet,
      after he had successively and carefully closed the two other doors behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Joshua next seated himself at his desk, and took from a drawer a long
      letter, or rather statement, commenced some time before, and continued day
      by day. It is superfluous to observe, that the letter already mentioned,
      as addressed to M. Rodin, was anterior to the liberation of Djalma and his
      arrival at Batavia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present statement was also addressed to M. Rodin, and Van Dael thus
      went on with it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fearing the return of General Simon, of which I had been informed
      by intercepting his letters&mdash;I have already told you, that I had
      succeeded in being employed by him as his agent here; having then read his
      letters, and sent them on as if untouched to Djalma, I felt myself
      obliged, from the pressure of the circumstances, to have recourse to
      extreme measures&mdash;taking care always to preserve appearances, and
      rendering at the same time a signal service to humanity, which last reason
      chiefly decided me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new danger imperiously commanded these measures. The steamship
      &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo; came in yesterday, and sails tomorrow in the course
      of the day. She is to make the voyage to Europe via the Arabian Gulf; her
      passengers will disembark at Suez, cross the Isthmus, and go on board
      another vessel at Alexandria, which will bring them to France. This
      voyage, as rapid as it is direct, will not take more than seven or eight
      weeks. We are now at the end of October; Prince Djalma might then be in
      France by the commencement of the month of January; and according to your
      instructions, of which I know not the motive, but which I execute with
      zeal and submission, his departure must be prevented at all hazards,
      because, you tell me, some of the gravest interests of the Society would
      be compromised, by the arrival of this young Indian in Paris before the
      13th of February. Now, if I succeed, as I hope, in making him miss this
      opportunity of the &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo; it will be materially impossible
      for him to arrive in France before the month of April; for the &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo;
      is the only vessel which makes the direct passage, the others taking at
      least four or five months to reach Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before telling you the means which I have thought right to employ,
      to detain Prince Djalma&mdash;of the success of which means I am yet
      uncertain&mdash;it is well that you should be acquainted with the
      following facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have just discovered, in British India, a community whose
      members call themselves &lsquo;Brothers of the Good Work,&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;Phansegars,&rsquo; which signifies simply &lsquo;Thugs&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;Stranglers;&rsquo; these murderers do not shed blood, but strangle
      their victims, less for the purpose of robbing them, than in obedience to
      a homicidal vocation, and to the laws of an infernal divinity named by
      them &lsquo;Bowanee.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot better give you an idea of this horrible sect, than by
      transcribing here some lines from the introduction of a report by Colonel
      Sleeman, who has hunted out this dark association with indefatigable zeal.
      The report in question was published about two months ago. Here is the
      extract; it is the colonel who speaks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;From 1822 to 1824, when I was charged with the magistracy
      and civil administration of the district of Nersingpore, not a murder, not
      the least robbery was committed by an ordinary criminal, without my being
      immediately informed of it; but if any one had come and told me at this
      period, that a band of hereditary assassins by profession lived in the
      village of Kundelie, within about four hundred yards of my court of
      justice&mdash;that the beautiful groves of the village of Mundesoor,
      within a day&rsquo;s march of my residence, formed one of the most
      frightful marts of assassination in all India&mdash;that numerous bands of
      &lsquo;Brothers of the Good Work,&rsquo; coming from Hindostan and the
      Deccan, met annually beneath these shades, as at a solemn festival, to
      exercise their dreadful vocation upon all the roads which cross each other
      in this locality&mdash;I should have taken such a person for a madman, or
      one who had been imposed upon by idle tales. And yet nothing could be
      truer; hundreds of travellers had been buried every year in the groves of
      Mundesoor; a whole tribe of assassins lived close to my door, at the very
      time I was supreme magistrate of the province, and extended their
      devastations to the cities of Poonah and Hyderabad. I shall never forget,
      when, to convince me of the fact, one of the chiefs of the Stranglers, who
      had turned informer against them, caused thirteen bodies to be dug up from
      the ground beneath my tent, and offered to produce any number from the
      soil in the immediate vicinity.&lsquo;(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These few words of Colonel Sleeman will give some idea of this
      dread society, which has its laws, duties, customs, opposed to all other
      laws, human and divine. Devoted to each other, even to heroism, blindly
      obedient to their chiefs, who profess themselves the immediate
      representatives of their dark divinity, regarding as enemies all who do
      not belong to them, gaining recruits everywhere by a frightful system of
      proselytising&mdash;these apostles of a religion of murder go preaching
      their abominable doctrines in the shade, and spreading their immense net
      over the whole of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three of their principal chiefs, and one of their adepts, flying
      from the determined pursuit of the English governor-general, having
      succeeded in making their escape, had arrived at the Straits of Malacca,
      at no great distance from our island; a smuggler, who is also something of
      a pirate, attached to their association, and by name Mahal, took them on
      board his coasting vessel, and brought them hither, where they think
      themselves for some time in safety&mdash;as, following the advice of the
      smuggler, they lie concealed in a thick forest, in which are many ruined
      temples and numerous subterranean retreats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amongst these chiefs, all three remarkably intelligent, there is
      one in particular, named Faringhea, whose extraordinary energy and eminent
      qualities make him every way redoubtable. He is of the mixed race, half
      white and Hindoo, has long inhabited towns in which are European factories
      and speaks English and French very well. The other two chiefs are a Negro
      and a Hindoo; the adept is a Malay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smuggler, Mahal, considering that he could obtain a large
      reward by giving up these three chiefs and their adept, came to me,
      knowing, as all the world knows, my intimate relations with a person who
      has great influence with our governor. Two days ago, he offered me, on
      certain conditions, to deliver up the Negro, the half-caste, the Hindoo,
      and the Malay. These conditions are&mdash;a considerable sum of money, and
      a free passage on board a vessel sailing for Europe or America, in order
      to escape the implacable vengeance of the Thugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I joyfully seized the occasion to hand over three such murderers to
      human justice, and I promised Mahal to arrange matters for him with the
      governor, but also on certain conditions, innocent in themselves, and
      which concerned Djalma. Should my project succeed, I will explain myself
      more at length; I shall soon know the result, for I expect Mahal every
      minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before I close these despatches, which are to go tomorrow by
      the &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo;&mdash;in which vessel I have also engaged a
      passage for Mahal the Smuggler, in the event of the success of my plans&mdash;I
      must include in parentheses a subject of some importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my last letter, in which I announced to you the death of Djalma&rsquo;s
      father, and his own imprisonment by the English, I asked for some
      information as to the solvency of Baron Tripeaud, banker and manufacturer
      at Paris, who has also an agency at Calcutta. This information will now be
      useless, if what I have just learned should, unfortunately, turn out to be
      correct, and it will be for you to act according to circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house at Calcutta owes considerable sums both to me and our
      colleague at Pondicherry, and it is said that M. Tripeaud has involved
      himself to a dangerous extent in attempting to ruin, by opposition, a very
      flourishing establishment, founded some time ago by M. Francois Hardy, an
      eminent manufacturer. I am assured that M. Tripeaud has already sunk and
      lost a large capital in this enterprise: he has no doubt done a great deal
      of harm to M. Francois Hardy; but he has also, they say, seriously
      compromised his own fortune&mdash;and, were he to fail, the effects of his
      disaster would be very fatal to us, seeing that he owes a large sum of
      money to me and to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this state of things it would be very desirable if, by the
      employment of the powerful means of every kind at our disposal, we could
      completely discredit and break down the house of M. Francois Hardy,
      already shaken by M. Tripeaud&rsquo;s violent opposition. In that case,
      the latter would soon regain all he has lost; the ruin of his rival would
      insure his prosperity, and our demands would be securely covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, it is painful, it is sad, to be obliged to have recourse
      to these extreme measures, only to get back our own; but, in these days,
      are we not surely justified in sometimes using the arms that are
      incessantly turned against us? If we are reduced to such steps by the
      injustice and wickedness of men, we may console ourselves with the
      reflection that we only seek to preserve our worldly possessions, in order
      to devote them to the greater glory of God; whilst, in the hands of our
      enemies, those very goods are the dangerous instruments of perdition and
      scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all it is merely a humble proposition that I submit to you.
      Were it in my power to take an active part in the matter, I should do
      nothing of myself. My will is not my own. It belongs, with all I possess,
      to those whom I have sworn absolute obedience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a slight noise interrupted M. Joshua, and drew his attention from his
      work. He rose abruptly, and went straight to the window. Three gentle taps
      were given on the outside of one of the slats of the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Mahal?&rdquo; asked M. Joshua, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; was answered from without, also in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Malay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has succeeded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried M. Joshua, with an expression of great
      satisfaction; &ldquo;are you sure of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure: there is no devil more clever and intrepid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Djalma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parts of the letter, which I quoted, convinced him that I came
      from General Simon, and that he would find him at the ruins of Tchandi.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, at this moment&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma goes to the ruins, where he will encounter the black, the
      half blood, and the Indian. It is there they have appointed to meet the
      Malay, who tattooed the prince during his sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to examine the subterraneous passage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went there yesterday. One of the stones of the pedestal of the
      statue turns upon itself; the stairs are large; it will do.&rdquo;

      Malay came to tell me all, before he went to join them at the ruins of
      Tchandi&mdash;for he had remained hidden amongst the bushes, not daring to
      go there in the daytime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahal&mdash;if you have told the truth, and if all succeed&mdash;your
      pardon and ample reward are assured to you. Your berth has been taken on
      board the &lsquo;Ruyter;&rsquo; you will sail to-morrow; you will thus be
      safe from the malice of the Stranglers, who would follow you hither to
      revenge the death of their chiefs, Providence having chosen you to deliver
      those three great criminals to justice. Heaven will bless you!&mdash;Go
      and wait for me at the door of the governor&rsquo;s house; I will
      introduce you. The matter is so important that I do not hesitate to
      disturb him thus late in the night. Go quickly!&mdash;I will follow on my
      side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps of Mahal were distinctly audible, as he withdrew precipitately,
      and then silence reigned once more in the house. Joshua returned to his
      desk, and hastily added these words to the despatch, which he had before
      commenced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever may now happen, it will be impossible for Djalma to leave
      Batavia at present. You may rest quite satisfied; he will not be at Paris
      by the 13th of next February. As I foresaw, I shall have to be up all
      night.&mdash;I am just going to the governor&rsquo;s. To-morrow I will add
      a few lines to this long statement, which the steamship &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo;
      will convey to Europe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having locked up his papers, Joshua rang the bell loudly, and, to the
      great astonishment of his servants, not accustomed to see him leave home
      in the middle of the night, went in all haste to the residence of the
      governor of the island.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE RUINS OF TCHANDI. To the storm in the middle of the
    </h2>
    <p>
      day, the approach of which so well served the Strangler&rsquo;s designs
      upon Djalma, has succeeded a calm and serene night. The disk of the moon
      rises slowly behind a mass of lofty ruins, situated on a hill, in the
      midst of a thick wood, about three leagues from Batavia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ranges of stone, high walls of brick, fretted away by time, porticoes
      covered with parasitical vegetation, stand out boldly from the sheet of
      silver light which blends the horizon with the limpid blue of the heavens.
      Some rays of the moon, gliding through the opening on one of these
      porticoes, fall upon two colossal statues at the foot of an immense
      staircase, the loose stones of which are almost entirely concealed by
      grass, moss, and brambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fragments of one of these statues, broken in the middle, lie strewed
      upon the ground; the other, which remains whole and standing, is frightful
      to behold. It represents a man of gigantic proportions, with a head three
      feet high; the expression of the countenance is ferocious, eyes of
      brilliant slaty black are set beneath gray brows, the large, deep mouth
      gapes immoderately, and reptiles have made their nest between the lips of
      stone; by the light of the moon, a hideous swarm is there dimly visible. A
      broad girdle, adorned with symbolic ornaments, encircles the body of this
      statue, and fastens a long sword to its right side. The giant has four
      extended arms, and, in his great hands, he bears an elephant&rsquo;s head,
      a twisted serpent, a human skull, and a bird resembling a heron. The moon,
      shedding her light on the profile of this statue, serves to augment the
      weirdness of its aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, enclosed in the half-crumbling walls of brick, are
      fragments of stone bas-reliefs, very boldly cut; one of those in the best
      preservation represents a man with the head of an elephant, and the wings
      of a bat, devouring a child. Nothing can be more gloomy than these ruins,
      buried among thick trees of a dark green, covered with frightful emblems,
      and seen by the moonlight, in the midst of the deep silence of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against one of the walls of this ancient temple, dedicated to some
      mysterious and bloody Javanese divinity, leans a kind of hut, rudely
      constructed of fragments of brick and stone; the door, made of woven
      rushes, is open, and a red light streams from it, which throws its rays on
      the tall grass that covers the ground. Three men are assembled in this
      hovel, around a clay-lamp, with a wick of cocoanut fibre steeped in
      palm-oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these three, about forty years of age, is poorly clad in the
      European fashion; his pale, almost white, complexion, announces that he
      belongs to the mixed race, being offspring of a white father and Indian
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second is a robust African negro, with thick lips, vigorous shoulders,
      and lank legs; his woolly hair is beginning to turn gray; he is covered
      with rags, and stands close beside the Indian. The third personage is
      asleep, and stretched on a mat in the corner of the hovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three men are the three Thuggee chiefs, who, obliged to fly from the
      continent of India, have taken refuge in Java, under the guidance of Mahal
      the Smuggler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Malay does not return,&rdquo; said the half-blood, named
      Faringhea, the most redoubtable chief of this homicidal sect: &ldquo;in
      executing our orders, he has perhaps been killed by Djalma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm of this morning brought every reptile out of the earth,&rdquo;
      said the negro; &ldquo;the Malay must have been bitten, and his body ere
      now a nest of serpents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To serve the good work,&rdquo; proceeded Faringhea, with a gloomy
      air, &ldquo;one must know how to brave death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to inflict it,&rdquo; added the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stifled cry, followed by some inarticulate words, here drew the
      attention of these two men, who hastily turned their heads in the
      direction of the sleeper. This latter was thirty years old at most. His
      beardless face, of a bright copper color, his robe of coarse stuff, his
      turban striped brown and yellow, showed that he belonged to the pure
      Hindoo race. His sleep appeared agitated by some painful vision; an
      abundant sweat streamed over his countenance, contracted by terror; he
      spoke in his dream, but his words were brief and broken, and accompanied
      with convulsive starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again that dream!&rdquo; said Faringhea to the negro. &ldquo;Always
      the remembrance of that man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not remember, how, five years ago, that savage, Colonel
      Kennedy, butcher of the Indians, came to the banks of the Ganges, to hunt
      the tiger, with twenty horses, four elephants, and fifty servants?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the negro; &ldquo;and we three, hunters of
      men, made a better day&rsquo;s sport than he did. Kennedy, his horses, his
      elephants, and his numerous servants did not get their tiger&mdash;but we
      got ours,&rdquo; he added, with grim irony. &ldquo;Yes; Kennedy, that
      tiger with a human face, fell into our ambush, and the brothers of the
      good work offered up their fine prey to our goddess Bowanee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you remember, it was just at the moment when we gave the last
      tug to the cord round Kennedy&rsquo;s neck, that we perceived on a sudden
      a traveller close at hand. He had seen us, and it was necessary to make
      away with him. Now, since that time,&rdquo; added Faringhea, &ldquo;the
      remembrance of the murder of that man pursues our brother in his dreams,&rdquo;
      and he pointed to the sleeping Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even when he is awake,&rdquo; said the negro, looking at
      Faringhea with a significant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the other, again pointing to the Indian, who,
      in the agitation of his dream, recommenced talking in abrupt sentences;
      &ldquo;listen! he is repeating the answers of the traveller, when we told
      him he must die, or serve with us on Thuggee. His mind is still impressed&mdash;deeply
      impressed&mdash;with those words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, the Indian repeated aloud in his sleep, a sort of mysterious
      dialogue, of which he himself supplied both questions and answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Traveller,&rsquo; said he, in a voice broken by sudden
      pauses, &lsquo;why that black mark on your forehead, stretching from one
      temple to the other? It is a mark of doom and your look is sad as death.
      Have you been a victim? Come with us; Kallee will avenge you. You have
      suffered?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, I have greatly suffered.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;For
      a long time?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, for a very long time.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You
      suffer even now?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, even now.&rsquo;&mdash;What do
      you reserve for those who injure you?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;My pity.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Will
      you not render blow for blow?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I will return love for
      hate.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Who are you, then, that render good for evil?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
      am one who loves, and suffers, and forgives.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, do you hear?&rdquo; said the negro to Faringhea; &ldquo;he
      has not forgotten the words of the traveller before his death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vision follows him. Listen! he will speak again. How pale he
      is!&rdquo; Still under the influence of his dream, the Indian continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Traveller, we are three; we are brave; we have your life in
      our hands&mdash;you have seen us sacrifice to the good work. Be one of us,
      or die&mdash;die&mdash;die! Oh, that look! Not thus&mdash;do not look at
      me thus!&rsquo;&rdquo; As he uttered these last words, the Indian made a
      sudden movement, as if to keep off some approaching object, and awoke with
      a start. Then, passing his hand over his moist forehead, he looked round
      him with a bewildered eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! again this dream, brother?&rdquo; said Faringhea. &ldquo;For
      a bold hunter of men, you have a weak head. Luckily, you have a strong
      heart and arm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other remained a moment silent, his face buried in his hands; then he
      replied: &ldquo;It is long since I last dreamed of that traveller.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not dead?&rdquo; said Faringhea, shrugging his shoulders.
      &ldquo;Did you not yourself throw the cord around his neck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Indian shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we not dig his grave by the side of Colonel Kennedy&rsquo;s?
      Did we not bury him with the English butcher, under the sand and the
      rushes?&rdquo; said the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we dug his grave,&rdquo; said the Indian, trembling; &ldquo;and
      yet, only a year ago, I was seated one evening at the gate of Bombay,
      waiting for one of our brothers&mdash;the sun was setting behind the
      pagoda, to the right of the little hill&mdash;the scene is all before me
      now&mdash;I was seated under a figtree&mdash;when I heard a slow, firm,
      even step, and, as I turned round my head&mdash;I saw him&mdash;coming out
      of the town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vision,&rdquo; said the negro; &ldquo;always the same vision!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vision,&rdquo; added Faringhea, &ldquo;or a vague resemblance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him by the black mark on his forehead; it was none but he. I
      remained motionless with fear, gazing at him with eyes aghast. He stopped,
      bending upon me his calm, sad look. In spite of myself, I could not help
      exclaiming: &lsquo;It is he!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied,
      in his gentle voice, &lsquo;it is I. Since all whom thou killest must
      needs live again,&rsquo; and he pointed to heaven as he spoke, &lsquo;why
      shouldst thou kill?&mdash;Hear me! I have just come from Java; I am going
      to the other end of the world, to a country of never-melting snow; but,
      here or there, on plains of fire or plains of ice, I shall still be the
      same. Even so is it with the souls of those who fall beneath thy
      kalleepra; in this world or up above, in this garb or in another, the soul
      must still be a soul; thou canst not smite it. Why then kill?&rsquo;&mdash;and
      shaking his head sorrowfully, he went on his way, walking slowly, with
      downcast eyes; he ascended the hill of the pagoda; I watched him as he
      went, without being able to move: at the moment the sun set, he was
      standing on the summit of the hill, his tall figure thrown out against the
      sky&mdash;and so he disappeared. Oh! it was he!&rdquo; added the Indian
      with a shudder, after a long pause: &ldquo;it was none but he.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this story the Indian had never varied, though he had often entertained
      his companions with the same mysterious adventure. This persistency on his
      part had the effect of shaking their incredulity, or at least of inducing
      them to seek some natural cause for this apparently superhuman event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Faringhea, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
      &ldquo;the knot round the traveller&rsquo;s neck got jammed, and some
      breath was left him, the air may have penetrated the rushes with which we
      covered his grave, and so life have returned to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Indian, shaking his head, &ldquo;this man
      is not of our race.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I know it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the Indian, in a solemn voice; &ldquo;the
      number of victims that the children of Bowanee have sacrificed since the
      commencement of ages, is nothing compared to the immense heap of dead and
      dying, whom this terrible traveller leaves behind him in his murderous
      march.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He?&rdquo; cried the negro and Faringhea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he!&rdquo; repeated the Hindoo, with a convinced accent, that
      made its impression upon his companions. &ldquo;Hear me and tremble!&mdash;When
      I met this traveller at the gates of Bombay, he came from Java, and was
      going towards the north, he said. The very next day, the town was a prey
      to the cholera, and we learned sometime after, that this plague had first
      broken out here, in Java.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me still further!&rdquo; resumed the other. &ldquo;&lsquo;I am
      going towards the north, to a country of eternal snow,&rsquo; said the
      traveller to me. The cholera also went towards the north, passing through
      Muscat&mdash;Ispahan&mdash;Tauris&mdash;Tiflis&mdash;till it overwhelmed
      Siberia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Faringhea, becoming thoughtful:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the cholera,&rdquo; resumed the Indian, &ldquo;only travelled
      its five or six leagues a day&mdash;a man&rsquo;s tramp&mdash;never
      appeared in two places at once&mdash;but swept on slowly, steadily,&mdash;even
      as a man proceeds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of this strange coincidence, the Hindoo&rsquo;s companions
      looked at each other in amazement. After a silence of some minutes, the
      awe-struck negro said to the last speaker: &ldquo;So you think that this
      man&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that this man, whom we killed, restored to life by some
      infernal divinity, has been commissioned to bear this terrible scourge
      over the earth, and to scatter round his steps that death, from which he
      is himself secure. Remember!&rdquo; added the Indian, with gloomy
      enthusiasm, &ldquo;this awful wayfarer passed through Java&mdash;the
      cholera wasted Java. He passed through Bombay&mdash;the cholera wasted
      Bombay. He went towards the north&mdash;the cholera wasted the north.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the Indian fell into a profound reverie. The negro and
      Faringhea were seized with gloomy astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian spoke the truth as to the mysterious march (still unexplained)
      of that fearful malady, which has never been known to travel more than
      five or six leagues a day, or to appear simultaneously in two spots.
      Nothing can be more curious, than to trace out, on the maps prepared at
      the period in question, the slow, progressive course of this travelling
      pestilence, which offers to the astonished eye all the capricious
      incidents of a tourist&rsquo;s journey. Passing this way rather than that&mdash;selecting
      provinces in a country&mdash;towns in a province&mdash;one quarter in a
      town&mdash;one street in a quarter&mdash;one house in a street&mdash;having
      its place of residence and repose, and then continuing its slow,
      mysterious, fear inspiring march.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of the Hindoo, by drawing attention to these dreadful
      eccentricities, made a strong impression upon the minds of the negro and
      Faringhea&mdash;wild natures, brought by horrible doctrines to the
      monomania of murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;for this also is an established fact&mdash;there have been in
      India members of an abominable community, who killed without motive,
      without passion&mdash;killed for the sake of killing&mdash;for the
      pleasure of murder&mdash;to substitute death for life&mdash;to make of a
      living man a corpse, as they have themselves declared in one of their
      examinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind loses itself in the attempt to penetrate the causes of these
      monstrous phenomena. By what incredible series of events, have men been
      induced to devote themselves to this priesthood of destruction? Without
      doubt, such a religion could only flourish in countries given up, like
      India, to the most atrocious slavery, and to the most merciless iniquity
      of man to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a creed!&mdash;is it not the hate of exasperated humanity, wound up
      to its highest pitch by oppression?&mdash;May not this homicidal sect,
      whose origin is lost in the night of ages, have been perpetuated in these
      regions, as the only possible protest of slavery against despotism? May
      not an inscrutable wisdom have here made Phansegars, even as are made
      tigers and serpents?
    </p>
    <p>
      What is most remarkable in this awful sect, is the mysterious bond, which,
      uniting its members amongst themselves, separates them from all other men.
      They have laws and customs of their own, they support and help each other,
      but for them there is neither country nor family; they owe no allegiance
      save to a dark, invisible power, whose decrees they obey with blind
      submission, and in whose name they spread themselves abroad, to make
      corpses, according to their own savage expression.(6)
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments the three Stranglers had maintained a profound silence.

    <p>
      Outside the hut, the moon continued to throw great masses of white
      radiance, and tall bluish shadows, over the imposing fabric of the ruins;
      the stars sparkled in the heavens; from time to time, a faint breeze
      rustled through the thick and varnished leaves of the bananas and the
      palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pedestal of the gigantic statue, which, still entire, stood on the
      left side of the portico, rested upon large flagstones, half hidden with
      brambles. Suddenly, one of these stones appeared to fall in; and from the
      aperture, which thus formed itself without noise, a man, dressed in
      uniform, half protruded his body, looked carefully around him, and
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the rays of the lamp, which lighted the interior of the hovel,
      tremble upon the tall grass, he turned round to make a signal, and soon,
      accompanied by two other soldiers, he ascended, with the greatest silence
      and precaution, the last steps of the subterranean staircase, and went
      gliding amongst the ruins. For a few moments, their moving shadows were
      thrown upon the moonlit ground; then they disappeared behind some
      fragments of broken wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the instant when the large stone resumed its place and level, the heads
      of many other soldiers might have been seen lying close in the excavation.
      The half-caste, the Indian, and the negro, still seated thoughtfully in
      the hut, did not perceive what was passing.

      (6) The following are some passages from the Count de Warren&rsquo;s very
      curious book, &ldquo;British India in 1831:&rdquo; &ldquo;Besides the
      robbers, who kill for the sake of the booty they hope to find upon
      travellers, there is a class of assassins, forming an organized society,
      with chiefs of their own, a slang-language, a science, a free-masonry, and
      even a religion, which has its fanaticism and its devotion, its agents,
      emissaries, allies, its militant forces, and its passive adherents, who
      contribute their money to the good work. This is the community of the
      Thugs or Phansegars (deceivers or stranglers, from thugna, to deceive, and
      phansna, to strangle), a religious and economical society, which
      speculates with the human race by exterminating men; its origin is lost in
      the night of ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until 1810 their existence was unknown, not only to the European
      conquerors, but even to the native governments. Between the years 1816 and
      1830, several of their bands were taken in the act, and punished: but
      until this last epoch, all the revelations made on the subject by officers
      of great experience, had appeared too monstrous to obtain the attention or
      belief of the public; they had been rejected and despised as the dreams of
      a heated imagination. And yet for many years, at the very least for half a
      century, this social wound had been frightfully on the increase, devouring
      the population from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin and from Cutch to Assam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the year 1830 that the revelations of a celebrated chief,
      whose life was spared on condition of his denouncing his accomplices, laid
      bare the whole system. The basis of the Thuggee Society is a religious
      belief&mdash;the worship of Bowanee, a gloomy divinity, who is only
      pleased with carnage, and detests above all things the human race. Her
      most agreeable sacrifices are human victims, and the more of these her
      disciple may have offered up in this world the more he will be recompensed
      in the next by all the delights of soul and sense, by women always
      beautiful, and joys eternally renewed. If the assassin meets the scaffold
      in his career, he dies with the enthusiasm of a martyr, because he expects
      his reward. To obey his divine mistress, he murders, without anger and
      without remorse, the old man, woman and child; whilst, to his
      fellow-religionists, he may be charitable, humane, generous, devoted, and
      may share all in common with them, because, like himself, they are the
      ministers and adopted children of Bowanee. The destruction of his
      fellow-creatures, not belonging to his community&mdash;the diminution of
      the human race&mdash;that is the primary object of his pursuit; it is not
      as a means of gain, for though plunder may be a frequent, and doubtless an
      agreeable accessory, it is only secondary in his estimation. Destruction
      is his end, his celestial mission, his calling; it is also a delicious
      passion, the most captivating of all sports&mdash;this hunting of men!&mdash;&lsquo;You
      find great pleasure,&rsquo; said one of those that were condemned, &lsquo;in
      tracking the wild beast to his den, in attacking the boar, the tiger,
      because there is danger to brave, energy and courage to display. Think how
      this attraction must be redoubled, when the contest is with man, when it
      is man that is to be destroyed. Instead of the single faculty of courage,
      all must be called into action&mdash;courage, cunning, foresight,
      eloquence, intrigue. What springs to put in motion! what plans to develop!
      To sport with all the passions, to touch the chords of love and
      friendship, and so draw the prey into one&rsquo;s net&mdash;that is a
      glorious chase&mdash;it is a delight, a rapture, I tell you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever was in India in the years 1831 and 1832, must remember the
      stupor and affright, which the discovery of this vast infernal machine
      spread through all classes of society. A great number of magistrates and
      administrators of provinces refused to believe in it, and could not be
      brought to comprehend that such a system had so long preyed on the body
      politic, under their eyes as it were, silently, and without betraying
      itself.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;British India in 183,&rdquo; by Count
      Edward de Warren, 2 vols. in 8vo. Paris, 1844.&mdash;E. S.

      CHAPTER XXII. THE AMBUSCADE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he half-blood
      Faringhea, wishing doubtless to escape from the dark thoughts which the
      words of the Indian on the mysterious course of the Cholera had raised
      within him, abruptly changed the subject of conversation. His eye shone
      with lurid fire, and his countenance took an expression of savage
      enthusiasm, as he cried: &ldquo;Bowanee will always watch over us,
      intrepid hunters of men! Courage, brothers, courage! The world is large;
      our prey is everywhere. The English may force us to quit India, three
      chiefs of the good work&mdash;but what matter? We leave there our
      brethren, secret, numerous, and terrible, as black scorpions, whose
      presence is only known by their mortal sting. Exiles will widen our
      domains. Brother, you shall have America!&rdquo; said he to the Hindoo,
      with an inspired air. &ldquo;Brother, you shall have Africa!&rdquo; said
      he to the negro. &ldquo;Brothers, I will take Europe! Wherever men are to
      be found, there must be oppressors and victims&mdash;wherever there are
      victims, there must be hearts swollen with hate&mdash;it is for us to
      inflame that hate with all the ardor of vengeance! It is for us, servants
      of Bowanee, to draw towards us, by seducing wiles, all whose zeal,
      courage, and audacity may be useful to the cause. Let us rival each other
      in devotion and sacrifices; let us lend each other strength, help,
      support! That all who are not with us may be our prey, let us stand alone
      in the midst of all, against all, and in spite of all. For us, there must
      be neither country nor family. Our family is composed of our brethren; our
      country is the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of savage eloquence made a deep impression on the negro and the
      Indian, over whom Faringhea generally exercised considerable influence,
      his intellectual powers being very superior to theirs, though they were
      themselves two of the most eminent chiefs of this bloody association.
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right, brother!&rdquo; cried the Indian, sharing the
      enthusiasm of Faringhea; &ldquo;the world is ours. Even here, in Java, let
      us leave some trace of our passage. Before we depart, let us establish the
      good work in this island; it will increase quickly, for here also is great
      misery, and the Dutch are rapacious as the English. Brother, I have seen
      in the marshy rice-fields of this island, always fatal to those who
      cultivate them, men whom absolute want forced to the deadly task&mdash;they
      were livid as corpses&mdash;some of them worn out with sickness, fatigue,
      and hunger, fell&mdash;never to rise again. Brothers, the good work will
      prosper in this country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other evening,&rdquo; said the half-caste, &ldquo;I was on the
      banks of the lake, behind a rock; a young woman came there&mdash;a few
      rags hardly covered her lean and sun-scorched body&mdash;in her arms she
      held a little child, which she pressed weeping to her milkless breast. She
      kissed it three times, and said to it: &lsquo;You, at least, shall not be
      so unhappy as your father&rsquo;&mdash;and she threw it into the lake. It
      uttered one wail, and disappeared. On this cry, the alligators, hidden
      amongst the reeds, leaped joyfully into the water. There are mothers here
      who kill their children out of pity.&mdash;Brothers, the good work will
      prosper in this country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; said the negro, &ldquo;whilst they tore the
      flesh of one of his black slaves with whips, a withered old merchant of
      Batavia left his country-house to come to the town. Lolling in his
      palanquin, he received, with languid indolence, the sad caresses of two of
      those girls, whom he had bought, to people his harem, from parents too
      poor to give them food. The palanquin, which held this little old man, and
      the girls, was carried by twelve young and robust men. There are here, you
      see, mothers who in their misery sell their own daughters&mdash;slaves
      that are scourged&mdash;men that carry other men, like beasts of burden.&mdash;Brothers,
      the good work will prosper in this country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in this country&mdash;and in every land of oppression,
      distress, corruption, and slavery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could we but induce Djalma to join us, as Mahal the Smuggler
      advised,&rdquo; said the Indian, &ldquo;our voyage to Java would doubly
      profit us; for we should then number among our band this brave and
      enterprising youth, who has so many motives to hate mankind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will soon be here; let us envenom his resentments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remind him of his father&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the massacre of his people!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His own captivity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let hatred inflame his heart, and he will be ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro, who had remained for some time lost in thought, said suddenly:
      &ldquo;Brothers, suppose Mahal the Smuggler were to betray us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rdquo; cried the Hindoo, almost with indignation; &ldquo;he gave
      us an asylum on board his bark; he secured our flight from the Continent;
      he is again to take us with him to Bombay, where we shall find vessels for
      America, Europe, Africa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What interest would Mahal have to betray us?&rdquo; said Faringhea.
      &ldquo;Nothing could save him from the vengeance of the sons of Bowanee,
      and that he knows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the black, &ldquo;he promised to get Djalma to
      come hither this evening, and, once amongst us, he must needs be our own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not the Smuggler who told us to order the Malay to enter the
      ajoupa of Djalma, to surprise him during his sleep, and, instead of
      killing him as he might have done, to trace the name of Bowanee upon his
      arm? Djalma will thus learn to judge of the resolution, the cunning and
      obedience of our brethren, and he will understand what he has to hope or
      fear from such men. Be it through admiration or through terror, he must
      become one of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he refuses to join us, notwithstanding the reasons he has to
      hate mankind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;Bowanee will decide his fate,&rdquo; said Faringhea,
      with a gloomy look; &ldquo;I have my plan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will the Malay succeed in surprising Djalma during his sleep?&rdquo;
      said the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none nobler, more agile, more dexterous, than the Malay,&rdquo;
      said Faringhea. &ldquo;He once had the daring to surprise in her den a
      black panther, as she suckled her cub. He killed the dam, and took away
      the young one, which he afterwards sold to some European ship&rsquo;s
      captain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Malay has succeeded!&rdquo; exclaimed the Indian, listening to
      a singular kind of hoot, which sounded through the profound silence of the
      night and of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is the scream of the vulture seizing its prey,&rdquo; said
      the negro, listening in his turn; &ldquo;it is also the signal of our
      brethren, after they have seized their prey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, the Malay appeared at the door of the hut. He had wound
      around him a broad length of cotton, adorned with bright colored stripes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the negro, anxiously; &ldquo;have you succeeded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma must bear all his life the mark of the good work,&rdquo;
      said the Malay, proudly. &ldquo;To reach him, I was forced to offer up to
      Bowanee a man who crossed my path&mdash;I have left his body under the
      brambles, near the ajoupa. But Djalma is marked with the sign. Mahal the
      Smuggler was the first to know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Djalma did not awake?&rdquo; said the Indian, confounded by the
      Malay&rsquo;s adroitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he awoke,&rdquo; replied the other, calmly, &ldquo;I should
      have been a dead man&mdash;as I was charged to spare his life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because his life may be more useful to us than his death,&rdquo;
      said the half-caste. Then, addressing the Malay, he added: &ldquo;Brother,
      in risking life for the good work, you have done to-day what we did
      yesterday, what we may do again to-morrow. This time, you obey; another
      you will command.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all belong to Bowanee,&rdquo; answered the Malay. &ldquo;What is
      there yet to do?&mdash;I am ready.&rdquo; Whilst he thus spoke, his face
      was turned towards the door of the hut; on a sudden, he said in a low
      voice: &ldquo;Here is Djalma. He approaches the cabin. Mahal has not
      deceived us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must not see me yet,&rdquo; said Faringhea, retiring to an
      obscure corner of the cabin, and hiding himself under a mat; &ldquo;try to
      persuade him. If he resists&mdash;I have my project.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Faringhea disappeared, saying these words, when Djalma arrived
      at the door of the hovel. At sight of those three personages with their
      forbidding aspect, Djalma started in surprise. But ignorant that these men
      belonged to the Phansegars, and knowing that, in a country where there are
      no inns, travellers often pass the night under a tent, or beneath the
      shelter of some ruins, he continued to advance towards them. After the
      first moment, he perceived by the complexion and the dress of one of these
      men, that he was an Indian, and he accosted him in the Hindoo language:
      &ldquo;I thought to have found here a European&mdash;a Frenchman&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Frenchman is not yet come,&rdquo; replied the Indian; &ldquo;but
      he will not be long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guessing by Djalma&rsquo;s question the means which Mahal had employed to
      draw him into the snare, the Indian hoped to gain time by prolonging his
      error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew this Frenchman?&rdquo; asked Djalma of the Phansegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appointed us to meet here, as he did you,&rdquo; answered the
      Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; inquired Djalma, more and more astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know when he arrives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Simon told you to be at this place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General Simon,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, during which Djalma sought in vain to
      explain to himself this mysterious adventure. &ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;
      asked he, with a look of suspicion; for the gloomy silence of the
      Phansegar&rsquo;s two companions, who stared fixedly at each other, began
      to give him some uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are yours, if you will be ours,&rdquo; answered the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no need of you&mdash;nor you of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are deceived. The English killed your father, a king; made you
      a captive; proscribed you, you have lost all your possessions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this cruel reminder, the countenance of Djalma darkened. He started,
      and a bitter smile curled his lip. The Phansegar continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was just and brave&mdash;beloved by his subjects&mdash;they
      called him &lsquo;Father of the Generous,&rsquo; and he was well named.
      Will you leave his death unavenged? Will the hate, which gnaws at your
      heart, be without fruit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father died with arms in his hand. I revenged his death on the
      English whom I killed in war. He, who has since been a father to me, and
      who fought also in the same cause, told me, that it would now be madness
      to attempt to recover my territory from the English. When they gave me my
      liberty, I swore never again to set foot in India&mdash;and I keep the
      oaths I make.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who despoiled you, who took you captive, who killed your
      father&mdash;were men. Are there not other men, on whom you can avenge
      yourself! Let your hate fall upon them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, who speak thus of men, are not a man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, and those who resemble me, are more than men. We are, to the
      rest of the human race, what the bold hunter is to the wild beasts, which
      they run down in the forest. Will you be, like us, more than a man? Will
      you glut surely, largely, safely&mdash;the hate which devours your heart,
      for all the evil done you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words become more and more obscure: I have no hatred in my
      heart,&rdquo; said Djalma. &ldquo;When an enemy is worthy of me, I fight
      with him; when he is unworthy, I despise him. So that I have no hate&mdash;either
      for brave men or cowards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; cried the negro on a sudden, pointing with rapid
      gesture to the door, for Djalma and the Indian had now withdrawn a little
      from it, and were standing in one corner of the hovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the shout of the negro, Faringhea, who had not been perceived by
      Djalma, threw off abruptly the mat which covered him, drew his crease,
      started up like a tiger, and with one bound was out of the cabin. Then,
      seeing a body of soldiers advancing cautiously in a circle, he dealt one
      of them a mortal stroke, threw down two others, and disappeared in the
      midst of the ruins. All this passed so instantaneously, that, when Djalma
      turned round, to ascertain the cause of the negro&rsquo;s cry of alarm,
      Faringhea had already disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The muskets of several soldiers, crowding to the door, were immediately
      pointed at Djalma and the three Stranglers, whilst others went in pursuit
      of Faringhea. The negro, the Malay, and the Indian, seeing the
      impossibility of resistance, exchanged a few rapid words, and offered
      their hands to the cords, with which some of the soldiers had provided
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch captain, who commanded the squad, entered the cabin at this
      moment. &ldquo;And this other one?&rdquo; said he, pointing out Djalma to
      the soldiers, who were occupied in binding the three Phansegars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each in his turn, captain!&rdquo; said an old sergeant. &ldquo;We
      come to him next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma had remained petrified with surprise, not understanding what was
      passing round him; but, when he saw the sergeant and two soldiers approach
      with ropes to bind him, he repulsed them with violent indignation, and
      rushed towards the door where stood the officer. The soldiers, who had
      supposed that Djalma would submit to his fate with the same impassibility
      as his companions, were astounded by this resistance, and recoiled some
      paces, being struck in spite of themselves, with the noble and dignified
      air of the son of Kadja-sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would you bind me like these men?&rdquo; cried Djalma,
      addressing himself in Hindostanee to the officer, who understood that
      language from his long service in the Dutch colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would we bind you, wretch?&mdash;because you form part of this
      band of assassins. What?&rdquo; added the officer in Dutch, speaking to
      the soldiers, &ldquo;are you afraid of him?&mdash;Tie the cord tight about
      his wrists; there will soon be another about his neck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Djalma, with a dignity and calmness
      which astonished the officer; &ldquo;I have hardly been in this place a
      quarter of an hour&mdash;I do not know these men. I came here to meet a
      Frenchman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a Phansegar like them?&mdash;Who will believe the falsehood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them!&rdquo; cried Djalma, with so natural a movement and
      expression of horror, that with a sign the officer stopped the soldiers,
      who were again advancing to bind the son of Kadja-sing; &ldquo;these men
      form part of that horrible band of murderers! and you accuse me of being
      their accomplice!&mdash;Oh, in this case, sir! I am perfectly at ease,&rdquo;
      said the young man, with a smile of disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be sufficient to say that you are tranquil,&rdquo;
      replied the officer; &ldquo;thanks to their confessions, we now know by
      what mysterious signs to recognize the Thugs.&rdquo;
    </p>

      &ldquo;I repeat, sir, that I hold these murderers in the greatest horror,
      and that I came here&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro, interrupting Djalma, said to the officer with a ferocious joy:
      &ldquo;You have hit it; the sons of the good work do know each other by
      marks tattooed on their skin. For us, the hour has come&mdash;we give our
      necks to the cord. Often enough have we twined it round the necks of those
      who served not with us the good work. Now, look at our arms, and look at
      the arms of this youth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer, misinterpreting the words of the negro, said to Djalma:
      &ldquo;It is quite clear, that if, as this negro tells us, you do not bear
      on your arm the mysterious symbol&mdash;(we are going to assure ourselves
      of the fact), and if you can explain your presence here in a satisfactory
      manner, you may be at liberty within two hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand me,&rdquo; said the negro to the officer;
      &ldquo;Prince Djalma is one of us, for he bears on his left arm the name
      of Bowanee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! he is like us, a son of Kale!&rdquo; added the Malay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is like us, a Phansegar,&rdquo; said the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men, irritated at the horror which Djalma had manifested on
      learning that they were Phansegars, took a savage pride in making it
      believed that the son of Kadja-sing belonged to their frightful
      association.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to answer?&rdquo; said the officer to Djalma. The
      latter again gave a look of disdainful pity, raised with his right hand
      his long, wide left sleeve, and displayed his naked arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What audacity!&rdquo; cried the officer, for on the inner part of
      the fore arm, a little below the bend, the name of the Bowanee, in bright
      red Hindoo characters, was distinctly visible. The officer ran to the
      Malay, and uncovered his arm; he saw the same word, the same signs. Not
      yet satisfied, he assured himself that the negro and the Indian were
      likewise so marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried he, turning furiously towards Djalma; &ldquo;you
      inspire even more horror than your accomplices. Bind him like a cowardly
      assassin,&rdquo; added he to the soldiers; &ldquo;like a cowardly
      assassin, who lies upon the brink of the grave, for his execution will not
      be long delayed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck with stupor, Djalma, who for some moments had kept his eye riveted
      on the fatal mark, was unable to pronounce a word, or make the least
      movement: his powers of thought seemed to fail him, in presence of this
      incomprehensible fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you dare deny this sign?&rdquo; said the officer to him, with
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot deny what I see&mdash;what is,&rdquo; said Djalma, quite
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lucky that you confess at last,&rdquo; replied the officer.
      &ldquo;Soldiers, keep watch over him and his accomplices&mdash;you answer
      for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost believing himself the sport of some wild dream. Djalma offered no
      resistance, but allowed himself to be bound and removed with mechanical
      passiveness. The officer, with part of his soldiers, hoped still to
      discover Faringhea amongst the ruins; but his search was vain, and, after
      spending an hour in fruitless endeavors, he set out for Batavia, where the
      escort of the prisoners had arrived before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours after these events, M. Joshua van Dael thus finished his long
      despatch, addressed to M. Rodin, of Paris:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances were such, that I could not act otherwise; and,
      taking all into consideration, it is a very small evil for a great good.
      Three murderers are delivered over to justice, and the temporary arrest of
      Djalma will only serve to make his innocence shine forth with redoubled
      luster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already this morning I went to the governor, to protest in favor of
      our young prince. &lsquo;As it was through me,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that
      those three great criminals fell into the hands of the authorities, let
      them at least show me some gratitude, by doing everything to render clear
      as day the innocence of Prince Djalma, so interesting by reason of his
      misfortunes and noble qualities. Most certainly,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;when
      I came yesterday to inform the governor, that the Phansegars would be
      found assembled in the ruins of Tchandi, I was far from anticipating that
      any one would confound with those wretches the adopted son of General
      Simon, an excellent man, with whom I have had for some time the most
      honorable relations. We must, then, at any cost, discover the
      inconceivable mystery that has placed Djalma in this dangerous position;&rsquo;
      and, I continued, &lsquo;so convinced am I of his innocence, that, for his
      own sake, I would not ask for any favor on his behalf. He will have
      sufficient courage and dignity to wait patiently in prison for the day of
      justice.&rsquo; In all this, you see, I spoke nothing but the truth, and
      had not to reproach myself with the least deception, for nobody in the
      world is more convinced than I am of Djalma&rsquo;s innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The governor answered me as I expected, that morally he felt as
      certain as I did of the innocence of the young prince, and would treat him
      with all possible consideration; but that it was necessary for justice to
      have its course, because it would be the only way of demonstrating the
      falsehood of the accusation, and discovering by what unaccountable
      fatality that mysterious sign was tattooed upon Djalma&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahal the Smuggler, who alone could enlighten justice on this
      subject, will in another hour have quitted Batavia, to go on board the
      &lsquo;Ruyter,&rsquo; which will take him to Egypt; for he has a note from
      me to the captain, to certify that he is the person for whom I engaged and
      paid the passage. At the same time, he will be the bearer of this long
      despatch, for the &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo; is to sail in an hour, and the last
      letter-bag for Europe was made up yesterday evening. But I wished to see
      the governor this morning, before closing the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, then, is Prince Djalma enforced detained for a month, and,
      this opportunity of the &lsquo;Ruyter&rsquo; once lost, it is materially
      impossible that the young Indian can be in France by the 13th of next
      February. You see, therefore, that, even as you ordered, so have I acted
      according to the means at my disposal&mdash;considering only the end which
      justifies them&mdash;for you tell me a great interest of the society is
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your hands, I have been what we all ought to be in the hands of
      our superiors&mdash;a mere instrument: since, for the greater glory of
      God, we become corpses with regard to the will.(7) Men may deny our unity
      and power, and the times appear opposed to us; but circumstances only
      change; we are ever the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obedience and courage, secrecy and patience, craft and audacity,
      union and devotion&mdash;these become us, who have the world for our
      country, our brethren for family, Rome for our Queen!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;J. V.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Mahal the Smuggler set out with
      this despatch (sealed) in his possession, to board the &ldquo;Ruyter.&rdquo;
      An hour later, the dead body of this same Mahal, strangled by Thuggee, lay
      concealed beneath some reeds on the edge of a desert strand, whither he
      had gone to take boat to join the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at a subsequent period, after the departure of the steamship, they
      found the corpse of the smuggler, M. Joshua sought in vain for the
      voluminous packet, which he had entrusted to his care. Neither was there
      any trace of the note which Mahal was to have delivered to the captain of
      the &ldquo;Ruyter,&rdquo; in order to be received as passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the searches and bushwhacking ordered throughout the country for
      the purpose of discovering Faringhea, were of no avail. The dangerous
      chief of the Stranglers was never seen again in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      (7) It is known that the doctrine of passive and absolute obedience, the
      main-spring of the Society of Jesus, is summed up in those terrible words
      of the dying Loyola: &ldquo;Every member of the Order shall be, in the
      hands of his superiors, even as a corpse (Perinde ac Cadaver).&rdquo;&mdash;E.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. M. RODIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hree months have
      elapsed since Djalma was thrown into Batavia Prison accused of belonging
      to the murderous gang of Megpunnas. The following scene takes place in
      France, at the commencement of the month of February, 1832, in Cardoville
      Manor House, an old feudal habitation standing upon the tall cliffs of
      Picardy, not far from Saint Valery, a dangerous coast on which almost
      every year many ships are totally wrecked, being driven on shore by the
      northwesters, which render the navigation of the Channel so perilous.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the interior of the Castle is heard the howling of a violent tempest,
      which has arisen during the night; a frequent formidable noise, like the
      discharge of artillery, thunders in the distance, and is repeated by the
      echoes of the shore; it is the sea breaking with fury against the high
      rocks which are overlooked by the ancient Manor House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Daylight is not yet
      visible through the windows of a large room situated on the ground-floor.
      In this apartment, in which a lamp is burning, a woman of about sixty
      years of age, with a simple and honest countenance, dressed as a rich
      farmer&rsquo;s wife of Picardy, is already occupied with her needle-work,
      notwithstanding the early hour. Close by, the husband of this woman, about
      the same age as herself, is seated at a large table, sorting and putting
      up in bags divers samples of wheat and oats. The face of this white-haired
      man is intelligent and open, announcing good sense and honesty, enlivened
      by a touch of rustic humor; he wears a shooting-jacket of green cloth, and
      long gaiters of tan-colored leather, which half conceal his black
      velveteen breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrible storm which rages without renders still more agreeable the
      picture of this peaceful interior. A rousing fire burns in a broad
      chimney-place faced with white marble, and throws its joyous light on the
      carefully polished floor; nothing can be more cheerful than the old
      fashioned chintz hangings and curtains with red Chinese figures upon a
      white ground, and the panels over the door painted with pastoral scenes in
      the style of Watteau. A clock of Sevres china, and rosewood furniture
      inlaid with green&mdash;quaint and portly furniture, twisted into all
      sorts of grotesque shapes&mdash;complete the decorations of this
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out-doors, the gale continued to howl furiously, and sometimes a gust of
      wind would rush down the chimney, or shake the fastenings of the windows.
      The man who was occupied in sorting the samples of grain was M. Dupont,
      bailiff of Cardoville manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;what dreadful weather, my
      dear! This M. Rodin, who is to come here this morning, as the Princess de
      Saint Dizier&rsquo;s steward announced to us, picked out a very bad day
      for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in truth, I have rarely heard such a hurricane. If M. Rodin
      has never seen the sea in its fury, he may feast his eyes to-day with the
      sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it be that brings this M. Rodin, my dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! I know nothing about it. The steward tells me in his letter
      to show M. Rodin the greatest attention, and to obey him as if he were my
      master. It will be for him to explain himself, and for me to execute his
      orders, since he comes on the part of the princess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By rights he should come from Mademoiselle Adrienne, as the land
      belongs to her since the death of the duke her father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the princess being aunt to the young lady, her steward
      manages Mademoiselle Adrienne&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;so whether one or the
      other, it amounts to the same thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be M. Rodin means to buy the estate. Though, to be sure, that
      stout lady who came from Paris last week on purpose to see the chateau
      appeared to have a great wish for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the bailiff began to laugh with a sly look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to laugh at, Dupont?&rdquo; asked his wife, a very
      good creature, but not famous for intelligence or penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh,&rdquo; answered Dupont, &ldquo;to think of the face and
      figure of that enormous woman: with such a look, who the devil would call
      themselves Madame de la Sainte-Colombe&mdash;Mrs. Holy Dove? A pretty
      saint, and a pretty dove, truly! She is round as a hogshead, with the
      voice of a town-crier; has gray moustachios like an old grenadier, and
      without her knowing it, I heard her say to her servant: &lsquo;Stir your
      stumps, my hearty!&rsquo;&mdash;and yet she calls herself Sainte-Colombe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hard on her you are, Dupont; a body don&rsquo;t choose one&rsquo;s
      name. And, if she has a beard, it is not the lady&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but it is her fault to call herself Sainte-Colombe. Do you
      imagine it her true name? Ah, my poor Catherine, you are yet very green in
      some things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you, my poor Dupont, are well read in slander! This lady
      seems very respectable. The first thing she asked for on arriving was the
      chapel of the Castle, of which she had heard speak. She even said that she
      would make some embellishments in it; and, when I told her we had no
      church in this little place, she appeared quite vexed not to have a curate
      in the village.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure! that&rsquo;s the first thought of your upstarts&mdash;to
      play the great lady of the parish, like your titled people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de la Sainte-Colombe need not play the great lady, because
      she is one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She! a great lady? Oh, lor&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;only see how she was dressed, in scarlet gown, and violet
      gloves like a bishop&rsquo;s; and, when she took off her bonnet, she had a
      diamond band round her head-dress of false, light hair, and diamond
      ear-drops as large as my thumb, and diamond rings on every finger! None of
      your tuppenny beauties would wear so many diamonds in the middle of the
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a pretty judge!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say there&rsquo;s more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She talked of nothing but dukes, and marquises, and counts, and
      very rich gentlemen, who visit at her house, and are her most intimate
      friends; and then, when she saw the summer house in the park, half-burnt
      by the Prussians, which our late master never rebuilt, she asked, &lsquo;What
      are those ruins there?&rsquo; and I answered: &lsquo;Madame, it was in the
      time of the Allies that the pavilion was burnt.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, my
      clear,&rsquo; cried she; &lsquo;our allies, good, dear allies! they and
      the Restoration began my fortune!&rsquo; So you see, Dupont, I said to
      myself directly: &lsquo;She was no doubt one of the noble women who fled
      abroad&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de la Sainte-Colombe!&rdquo; cried the bailiff, laughing
      heartily. &ldquo;Oh, my poor, poor wife!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is all very well; but because you have been three years at
      Paris, don&rsquo;t think yourself a conjurer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine, let&rsquo;s drop it: you will make me say some folly,
      and there are certain things which dear, good creatures like you need
      never know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell what you are driving at, only try to be less
      slanderous&mdash;for, after all, should Madame de la Sainte-Colombe buy
      the estate, will you be sorry to remain as her bailiff, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I&mdash;for we are getting old, my good Catherine; we have
      lived here twenty years, and we have been too honest to provide for our
      old days by pilfering&mdash;and truly, at our age, it would be hard to
      seek another place, which perhaps we should not find. What I regret is,
      that Mademoiselle Adrienne should not keep the land; it seems that she
      wished to sell it, against the will of the princess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Dupont! is it not very extraordinary that
      Mademoiselle Adrienne should have the disposal of her large fortune so
      early in life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! simple enough. Our young lady, having no father or mother,
      is mistress of her property, besides having a famous little will of her
      own. Dost remember, ten years ago, when the count brought her down here
      one summer?&mdash;what an imp of mischief! and then what eyes! eh?&mdash;how
      they sparkled, even then!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that Mademoiselle Adrienne had in her look&mdash;an
      expression&mdash;a very uncommon expression for her age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she has kept what her witching, luring face promised, she must
      be very pretty by this time, notwithstanding the peculiar color of her
      hair&mdash;for, between ourselves, if she had been a tradesman&rsquo;s
      daughter, instead of a young lady of high birth, they would have called it
      red.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There again! more slander.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! against Mademoiselle Adrienne? Heaven forbid&mdash;I always
      thought that she would be as good as pretty, and it is not speaking ill of
      her to say she has red hair. On the contrary, it always appears to me so
      fine, so bright, so sunny, and to suit so well her snowy complexion and
      black eyes, that in truth I would not have had it other than it was; and I
      am sure, that now this very color of her hair, which would be a blemish in
      any one else, must only add to the charm of Mademoiselle Adrienne&rsquo;s
      face. She must have such a sweet vixen look!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to be candid, she really was a vixen&mdash;always running about
      the park, aggravating her governess, climbing the trees&mdash;in fact,
      playing all manner of naughty tricks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant you, Mademoiselle Adrienne was a chip of the old block; but
      then what wit, what engaging ways, and above all, what a good heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that she certainly had. Once I remember she gave her
      shawl and her new merino frock to a poor little beggar girl, and came back
      to the house in her petticoat, and bare arms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, an excellent heart&mdash;but headstrong&mdash;terribly
      headstrong!&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the worthy dame, with a sort of embarrassment and
      confusion, which showed how much she was shocked by such enormities,
      &ldquo;they say, that Mademoiselle Adrienne never sets foot in a church,
      but lives in a kind of heathen temple in her aunt&rsquo;s garden, where
      she has masked women to dress her up like a goddess, and scratches them
      very often, because she gets tipsy&mdash;without mentioning, that every
      night she plays on a hunting horn of massive gold&mdash;all which causes
      the utmost grief and despair to her poor aunt the princess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the bailiff burst into a fit of laughter, which interrupted his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; said he, when this first access of hilarity was
      over, &ldquo;where did you get these fine stories about Mademoiselle
      Adrienne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Rene&rsquo;s wife, who went to Paris to look for a child to
      nurse; she called at Saint-Dizier House, to see Madame Grivois, her
      godmother.&mdash;Now Madame Grivois is first bedchamber woman to the
      princess&mdash;and she it was who told her all this&mdash;and surely she
      ought to know, being in the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a fine piece of goods that Grivois! once she was a regular bad
      &lsquo;un, but now she professes to be as over-nice as her mistress; like
      master like man, they say. The princess herself, who is now so stiff and
      starched, knew how to carry on a lively game in her time. Fifteen years
      ago, she was no such prude: do you remember that handsome colonel of
      hussars, who was in garrison at Abbeville? an exiled noble who had served
      in Russia, whom the Bourbons gave a regiment on the Restoration?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I remember him; but you are really too backbiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit&mdash;I only speak the truth. The colonel spent his whole
      time here, and every one said he was very warm with this same princess,
      who is now such a saint. Oh! those were the jolly times. Every evening,
      some new entertainment at the chateau. What a fellow that colonel was, to
      set things going; how well he could act a play!&mdash;I remember&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff was unable to proceed. A stout maid-servant, wearing the
      costume and cap of Picardy, entered in haste, and thus addressed her
      mistress: &ldquo;Madame, there is a person here that wants to speak to
      master; he has come in the postmaster&rsquo;s calash from Saint-Valery,
      and he says that he is M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin?&rdquo; said the bailiff rising. &ldquo;Show him in
      directly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment after, M. Rodin made his appearance. According to his custom, he
      was dressed even more than plainly. With an air of great humility, he
      saluted the bailiff and his wife, and at a sign from her husband, the
      latter withdrew. The cadaverous countenance of M. Rodin, his almost
      invisible lips, his little reptile eyes, half concealed by their flabby
      lids, and the sordid style of his dress, rendered his general aspect far
      from prepossessing; yet this man knew how, when it was necessary, to
      affect, with diabolical art, so much sincerity and good-nature&mdash;his
      words were so affectionate and subtly penetrating&mdash;that the
      disagreeable feeling of repugnance, which the first sight of him generally
      inspired, wore off little by little, and he almost always finished by
      involving his dupe or victim in the tortuous windings of an eloquence as
      pliant as it was honeyed and perfidious; for ugliness and evil have their
      fascination, as well as what is good and fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest bailiff looked at this man with surprise, when he thought of
      the pressing recommendation of the steward of the Princess de Saint
      Dizier; he had expected to see quite another sort of personage, and,
      hardly able to dissemble his astonishment, he said to him: &ldquo;Is it to
      M. Rodin that I have the honor to speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and here is another letter from the steward of the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, draw near the fire, whilst I just see what is in this
      letter. The weather is so bad,&rdquo; continued the bailiff, obligingly,
      &ldquo;may I not offer you some refreshment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the
      chamber; like a man of skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just
      and useful inductions from those little appearances, which, revealing a
      taste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character; on this
      occasion, however, his curiosity was at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said the bailiff, when he had finished
      reading; &ldquo;the steward renews his recommendation, and tells me to
      attend implicitly to your commands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble
      you long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be no trouble, but an honor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as
      one enters this chateau, one is struck with the good order and perfect
      keeping of everything in it&mdash;which proves, my dear sir, what
      excellent care you take of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, you flatter me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flatter you?&mdash;a poor old man like myself has something else to
      think of. But to come to business: there is a room here which is called
      the Green Chamber?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for
      a study.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have the goodness to take me there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so. After the death of
      the Count-Duke, and when the seals were removed, a number of papers were
      shut up in a cabinet in that room, and the lawyers took the keys with them
      to Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are those keys,&rdquo; said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a
      large and a small key tied together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! that is different. You come to look for papers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;for certain papers&mdash;and also far a small mahogany
      casket, with silver clasps&mdash;do you happen to know it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count&rsquo;s writing-table.
      It must be in the large, lacquered cabinet, of which you have the key.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess
      de Saint-Dizier?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so. She lives altogether above worldly things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mademoiselle Adrienne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear sir!&rdquo; said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep
      contrition and grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, sir! has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle
      Adrienne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what sense do you mean it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately!&rdquo; cried the bailiff, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, yes! for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil
      spirit of revolt and perversity&mdash;to a character which certainly has
      not its equal upon earth&mdash;it would be far better to be deprived of
      those dangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition.
      But I conjure you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this
      subject is too painful,&rdquo; said M. Rodin, with a voice of deep
      emotion, lifting the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right
      eye, as if to stop a rising tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was
      struck with the change in M. Rodin&rsquo;s voice. He answered him,
      therefore, with much sympathy: &ldquo;Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I
      really did not know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
      feeling&mdash;tears are so rare with old men&mdash;but if you had seen, as
      I have, the despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been
      too much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece&mdash;by
      which she has encouraged her&mdash;but, once more, let us talk of
      something else, my dear sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from
      his emotion, he said to Dupont: &ldquo;One part of my mission, my dear sir&mdash;that
      which relates to the Green Chamber&mdash;I have now told you; but there is
      yet another. Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a
      circumstance you have perhaps forgotten&mdash;namely, that some fifteen or
      sixteen years ago, the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny, then colonel of the
      hussars in garrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! what a dashing officer was there! It was only just now,
      that I was talking about him to my wife. He was the life of the house!&mdash;how
      well he could perform plays&mdash;particularly the character of a
      scapegrace. In the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with
      laughing, in that part of a drunken soldier&mdash;and then, with what a
      charming voice he sang Joconde, sir&mdash;better than they could sing it
      at Paris!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: &ldquo;You
      doubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious
      Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny (whose
      private secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the
      church.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/10145.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! is it possible? That fine officer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fine officer&mdash;brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and flattered&mdash;abandoned
      all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and, notwithstanding his
      name, position, high connections, his reputation as a great preacher, he
      is still what he was fourteen years ago&mdash;a plain abbe&mdash;whilst so
      many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are archbishops and
      cardinals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of
      conviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that
      M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: &ldquo;Well, sir, that is splendid
      conduct!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid? Oh, no!&rdquo; said M. Rodin, with an inimitable
      expression of simplicity; &ldquo;it is quite a matter of course when one
      has a heart like M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s. But amongst all his good
      qualities, he has particularly that of never forgetting worthy people&mdash;people
      of integrity, honor, conscience&mdash;and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he
      has not forgotten you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions
      your name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he then at Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be there soon, if not there now. He went to Italy about
      three months ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of
      news&mdash;the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of
      the estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! I was not aware of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves
      to the will of Providence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
      mention my name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell you. First of all, you must know that this house
      is sold. The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
      Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! that renews all my uneasiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as
      their bailiff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see what a lucky chance! It is just on that subject that I am
      going to speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I
      am particularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do
      all in my power to serve you, if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; &ldquo;what
      gratitude do I not owe you! It is Heaven that sends you to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell
      you, that I&rsquo;m obliged to annex a small condition to my support.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by all means! Only name it, sir&mdash;name it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in
      every way worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of
      this respectable&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir?&rdquo; said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; &ldquo;Madame
      de la Sainte Colombe the lady who has bought us out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate. My wife persists
      that she is a great lady; but&mdash;between ourselves&mdash;judging by
      certain words that I heard her speak&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont. Madame de la Sainte
      Colombe is far from being a great lady. I believe she was neither more nor
      less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais
      Royal. You see, that I deal openly with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used
      to visit her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives! However, the
      fact is, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and
      middle age&mdash;indifferent&mdash;alas! more than indifferent to the
      salvation of her soul&mdash;Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely
      way to experience grace&mdash;which renders her, as I told you, worthy of
      veneration, because nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance&mdash;always
      providing it to be lasting. Now to make the good work sure and effectual,
      we shall need your assistance, my dear M. Dupont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine, sir! what can I do in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal; and I will explain to you how. There is no church in
      this village, which stands at an equal distance from either of two
      parishes. Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of
      the two clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have
      long lived in these parts, for information respecting them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in that case the choice will soon be made. The incumbent of
      Danicourt is one of the best of men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
      Colombe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate
      of Roiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust
      herself to his care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&mdash;because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading
      Madame de la Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain
      to keep your place as bailiff. I give you my word of it, and what I
      promise I perform.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power,&rdquo; said Dupont,
      convinced by Rodin&rsquo;s manner, and the authority of his words; &ldquo;but
      I should like to know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; said Rodin, interrupting him; &ldquo;I will
      deal openly with you, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I
      beg you to support. I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow
      of an intrigue. It is only for the purpose of doing a good action. The
      curate of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      feels a deep interest. Though very poor, he has to support an aged mother.
      Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte Colombe, he would
      do more good than any one else, because he is full of zeal and patience;
      and then it is clear he would reap some little advantages, by which his
      old mother might profit&mdash;there you see is the secret of this mighty
      scheme. When I knew that this lady was disposed to buy an estate in the
      neighborhood of our friend&rsquo;s parish, I wrote about it to the
      marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to render him this
      small service, which, as you see, will not remain without a recompense.
      For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have the power to
      keep you in your place as bailiff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; replied Dupont, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, &ldquo;you are so frank and obliging, that I will imitate your
      sincerity. In the same degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected
      and loved in this country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to
      prefer to him, is dreaded for his intolerance&mdash;and, moreover&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, they say&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, what do they say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say&mdash;he is a Jesuit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
      was quite struck dumb with amazement&mdash;for the countenance of M. Rodin
      took a singular expression when he laughed. &ldquo;A Jesuit!&rdquo; he
      repeated, with redoubled hilarity; &ldquo;a Jesuit!&mdash;Now really, my
      dear M. Dupont, for a man of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can
      you believe such idle stories?&mdash;A Jesuit&mdash;are there such people
      as Jesuits?&mdash;in our time, above all, can you believe such romance of
      the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old freedom lovers?&mdash;Come, come; I
      wager, you have read about them in the Constitutionnel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, sir, they say&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! what will they not say?&mdash;But wise men, prudent
      men like you, do not meddle with what is said&mdash;they manage their own
      little matters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice,
      for the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable
      provision for the rest of their days. I tell you frankly, however much I
      may regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
      my man, you will not remain bailiff here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said poor Dupont, &ldquo;it will not be my fault,
      if this lady, hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should
      prefer him to your friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the
      neighborhood&mdash;persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every
      day&mdash;tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my
      friend, and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the
      former, and you will continue bailiff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;that would be calumny!&rdquo; cried Dupont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, my dear M. Dupont!&rdquo; said Rodin, with an air of
      sorrowful and affectionate reproach, &ldquo;how can you think me capable
      of giving you evil counsel?&mdash;I was only making a supposition. You
      wish to remain bailiff on this estate. I offer you the certainty of doing
      so&mdash;it is for you to consider and decide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more&mdash;or rather one more condition&mdash;as important
      as the other. Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the
      age and weakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves
      or others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness&mdash;but,
      in order to discharge my responsibility&mdash;and yours also, as you will
      have contributed to his appointment&mdash;I must request that you will
      write to me twice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you
      have remarked in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame
      de la Sainte Colombe&mdash;for the influence of a confessor, you see,
      reveals itself in the whole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully
      edified by the proceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it&mdash;or,
      if anything blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed
      of it by this weekly correspondence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;that would be to act as a spy?&rdquo; exclaimed the
      unfortunate bailiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear M. Dupont! how can you thus brand the sweetest, most
      wholesome of human desires&mdash;mutual confidence?&mdash;I ask of you
      nothing else&mdash;I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details
      of all that goes on here. On these two conditions, inseparable one from
      the other, you remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief
      and regret, to recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you, sir,&rdquo; said Dupont, with emotion, &ldquo;Be
      generous without any conditions!&mdash;I and my wife have only this place
      to give us bread, and we are too old to find another. Do not expose our
      probity of forty years&rsquo; standing to be tempted by the fear of want,
      which is so bad a counsellor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect
      upon this, and give me your answer in the course of a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! I implore you&mdash;&rdquo; The conversation was here
      interrupted by a loud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by
      the echoes of the cliffs. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said M. Rodin.
      Hardly had he spoken, when the same noise was again heard more distinctly
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sound of cannon,&rdquo; cried Dupont, rising; &ldquo;no
      doubt a ship in distress, or signaling for a pilot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, &ldquo;from
      the terrace, we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted&mdash;they
      are drifting right upon the shore&mdash;the ship is firing minute gulls&mdash;it
      will be lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is terrible!&rdquo; cried the bailiff, taking his hat and
      preparing to go out, &ldquo;to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do
      nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can no help be given to these vessels?&rdquo; asked M. Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them;
      since the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost with all on board?&mdash;Oh, very frightful,&rdquo; said M.
      Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no
      matter,&rdquo; said the bailiff, addressing his wife, &ldquo;I will run
      down to the rocks with the people of the farm, and try to save some of
      them, poor creatures!&mdash;Light large fires in several rooms&mdash;get
      ready linen, clothes, cordials&mdash;I scarcely dare hope to save any, but
      we must do our best. Will you come with me, M. Rodin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too
      old and feeble to be of any service,&rdquo; said M. Rodin, who was by no
      means anxious to encounter the storm. &ldquo;Your good lady will be kind
      enough to show me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I
      require, I will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. Catherine will show you. Ring the big bell,&rdquo;
      said the bailiff to his servant; &ldquo;let all the people of the farm
      meet me at the foot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; replied Catherine; &ldquo;but do not expose
      yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me&mdash;it will bring me luck,&rdquo; said the bailiff; and
      he started at a full run, crying: &ldquo;Quick! quick; by this time not a
      plank may remain of the vessels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; said Rodin, always impassible, &ldquo;will
      you be obliging enough to show me the Green Chamber?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to follow me, sir,&rdquo; answered Catherine, drying her
      tears&mdash;for she trembled on account of her husband, whose courage she
      well knew.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE TEMPEST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sea is raging.
      Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white foam, stand out, in
      high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red light, which extends
      along the horizon. Above are piled heavy masses of black and sulphurous
      vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish gray, driven by the
      violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,
      behind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique rays
      upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of the
      tallest waves. A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as the eye
      can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this dangerous
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea, rises
      Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its brick
      walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this sky
      loaded with vapors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from the
      stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast. Now she rolls her
      monstrous hull upon the waves&mdash;now plunges into their trough. A flash
      is seen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of
      the roar of the tempest. That gun is the last signal of distress from this
      lost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is
      working her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a
      distance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left. The dismasted
      ship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must
      some time pass right ahead of the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the
      enormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was
      carried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered useless.
      A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel
      amidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the
      helm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the
      ship. But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a
      greater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in
      swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent&mdash;a
      new clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship was an English vessel, the &ldquo;Black Eagle,&rdquo; homeward
      bound from Alexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java,
      via the Red Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the
      steamship &ldquo;Ruyter.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Black Eagle,&rdquo; quitting
      the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone to touch at the Azores. She headed
      thence for Portsmouth, when she was overtaken in the Channel by the
      northwester. The steamer was the &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; coming from
      Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in the last place, for Hamburg to
      Havre.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide and
      tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed. The deck
      of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and passengers
      appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea broke on jagged
      rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the &ldquo;Black Eagle,&rdquo; standing on the poop,
      holding by the remnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful
      extremity with courageous coolness. The smaller boats had been carried
      away by the waves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the
      only chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
      pieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the
      land by means of a life-line&mdash;almost the last resort for passing
      between the shore and a stranded vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented the
      general confusion. Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging
      convulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid
      insensibility. Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the
      deck uttering horrible imprecations. Here, women knelt down to pray;
      there, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the
      awful approach of death. A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her
      child clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to
      sailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that would
      take charge of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
      resignation of the sailors. Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
      danger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes, waiting
      for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with the fury
      of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death with
      stoical indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so
      express it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper
      colored complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,
      contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
      peculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,
      he leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against one
      of the bulkheads. Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child in her
      arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to several of
      the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the young man with
      the copper-colored complexion, threw herself on her knees before him, and
      lifted her child towards him with a burst of inexpressible agony. The
      young man took it, mournfully shook his head, and pointed to the furious
      waves&mdash;but, with a meaning gesture, he appeared to promise that he
      would at least try to save it. Then the young mother, in a mad transport
      of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and bathed it with her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further on, another passenger of the &ldquo;Black Eagle,&rdquo; seemed
      animated by sentiments of the most active pity. One would hardly have
      given him five-and-twenty years of age. His long, fair locks fell in curls
      on either side of his angelic countenance. He wore a black cassock and
      white neck-band. Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went
      from one to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and
      resignation; to hear him console some, and encourage others, in language
      full of unction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have
      supposed him unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity, a
      religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to time,
      he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude, love, and
      serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of those
      formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may devote
      himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all, at least
      die with them, pointing to the sky. One might almost have taken him for an
      angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of inexorable fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange contrast! not far from this young man&rsquo;s angelic beauty,
      there was another being, who resembled an evil spirit!
    </p>
    <p>
      Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by
      means of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible
      scene that was passing on the deck. A grim, wild joy lighted up his
      countenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from
      the union of the white race with the East. He wore only a shirt and linen
      drawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,
      similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,
      or to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly approaching&mdash;a
      terrible collision, which would probably cause the two vessels to founder
      before even they touched the rocks&mdash;the more did the infernal joy of
      this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports. He seemed to long,
      with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work of destruction
      should be accomplished. To see him thus feasting with avidity on all the
      agony, the terror, and the despair of those around him, one might have
      taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary deities, who, in
      barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the &ldquo;Black Eagle,&rdquo; driven by the wind and waves,
      came so near the &ldquo;William Tell&rdquo; that the passengers on the
      deck of the nearly dismantled steamer were visible from the first-named
      vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      These passengers were no longer numerous. The heavy sea, which stove in
      the paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly
      the whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant
      by this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and
      every time bore away with them some fresh victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be
      hurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,
      one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.
      Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray
      moustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope
      round his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his
      breast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of
      reindeer-skin. A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and
      barking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to
      each other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to
      heaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to
      be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.
    </p>
    <p>
      A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of both
      vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest. At the moment
      when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the steamer was
      turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a prodigious
      height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended over the
      &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; during the second which preceded the shock of
      the two vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to describe
      them. Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought, one
      catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and fleeting, as
      if illumined by a flash of lightning.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10233m.jpg" alt="10233m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10233.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Thus, when the &ldquo;Black Eagle,&rdquo; poised aloft by the flood, was
      about to crash down upon the &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; the young man
      with the angelic countenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of
      the ship, ready to cast himself into the sea to save some victim.
      Suddenly, he perceived on board the steamer, on which he looked down from
      the summit of the immense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards
      him in supplication. They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with
      a sort of ecstacy and religious homage!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the
      approaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met. The features
      of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the
      maidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their
      expected Saviour. The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay
      helpless on the deck. Soon all disappeared together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fearful mass of water dashed the &ldquo;Black Eagle&rdquo; down upon the
      &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam. To
      the dreadful crash of the two great bodies of wood and iron, which
      splintering against one another, instantly foundered, one loud cry was
      added&mdash;a cry of agony and death&mdash;the cry of a hundred human
      creatures swallowed up at once by the waves!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;nothing more was visible!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
      trough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves&mdash;with here and there
      the contracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy
      wretches, striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the
      risk of being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE SHIPWRECK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the bailiff
      was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of the passengers who
      might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin, conducted by
      Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles that he was
      to take with him to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate of
      the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the
      inhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly occupied
      by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery. When he entered
      it he found nobody there. Under his arm he held a casket, with silver
      fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red morocco
      portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned great
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      secretary been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile,
      his features would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was
      under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts. Having placed the
      casket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus communed
      with himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;All goes well. It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know. Fortunately, the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her. Her fate will be a cruel one; it
must be so. Those proud, independent characters are at all times our
natural enemies&mdash;they are so by their very essence&mdash;how much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous! As for La Sainte
Colombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool
calls his conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood, he will not hesitate. I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.
Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.
The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand:
in their youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others
serve him; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this
fear must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville,
which, from its isolated position, will make us an excellent college.
All then goes well. As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of
February approaches, without news from Joshua&mdash;evidently, Prince Djalma
is still kept prisoner by the English in the heart of India, or I must
have received letters from Batavia. The daughters of General Simon will
be detained at Leipsic for at least a month longer. All our foreign
relations are in the best condition. As for our internal affairs&mdash;&rdquo;

 Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she to the servant, &ldquo;light a fire in the
      next room; put this warm wine there; your master may be in every minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear madam,&rdquo; said Rodin to her, &ldquo;do they hope
      to save any of these poor creatures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I do not know, sir. My husband has been gone nearly two
      hours. I am terribly uneasy on his account. He is so courageous, so
      imprudent, if once he thinks he can be of any service.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courageous even to imprudence,&rdquo; said Rodin to himself,
      impatiently; &ldquo;I do not like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Catherine, &ldquo;I have here at hand my hot
      linen, my cordials&mdash;heaven grant it may all be of use!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may at least hope so, my dear madam. I very much regretted that
      my age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband. I
      also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to
      wish him joy if successful&mdash;for I am unfortunately compelled to
      depart, my moments are precious. I shall be much obliged if you will have
      the carriage got ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont. You are a woman of sense,
      and excellent judgment. Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if
      he will, his situation as bailiff of the estate&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible? What gratitude do we not owe you! Without this
      place what would become of us at our time of life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only saddled my promise with two conditions&mdash;mere
      trifles&mdash;he will explain all that to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir! we shall regard you as our deliverer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good. Only, on two little conditions&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them. Think
      what we should be without this place&mdash;penniless&mdash;absolutely
      penniless!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will
      try to persuade him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missus! I say, missus! here&rsquo;s master come back,&rdquo; cried
      a servant, rushing into the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he many with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, missus; he is alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone! alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite alone, missus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were
      streaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he had
      tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted under
      his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I have thee, my dear love!&rdquo; cried his wife, tenderly
      embracing him. &ldquo;I have been so uneasy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to the present moment&mdash;THREE SAVED.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised, my dear M. Dupont!&rdquo; said Rodin; &ldquo;at
      least your efforts will not have been all in vain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three, only three?&rdquo; said Catherine. &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of
      Goelands. Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?&rdquo;
      asked Rodin, who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people. As they
      cannot walk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the
      necessary measures for their reception. First of all, my dear, you must
      get ready some women&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two girls&mdash;fifteen or sixteen years of age at the
      most&mdash;mere children&mdash;and so pretty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little things!&rdquo; said Rodin, with an affectation of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person to whom they owe their lives is with them. He is a real
      hero!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hero?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; only fancy&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me all this by and by. Just slip on this dry warm
      dressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine. You are wet through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death. I was
      telling you that the person who saved these young girls was a hero; and
      certainly his courage was beyond anything one could have imagined. When I
      left here with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path,
      and arrived at the foot of the cliff&mdash;near the little creek of
      Goelands, fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six
      enormous masses of rock stretching out into the sea. Well, what should we
      find there? Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their
      feet still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as
      though they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from
      the sea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear children! it is quite touching!&rdquo; said M. Rodin, raising,
      as usual, the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as
      though to dry a tear, which was very seldom visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What struck me was their great resemblance to each other,&rdquo;
      resumed the bailiff; &ldquo;only one in the habit of seeing them could
      tell the difference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twin&mdash;sisters, no doubt,&rdquo; said Madame Dupont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the poor things,&rdquo; continued the bailiff, &ldquo;held
      between her clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from
      her neck by a chain of the same material.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
      words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
      spread itself over his livid cheeks. In any other person, these symptoms
      would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
      long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
      ordinary excitement. Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a slightly
      agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: &ldquo;It was
      doubtless a pious relic. Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I did not think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the two young girls were like one another&mdash;very much like,
      you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like, that one would hardly know which was which. Probably they
      are orphans, for they are dressed in mourning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dressed in mourning?&rdquo; said M. Rodin, with another start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! orphans so young!&rdquo; said Madame Dupont, wiping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place
      where the sand was quite dry. While we were busy about this, we saw the
      head of a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to
      climb, clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick
      of time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of
      our men. It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content
      with having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
      attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst the
      rocks and breakers&mdash;but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
      of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
      which he clung.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must indeed be a fine fellow!&rdquo; said Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
      this conversation. The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
      only increased upon reflection. The two girls, who had just been saved,
      were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
      one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
      with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
      of General Simon. But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
      shipwrecked passengers? How could they have escaped from the prison at
      Leipsic? How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it? Could
      they have fled, or had they been set at liberty? How was it possible that
      he should not be apprise of such an event? But these secondary thoughts,
      which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were swallowed
      up in the one fact: &ldquo;the daughters of General Simon are here!&rdquo;&mdash;His
      plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls,&rdquo; resumed
      the bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin&rsquo;s
      absence of mind, &ldquo;you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?&mdash;well,
      he is altogether the reverse. He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
      face, and light, curling locks. I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
      had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
      worsted stockings&mdash;which struck me as singular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it was certainly not a sailor&rsquo;s dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a
      Frenchman, for he speaks our language as well as we do. What brought the
      tears to my eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to
      themselves. As soon as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet,
      and seemed to look up to him and thank him, as one would pray. Then they
      cast their eyes around them, as if in search of some other person, and,
      having exchanged a few words, they fell sobbing into each other&rsquo;s
      arms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dreadful thing it is! How many poor creatures must have
      perished!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven
      dead bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages. I spoke to
      some of the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and
      if, as I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought
      here. But surely that is the sound of voices!&mdash;yes, it is our
      shipwrecked guests!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room&mdash;that door,
      which opened on the long gallery&mdash;whilst Rodin, biting convulsively
      his flat nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the
      strangers. A touching picture soon presented itself to his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by several
      windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly. This
      group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to whom
      they owed their lives. Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
      deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
      on their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
      this man made him appear younger. His long, fair hair, parted on the
      forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
      with which he had been covered. It would be difficult to describe the
      adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
      most ideal creations of Raphael&rsquo;s pencil&mdash;for that divine
      artist alone could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite
      features, the serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue
      as those of an archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, of a martyr! for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
      head. Piteous sight to see! just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
      still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
      wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
      forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!) his hands had been
      cruelly pierced by a crucifixion&mdash;his feet had suffered the same
      injury&mdash;and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that
      his wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
      the adopted son of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife. He was a priest and martyr&mdash;for,
      in our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars
      flung the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, in our days, the children of the people&mdash;for it is almost always
      amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be found&mdash;the
      children of the people, led by an honorable conviction, because it is
      courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to try and propagate
      their faith, and brave both torture and death with the most unpretending
      valor.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
      and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!&mdash;And
      for these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith
      and their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
      seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church. Never
      does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
      limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.(8)
    </p>
    <p>
      In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
      they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
      to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
      sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
      were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
      were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
      from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
      they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
      to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
      climb the rocks. Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
      soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
      one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
      nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
      such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
      General Simon&rsquo;s daughters, was a little softened. It must not be
      forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of February,
      was essential to the success of Rodin&rsquo;s projects.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
      approached them with eagerness. Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
      crying: &ldquo;Sir! sir! good news&mdash;two more saved from the wreck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessing and praise to God for it!&rdquo; said the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; asked the bailiff, hastening towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin;
      the other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
      litter made of branches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will run and have him placed in the room below,&rdquo; said the
      bailiff, as he went out. &ldquo;Catherine, you can look to the young
      ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the shipwrecked man who can walk&mdash;where is he?&rdquo;
      asked the bailiff&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said the peasant, pointing to some one who came
      rapidly along the gallery; &ldquo;when he heard that the two young ladies
      were safe in the chateau&mdash;though he is old, and wounded in the head,
      he took such great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
      springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door. They arrived there at
      the same moment as Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
      threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
      Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
      orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
      altogether, but for the care of the peasants. In spite of the observations
      of the bailiff&rsquo;s wife, on their state of weakness and agitation, the
      two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was carried
      fainting into an adjoining apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the soldier, Rodin&rsquo;s face was again violently
      contracted, for he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters was dead. The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning
      upon a chair, and had not yet perceived Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
      room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him. This
      man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
      approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
      accent: &ldquo;Prince Djalma has just been brought in here. His first word
      was to ask for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that man say?&rdquo; cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder;
      for, at the name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel&rsquo;s
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin!&rdquo; exclaimed the missionary, falling back in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin,&rdquo; cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that
      moment, he kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here, sir?&rdquo; said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air
      of deference, not unmixed with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did that man say to you?&rdquo; repeated Rodin, in an excited
      tone. &ldquo;Did he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the
      English ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been
      wrecked. This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship
      that brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
      being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
      embarked on board the &lsquo;Black Eagle,&rsquo; where I met Prince
      Djalma. We were bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to
      proceed to France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin did not care to interrupt Gabriel. This new shock had completely
      paralyzed his thoughts. At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
      which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: &ldquo;Can you
      tell me who this Prince Djalma is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man as good as brave&mdash;the son of an East Indian king,
      dispossessed of his territory by the English.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
      him with anxious interest: &ldquo;How is the Prince? are his wounds
      dangerous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal,&rdquo;
      answered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said the missionary, addressing Rodin;
      &ldquo;here, you see, is another saved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go see him,&rdquo; said Gabriel, submissively. &ldquo;You
      have no orders to give me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
      notwithstanding your fatigue?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be necessary&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary. You will go with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair, while
      the missionary went out with the peasant. The man with the sallow
      complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
      Stranglers. Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
      Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
      despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
      by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
      &ldquo;Ruyter.&rdquo; When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi,
      he had not been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on
      shipboard, after his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not
      knowing that he belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the
      voyage as a fellow-countryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
      biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
      caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
      shoulder, said to him: &ldquo;Your name is Rodin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked the other, starting, and raising his head
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Rodin?&rdquo; repeated Faringhea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But, once more, what do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
      passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
      before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.
    </p>
    <p>
      (8) We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
      three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
      of poor parents in Beauce. He was writing to his mother from the heart of
      Japan, and thus concluded his letter: &ldquo;Adieu, my dear mother! they
      say there is much danger where I am now sent to. Pray for me, and tell all
      our good neighbors that I think of them very often.&rdquo; These few
      words, addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of
      France, are only the more touching from their very simplicity&mdash;E. S.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. THE DEPARTURE FOR PARIS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he most profound
      silence reigns throughout Cardoville House. The tempest has lulled by
      degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse murmur of the
      waves, as they wash heavily the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
      apartments on the first-floor of the chateau. Djalma, too severely hurt to
      be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below. At the moment of the
      shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms. He had
      failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
      death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
      thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces. Faringhea, who has
      been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
      chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
      ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
      his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
      placed in front of a bright coal-fire. His apartment is situated near
      those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
      quitted the door of Rose and Blanche&rsquo;s chamber, to lie down and warm
      himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.
      There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a feeling
      of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and sea. We
      will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old Jovial;
      unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
      irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with, ever
      since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was the most
      inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
      entered timidly. Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
      themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert; though
      the bailiff&rsquo;s wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
      again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
      hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
      the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
      sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing their
      canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert reposing
      there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe. To their great astonishment,
      they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion, not daring to
      advance or recede, for fear of waking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
      naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion was
      the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of the
      damask covering of the arm-chair. His beautiful countenance expressed a
      profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful dream,
      or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some sad
      regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
      sleeping. Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
      preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with an
      inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering goodness.
      The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed simultaneously, and
      exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each other the slumbering
      missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sleeps, sister,&rdquo; said Rose in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; replied Blanche, also in a whisper,
      making a sign of caution; &ldquo;we shall now be able to observe him well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! what a sweet countenance!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he promised he would protect us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has not failed us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here, at least, he is visible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;he has again rescued us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without him, we should have perished this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
      shone with light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then he had not so sad a mien.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! we should have certainly perceived it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these other marks on his hands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, sister? If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or
      in helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. If he did not run any danger for those he protects,
      it would be less noble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity that he does not open his eye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their expression is so good, so tender!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now we are alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were to pray to him to speak to us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
      bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
      beneath their black dresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Let us kneel down to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister! our hearts beat so!&rdquo; said Blanche, believing
      rightly, that Rose felt exactly as she did. &ldquo;And yet it seems to do
      us good. It is as if some happiness were going to befall us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
      clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young priest.
      It was a charming picture. Turning their lovely faces towards him, they
      said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to their
      youthful appearance: &ldquo;Gabriel! speak to us of our mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
      and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
      beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
      voices repeat his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who calls me?&rdquo; said he, rousing himself, and raising his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Blanche and Rose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Gabriel&rsquo;s turn to blush, for he recognized the young
      girls he had saved. &ldquo;Rise, my sisters!&rdquo; said he to them;
      &ldquo;you should kneel only unto God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
      hand. &ldquo;You know my name, it seems,&rdquo; said the missionary with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have not forgotten it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told it you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;when you came from our mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, my sisters?&rdquo; said the missionary, unable to comprehend the
      words of the orphans. &ldquo;You are mistaken. I saw you to-day for the
      first time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in our dreams?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;do you not remember?&mdash;in our dreams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Germany&mdash;three months ago, for the first time. Look at us
      well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
      expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
      perplexed, he repeated: &ldquo;In your dreams?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
      remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in
      that dark night, when we were not able to see you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of
      our old friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although
      he would not believe in angels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we expected you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning&mdash;yes, my sisters&mdash;it pleased heaven to send
      me to your assistance. I was coming from America, but I have never been in
      Leipsic. I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison. Tell me, my
      sisters,&rdquo; added he, with a benevolent smile, &ldquo;for whom do you
      take me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our
      mother from heaven to protect us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest. It is by mere chance, no
      doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
      dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner&mdash;for angels
      are not visible to mortal eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angels are not visible?&rdquo; said the orphans, looking
      sorrowfully at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, my dear sisters,&rdquo; said Gabriel, taking them
      affectionately by the hand; &ldquo;dreams, like everything else, come from
      above. Since the remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream,
      it is twice blessed.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance. Up to this
      time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
      archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert&rsquo;s wife
      had adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
      priest and missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
      blank wound (to use a term of General Simon&rsquo;s), had allowed it to be
      carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
      bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
      natural grimness of his features. On entering the room, he was not a
      little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
      familiarly in his own. This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
      know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
      attempted to save his also.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
      to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very imperfectly,
      at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain death, the
      young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid. And when,
      after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety beneath the
      roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated, into a swoon,
      caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his wound&mdash;so that he
      had again no opportunity of observing the features of the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
      brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
      sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
      filial caresses. His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
      affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
      glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
      countenance he could not well distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is your wound?&rdquo; asked Rose, anxiously. &ldquo;They told
      us it was not dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it still pain?&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in
      this manner. If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have
      more wrappings. They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
      wound, and I have a good mind to&mdash;&rdquo; And therewith the soldier
      raised one of his hands to the bandage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you leave that alone?&rdquo; cried Rose catching his arm.
      &ldquo;How can you be so unreasonable&mdash;at your age?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! don&rsquo;t scold! I will do what you wish, and keep it
      on.&rdquo; Then, drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to
      them in a low voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner
      of his eye: &ldquo;Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I
      came in? He has very much the look of a curate. You see, my children, you
      must be on your guard; because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He?&rdquo; cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel.
      &ldquo;Without him, we should not now be here to kiss you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up
      his tall figure, and gazing full at the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our guardian angel,&rdquo; resumed Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without him,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;we must have perished this
      morning in the shipwreck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is he, who&mdash;&rdquo; Dagobert could say no more. With
      swelling heart, and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered
      him both his hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to
      describe: &ldquo;Sir, I owe you the lives of these two children. I feel
      what a debt that service lays upon me. I will not say more&mdash;because
      it includes everything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: &ldquo;Stop! when
      I was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the
      waves, was it not you that held out your hand to me? Yes&mdash;that light
      hair&mdash;that youthful countenance&mdash;yes&mdash;it was certainly you&mdash;now
      I am sure of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see
      you fall back into the sea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have
      already said,&rdquo; answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: &ldquo;in
      preserving these children you have done more for me than if you had saved
      my own life. But what heart and courage!&rdquo; added the soldier, with
      admiration; &ldquo;and so young, with such a girlish look!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; cried Blanche, joyfully, &ldquo;our Gabriel came to
      your aid also?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing
      himself to the priest. &ldquo;Is your name Gabriel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.
      &ldquo;And a priest!&rdquo; added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest of the foreign missions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who brought you up?&rdquo; asked the soldier, with
      increasing astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of
      mothers: for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as
      her son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances Baudoin&mdash;was it not?&rdquo; said the soldier, with
      deep emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, sir,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn.
      &ldquo;But how do you know this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wife of a soldier, eh?&rdquo; continued Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of a brave soldier&mdash;who, from the most admirable
      devotion, is even now passing his life in exile&mdash;far from his wife&mdash;far
      from his son, my dear brother&mdash;for I am proud to call him by that
      name&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Agricola!&mdash;my wife!&mdash;when did you leave them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it possible! You the father of Agricola?&mdash;Oh! I knew
      not, until now,&rdquo; cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, &ldquo;I
      knew not all the gratitude that I owed to heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my wife! my child!&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, in a trembling
      voice; &ldquo;how are they? have you news of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is too much,&rdquo; cried Dagobert; &ldquo;it is too much!&rdquo;
      The veteran was unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and
      fell back exhausted in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father&rsquo;s
      letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of Dagobert
      had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Gabriel is the same as yours&mdash;what happiness!&rdquo; cried
      Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my children! he belongs to you as well as to me. We have all
      our part in him.&rdquo; Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
      affectionate warmth: &ldquo;Your hand, my brave boy! give me your hand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! you are too good to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;thank me!&mdash;after all thou has
      done for us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does my adopted mother know of your return?&rdquo; asked Gabriel,
      anxious to escape from the praises of the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come
      alone; there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by. Does she
      still live in the Rue Brise-Miche? It was there Agricola was born.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She still lives there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, she must have received my letter. I wished to write
      to her from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From prison! Have you just come out of prison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I
      should be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had
      a hand in&mdash;a good sort of devil, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Pray explain to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself. These
      little ladies,&rdquo; he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche,
      &ldquo;pretended to know more about it than I did, and were continually
      repeating: &lsquo;It was the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert&mdash;the
      good angel we told thee of&mdash;though you said you would rather have
      Spoil sport to defend us&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, I am waiting for you,&rdquo; said a stern voice, which
      made the missionary start. They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog
      uttered a deep growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Rodin. He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor. His
      features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
      at the soldier and sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in
      favor of Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive. &ldquo;What
      the mischief does he want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go with him,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
      constraint. Then, turning to Rodin, he added: &ldquo;A thousand pardons! I
      shall be ready in a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, &ldquo;going
      the very instant we have just met? No, by my faith! you shall not go. I
      have too much to tell you, and to ask in return. We will make the journey
      together. It will be a real treat for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible. He is my superior, and I must obey him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your superior?&mdash;why, he&rsquo;s in citizen&rsquo;s dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! since he is not in uniform, and there is no
      provost-marshal in your troop, send him to the&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
      remain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right in disliking the phi of that man,&rdquo; muttered
      Dagobert between his teeth. Then he added, with an air of impatience and
      vexation: &ldquo;Shall I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching
      off by himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you not to do so,&rdquo; said Gabriel; &ldquo;it would be
      useless; I know my duty, and have no will but my superior&rsquo;s. As soon
      as you arrive in Paris, I will come and see you, as also my adopted
      mother, and my dear brother, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;if it must be. I have been a soldier, and know what
      subordination is,&rdquo; said Dagobert, much annoyed. &ldquo;One must put
      a good face on bad fortune. So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue
      Brise-Miche, my boy; for they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow
      evening, and we set out almost immediately. But I say&mdash;there seems to
      be a strict discipline with you fellows!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is strict and severe,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, with a
      shudder, and a stifled sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, shake hands&mdash;and let&rsquo;s say farewell for the
      present. After all, twenty-four hours will soon pass away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu! adieu!&rdquo; replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he
      returned the friendly pressure of the veteran&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, Gabriel!&rdquo; added the orphans, sighing also, and with
      tears in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, my sisters!&rdquo; said Gabriel&mdash;and he left the room
      with Rodin, who had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
      Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
      much injured to proceed on his journey. The half-caste, Faringhea,
      remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
      countryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
      Dagobert&rsquo;s wife.

      CHAPTER XXVII. DAGOBERT&rsquo;S WIFE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following
      scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the shipwrecked
      travellers were received in Cardoville House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one end
      of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the little
      square of the Cloister, near the church. At this end, the street, or
      rather alley&mdash;for it is not more than eight feet wide&mdash;is shut
      in between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
      which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
      year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
      during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
      everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
      oblong well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish
      light of the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men,
      stopping at the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few
      words together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;you understand all about it. You are to
      watch in the street, till you see them enter No. 5.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; answered the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you see &lsquo;em enter so as to make quite sure of the
      game, go up to Frances Baudoin&rsquo;s room&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
      lives&mdash;the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and you must try and find out her address also&mdash;from
      her humpbacked sister, if possible&mdash;for it is very important. Women
      of her feather change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
      sister hangs out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, to give you steam, I&rsquo;ll wait for you at the tavern
      opposite the Cloister, and we&rsquo;ll have a go of hot wine on your
      return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it! This morning the water friz on my
      sprinkling-brush, and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the
      church-door. Ah, my boy! a distributor of holy water is not always upon
      roses!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily, you have the pickings&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;good luck to you! Don&rsquo;t forget the Fiver,
      the little passage next to the dyer&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;all right!&rdquo; and the two men separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end of
      the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry. This latter soon found
      the number of the house he sought&mdash;a tall, narrow building, having,
      like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.
      When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and forwards
      in front of the door of No. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
      of the interior cannot be described. The house No. 5 was, in a special
      degree, dirty and dilapidated. The water, which oozed from the wall,
      trickled down the dark and filthy staircase. On the second floor, a wisp
      of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
      on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
      sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
      putrid exhalations of the drains. The few openings, cut at rare intervals
      in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
      rays of glimmering light.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
      poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
      classes. The house in question was of the number. A dyer occupied the
      ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
      stench of the whole building. On the upper stories, several artisans
      lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades. Up four
      flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert. It
      consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by a
      single candle. Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/10257.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
      wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
      rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
      washed, had preserved its natural color. At one end of this room was a
      round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes. On the wooden
      table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made of
      iron&mdash;a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
      Baudoin, Dagobert&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
      branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
      coarsely colored, bore witness to the habits of the soldier&rsquo;s wife.
      Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
      fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
      green cotton velvet (Agricola&rsquo;s first present to his mother), a few
      rush bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
      brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
      worm-eaten door. The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
      household utensils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so to
      the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
      mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
      contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert&rsquo;s wife occupied all to
      herself a room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to
      honest and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together&mdash;only
      too happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets
      and blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
      damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
      Agricola&rsquo;s evening meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert&rsquo;s wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close
      jacket of blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a
      white handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.
      Her countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive
      of resignation and great kindness. It would have been difficult to find a
      better, a more courageous mother. With no resource but her labor, she had
      succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
      Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
      admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later life,
      by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most violent
      exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost suicidal.
      Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the present), by
      sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn about two
      shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to educate her son
      and her adopted child.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
      nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing, and
      had received such an education as children of the people can obtain. About
      this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and Gabriel
      prepared to enter the priest&rsquo;s seminary, under the active patronage
      of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances Baudoin
      had become very frequent about the year 1820.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those simple
      natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial approaches to
      heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life of martyrdom&mdash;pure
      and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart supply the place of
      the intellect!
    </p>
    <p>
      The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
      simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed in
      yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had now
      for many years been accustomed to submit. She regarded this influence as
      most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration, could
      have prevented her from obeying it. Did any dispute arise on the subject,
      nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every argument a
      resistance entirely free from passion&mdash;mild as her disposition, calm
      as her conscience&mdash;but, like the latter, not to be shaken. In a word,
      Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but uninstructed and credulous
      beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and dangerous hands, become,
      without knowing it, the instruments of much evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
      increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
      unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
      of her time at church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
      working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
      for her son&rsquo;s supper, with maternal care and solicitude. She took
      from the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very
      much battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
      like a knife. These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
      rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
      son&rsquo;s plate. They were the most precious of her possessions, not so
      much for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
      associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
      under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
      compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
      and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
      son&rsquo;s plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of
      the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
      mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
      redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal. After long and
      painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the conviction
      that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker, would soon be
      so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or three hours a
      day which had lately been the extent of her labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
      eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
      of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
      had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
      for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
      rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread. This work, being
      very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and her
      gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
      whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
      sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices to
      bring them in daily this miserable pittance. Thus do their gains diminish
      in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and infirmity must
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son. A first-rate
      workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
      labor brought him from four to five shillings a day&mdash;more than double
      what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments. Admitting
      therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
      both her and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself even
      some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously liberal on
      the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of visiting
      daily the parish church. Scarcely a day passed but she had masses sung, or
      tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been so long
      separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she considered
      on the high-road to perdition. Agricola had so excellent a heart, so loved
      and revered his mother, and considered her actions in this respect
      inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never complained when he saw
      a great part of his week&rsquo;s wages (which he paid regularly over to
      his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect as
      tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations injurious at
      her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional expenses. But
      what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when she replied with
      tears: &ldquo;My child, &lsquo;tis for the salvation of your father and
      yours too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a subject
      which Agricola, through respect for his mother&rsquo;s religious faith,
      never discussed. He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her dispense
      with comforts she might have enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A discreet tap was heard at the door. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Frances.
      The person came in.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he person who now
      entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very much deformed.
      Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her breast was
      sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders. Her face was regular,
      but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it expressed
      great sweetness and melancholy. Her blue eyes beamed with kindness and
      intelligence. By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest woman would
      have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse net at the
      back of her head. She held an old basket in her hand. Though miserably
      clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful struggle with
      her poverty. Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty frock made of
      print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it had been so
      often washed, that its primitive design and color had long since
      disappeared. In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a long
      familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of taunting.
      From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her. We have said that she was
      very deformed, and she was vulgarly called &ldquo;Mother Bunch.&rdquo;
      Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every moment
      reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though they felt
      as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her, never called
      her, however, by any other name.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10265m.jpg" alt="10265m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10265.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
      house in which Dagobert&rsquo;s wife had resided for more than twenty
      years; and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are wretches fatally doomed to misery. Mother Bunch had a very
      pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow of
      a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she treated
      her deformed child with contempt and unkindness. The latter would often
      come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console her, and
      in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.
      Accustomed to pity her by their mother&rsquo;s example, instead of
      imitating other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her,
      Agricola and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
      their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty. Cephyse was
      intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
      lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
      pleasures&mdash;a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.
      Cephyse, listening at first to Frances&rsquo;s good advice, resigned
      herself to her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for
      about a year. But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
      insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her to&mdash;privations
      which often bordered on starvation&mdash;Cephyse, young, pretty, of warm
      temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and seductions&mdash;brilliant,
      indeed, for her, since they offered food to satisfy her hunger, shelter
      from the cold, and decent raiment, without being obliged to work fifteen
      hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome hovel&mdash;Cephyse listened to
      the vows of a young lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, who forsook her soon after. She
      formed a connection with another clerk, whom she (instructed by the
      examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman, whom she afterwards cast
      off for other favorites. In a word, what with changing and being forsaken,
      Cephyse, in the course of one or two years, was the idol of a set of
      grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired such a reputation at the
      balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her decision of character,
      original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all kinds of pleasures, and
      especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was termed the Bacchanal
      Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of this bewildering royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
      intervals. She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
      her three-and-six a week. The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
      by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army. For
      these she received half-a-crown a dozen. They had to be hemmed, stitched,
      provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
      the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
      succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week&mdash;an
      excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
      fourpence a week. And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
      nor uncommon. And this, because the remuneration given for women&rsquo;s
      work is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism. They are
      paid not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as
      tailors, and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.&mdash;no doubt because
      women can work as well as men&mdash;because they are more weak and
      delicate&mdash;and because their need may be twofold as great when they
      become mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week. That is to say,
      toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
      keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and poverty&mdash;so
      numerous were her privations. Privations? No! The word privation expresses
      but weakly that constant and terrible want of all that is necessary to
      preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome air and shelter,
      sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing. Mortification would be a
      better word to describe that total want of all that is essentially vital,
      which a justly organized state of society ought&mdash;yes&mdash;ought
      necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman and workwoman, since
      civilization has dispossessed them of all territorial right, and left them
      no other patrimony than their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
      least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the sea,
      and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for shelter
      and for fuel. The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts, considering
      the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard daily labor,
      which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable him to live in
      the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less. For is it living,
      to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life from the grave, and
      even there continually struggle against cold, hunger, and disease? And to
      show how far the mortification which society imposes thus inexorably on
      its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its careless disregard of
      all the questions which concern the just remuneration of labor), may
      extend, we will describe how this poor girl contrived to live on three
      shillings and sixpence a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
      wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
      leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity. Yes:
      to live at such a price is virtue! Yes, society thus organized, whether it
      tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame the poor
      wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because they are
      cold and famishing. This poor girl spent her wages as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Six pounds of bread, second quality........0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water................0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt....................0 0 3/4
    A bushel of charcoal...............0 4
    A quart of dried vegetables............0 3
    Three quarts of potatoes..............0 2
    Dips........................0 3 1/4
    Thread and needles.................0 2 1/2
                                                      ______
                                                       2 7
</pre>
    <p>
      To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
      week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story. On
      other days she ate it cold. There remained nine or ten pence a week for
      clothes and lodging. By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
      respect an exception to the lot of many others. Agricola, that he might
      not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
      housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a small
      bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
      shillings a year. But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
      porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
      was twelve and sixpence. The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
      month left for her other expenses. But many workwomen, whose position is
      less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
      piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
      night patronize the &ldquo;twopenny rope,&rdquo; one with another, in a
      wretched room containing five or six beds, some of which are always
      engaged by men, as male lodgers are by far the most abundant. Yes; and in
      spite of the disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this
      arrangement, she must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have
      separate rooms for females. To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor
      workwoman must possess three or four shillings in ready money. But how
      save this sum, out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are
      scarcely sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less
      sufficient to clothe her? No! no! The poor wretch must resign herself to
      this repugnant cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty
      becomes weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from
      the &ldquo;gay life,&rdquo; becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only
      means of improving her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first
      &ldquo;man made of money,&rdquo; who can afford a governess for his
      children, cries out against the depravity of the lower orders! And yet,
      painful as the condition of the working woman is, it is relatively
      fortunate. Should work fail her for one day, two days, what then? Should
      sickness come&mdash;sickness almost always occasioned by unwholesome food,
      want of fresh air, necessary attention, and good rest; sickness, often so
      enervating as to render work impossible; though not so dangerous as to
      procure the sufferer a bed in an hospital&mdash;what becomes of the
      hapless wretches then? The mind hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on
      such gloomy pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
      often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
      this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
      whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.
      It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
      creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.
      This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
      enjoyed through Agricola&rsquo;s generosity, lived very miserably; and her
      health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
      hardships. Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
      sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
      earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service which
      it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited means of
      Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her natural
      delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
      humiliations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
      generous soul&mdash;a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
      this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
      brought up, and who had naturally the gift. This poor girl was the first
      confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
      when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
      reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
      natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
      be to her in her lonely and despised condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, to Agricola&rsquo;s great surprise, who had just read some verses
      to her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
      him also a poetic composition. Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
      perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
      entrusted to a friendly hearer. From that day Agricola and she held
      frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
      with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl&rsquo;s
      poetical essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of
      weak intellect. This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all
      her unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her
      hard lot: her note was sad, but gentle&mdash;desponding, but resigned; it
      was especially the language of deep tenderness&mdash;of mournful sympathy&mdash;of
      angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
      double burden of poverty and deformity. Yet she often expressed a sincere
      free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
      admired beauty as she admired the sun. But, alas! many were the verses of
      hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
      face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
      heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits. The young
      girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can love,
      who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in the
      depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation. She did not
      seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so? No one would
      ever know it. Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola explained the
      interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one was surprised
      at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830, Agricola,
      after fighting intrepidly for the people&rsquo;s flag, was brought
      bleeding home to his mother. Dagobert&rsquo;s son, deceived, like others,
      on this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect,
      this love for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
      preparing her son&rsquo;s supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, my poor love,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have not seen
      you since morning: have you been ill? Come and kiss me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl kissed Agricola&rsquo;s mother, and replied: &ldquo;I was
      very busy about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have
      only just finished it. I am going down to fetch some charcoal&mdash;do you
      want anything while I&rsquo;m out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my child, thank you. But I am very uneasy. It is half-past
      eight, and Agricola is not come home.&rdquo; Then she added, after a sigh:
      &ldquo;He kills himself with work for me. Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl;
      my sight is quite going. In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I
      cannot see at all&mdash;not even to sew sacks. The idea of being a burden
      to my son drives me distracted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am, if Agricola heard you say that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
      vexation. Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
      advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy&rsquo;s, his good and
      worthy master&mdash;instead of living in this dull garret, where it is
      scarcely light at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very
      little expense, a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a
      view of the garden. And he is so fond of trees! not to mention that this
      place is so far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs. Baudoin,&rdquo;
      said Mother Bunch; &ldquo;besides, he knows how you cling to the house in
      which he was born. M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola,
      in the building put up for the workmen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child; but then I must give up church. I can&rsquo;t do
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;be easy, I hear him,&rdquo; said the hunchback, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;ll not let him see that I have been crying,&rdquo;
      said the good mother, drying her tears. &ldquo;This is the only moment of
      rest and ease from toil he has&mdash;I must not make it sad to him.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIX. AGRICOLA BAUDOIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ur blacksmith
      poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of age, was alert and
      robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and aquiline nose, and
      an open, expressive countenance. His resemblance to Dagobert was rendered
      more striking by the thick brown moustache which he wore according to the
      fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his chin. His cheeks,
      however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a blue blouse,
      bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly round his
      muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his dress. The
      only thing which contrasted singularly with his working habiliments was a
      handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he held in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, mother,&rdquo; said he, as he came to kiss Frances
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a friendly nod, he added, &ldquo;Good-evening, Mother Bunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very late, my child,&rdquo; said Frances, approaching the
      little stove on which her son&rsquo;s simple meal was simmering; &ldquo;I
      was getting very anxious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?&rdquo; said
      Agricola, gayly. &ldquo;The deuce! you won&rsquo;t excuse me for keeping
      the nice little supper waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it
      should be spoilt, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done, you naughty boy; you&rsquo;ll make me upset the pan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully. Let&rsquo;s
      see what it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait half a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and
      bacon I&rsquo;m so fond of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being Saturday, of course!&rdquo; said Frances, in a tone of mild
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent
      cunning with Mother Bunch; &ldquo;but, talking of Saturday, mother, here
      are my wages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was
      about to put away the money, &ldquo;what a handsome flower you have in
      your hand, Agricola. I never saw a finer. In winter, too! Do look at it,
      Mrs. Baudoin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See there, mother,&rdquo; said Agricola, taking the flower to her;
      &ldquo;look at it, admire it, and especially smell it. You can&rsquo;t
      have a sweeter perfume; a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it does smell nice, child. Goodness! how handsome!&rdquo;
      said Frances, admiringly; &ldquo;where did you find it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find it, my good mother!&rdquo; repeated Agricola, smilingly:
      &ldquo;do you think folks pick up such things between the Barriere du
      Maine and the Rue Brise-Miche?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get it then?&rdquo; inquired the sewing girl, sharing
      in Frances&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you would like to know? Well, I&rsquo;ll satisfy you, and
      explain why I came home so late; for something else detained me. It has
      been an evening of adventures, I promise you. I was hurrying home, when I
      heard a low, gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was
      just about dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger
      than my fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered
      its paws.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost, poor thing, I warrant,&rdquo; said Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it. I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick
      my hands. Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but
      as that did not bear the master&rsquo;s name, I looked beneath it, and saw
      a small collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains. So I took a
      Lucifer match from my &lsquo;bacco-box, and striking a light, I read,
      &lsquo;FRISKY belongs to Hon. Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No. 7, Rue de
      Babylone.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were just in the street,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me
      till I came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found
      a small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
      the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park. So,
      looking up I saw &lsquo;No. 7,&rsquo; newly painted over a little door
      with a grated slide. I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in
      observing me through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping
      through), the gate opened. And now, you&rsquo;ll not believe a word I have
      to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, my child?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it seems like a fairy tale.&rdquo;
    </p>

      <a href="images/10273.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fairy tale?&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her
      namesake of elfish history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For, all the world it does. I am quite astounded, even now, at my
      adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us have it,&rdquo; said the worthy mother, so deeply
      interested that she did not perceive her son&rsquo;s supper was beginning
      to burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had
      excited, &ldquo;a young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so
      beautifully and gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a
      beautiful portrait of past times. Before I could say a word, she
      exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah! dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how
      happy Miss Adrienne will be! Come, pray come in instantly; she would so
      regret not having an opportunity to thank you in person!&rsquo; And
      without giving me time to reply, she beckoned me to follow her. Oh, dear
      mother, it is quite out of my power to tell you, the magnificence I saw,
      as I passed through a small saloon, partially lighted, and full of
      perfume! It would be impossible. The young woman walked too quickly. A
      door opened,&mdash;Oh, such a sight! I was so dazzled I can remember
      nothing but a great glare of gold and light, crystal and flowers; and,
      amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady of extreme beauty&mdash;ideal
      beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair shining like gold! Oh! it was
      charming to look at! I never saw such hair before. She had black eyes,
      ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as snow. This is all I can
      recollect: for, as I said before, I was so dazzled, I seemed to be looking
      through a veil. &lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said the young woman, whom I never
      should have taken for a lady&rsquo;s-maid, she was dressed so elegantly,
      &lsquo;here is Frisky. This gentleman found him, and brought him back.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Oh, sir,&rsquo; said the young lady with the golden hair, in a
      sweet silvery voice, &lsquo;what thanks I owe you! I am foolishly attached
      to Frisky.&rsquo; Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought
      to thank me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and
      said to me, though I must confess with some hesitation&mdash;&lsquo;No
      doubt, sir, it gave you some trouble to bring my pet back. You have,
      perhaps, lost some valuable time&mdash;allow me&mdash;&rsquo; She held
      forth her purse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Agricola,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, sadly; &ldquo;how people
      may be deceived!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady. Seeing
      by my looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
      porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
      full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
      at having wounded me, she said&mdash;&lsquo;At least, sir, you will accept
      this flower.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Agricola,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling sadly;
      &ldquo;an involuntary error could not be repaired in a nicer way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy young lady,&rdquo; said Frances, wiping her eyes; &ldquo;how
      well she understood my Agricola!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she not, mother? But just as I was taking the flower, without
      daring to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady&rsquo;s kind
      manner, there was something very imposing about her) another handsome
      girl, tall and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said
      to the red-haired young lady, &lsquo;He is here, Madame.&rsquo; She
      immediately rose and said to me, &lsquo;A thousand pardons, sir. I shall
      never forget that I am indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure. Pray
      remember, on all occasions, my address and name&mdash;Adrienne de
      Cardoville.&rsquo; Thereupon she disappeared. I could not find a word to
      say in reply. The same young woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to
      me very politely. And there I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and
      astonished as if I had come out of an enchanted palace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale. Is it not, my poor girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner
      that Agricola did not observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What affected me most,&rdquo; rejoined Agricola, &ldquo;was, that
      the young lady, on seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as
      many would have done in her place, and took no notice of it before me.
      That shows delicacy and feeling, does it not? Indeed, I believe this young
      lady to be so kind and generous, that I should not hesitate to have
      recourse to her in any important case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; replied the sempstress, more and more
      absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl suffered extremely. She felt no jealousy, no hatred, towards
      this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy, seemed to
      belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within the reach
      of a work, girl&rsquo;s vision; but, making an involuntary comparison of
      this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt more
      cruelly her deformity and poverty. Yet such were the humility and gentle
      resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made her
      feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
      purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
      atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply. Yet her heart was
      ready to break. She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
      magnificent flower&mdash;so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
      charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother,&rdquo; resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of
      the painful emotion of the other bystander, &ldquo;you have had the cream
      of my adventures first. I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and
      now for the other. Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the
      foot of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green. Stopping me he said,
      with an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap
      sneaking about the house like a spy, &lsquo;Well, what is that to you,
      Daddy Loriot?&rsquo; said I: &lsquo;are you afraid he will nose out the
      way to make the beautiful green, with which you are dyed up to the very
      elbows?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who could that man be, Agricola?&rdquo; said Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word, mother, I don&rsquo;t know and scarcely care; I tried
      to persuade Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his
      cellar, since it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy
      watched him or not.&rdquo; So saying, Agricola went and placed the little
      leathern sack, containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
      recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
      the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-&ldquo;Agricola&mdash;for
      your hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, little sister. How kind you are!&rdquo; Then with a most
      unaffected gesture and tone, he added, &ldquo;There is my fine flower for
      your trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you give it me?&rdquo; cried the sempstress, with emotion, while
      a vivid blush colored her pale and interesting face. &ldquo;Do you give me
      this handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and
      graciously gave you?&rdquo; And the poor thing repeated, with growing
      astonishment, &ldquo;Do you give it to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce should I do with it? Wear it on my heart, have it
      set as a pin?&rdquo; said Agricola, smiling. &ldquo;It is true I was very
      much impressed by the charming way in which the young lady thanked me. I
      am delighted to think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to
      give you this flower, since it pleases you. You see the day has been a
      happy one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
      the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke and
      steel filings that the water became dark in an instant. Agricola, pointing
      out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper, laughing,-&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      cheap ink for us paper-stainers! I finished some verses yesterday, which I
      am rather satisfied with. I will read them to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
      while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
      the flower against the side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you ask for a towel,&rdquo; said Frances, shrugging her
      shoulders, &ldquo;instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
      better for a little cooling to-night, won&rsquo;t it? Am I disobedient,
      mother? Scold me, then, if you dare! Come, let us see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son&rsquo;s
      head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
      surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
      on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;sit down: you stand all day at your
      forge, and it is late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&mdash;your arm-chair again!&rdquo; said Agricola.&mdash;&ldquo;Our
      usual quarrel every evening&mdash;take it away, I shall be quite as much
      at ease on another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tyranny!&rdquo; said Agricola gayly, sitting down. &ldquo;Well,
      I preach like a good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair,
      after all. Since I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never
      had a better seat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
      for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.
      There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
      excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sup with me?&rdquo; said Agricola to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Agricola,&rdquo; replied the sempstress, looking down,
      &ldquo;I have only just dined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I only ask you for form&rsquo;s sake&mdash;you have your whims&mdash;we
      can never prevail on you to eat with us&mdash;just like mother; she
      prefers dining all alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my
      knowing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness, child! It is better for my health to dine early. Well, do
      you find it nice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice!&mdash;call it excellent! Stockfish and parsnips. Oh, I am
      very fond of stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
      day&rsquo;s toil, with this paltry stew,&mdash;a little burnt as it had
      been, too, during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by
      observing the fast without complaining. He affected to enjoy his meal; and
      the good woman accordingly observed with satisfaction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we&rsquo;ll
      have some more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, mother,&mdash;only not two days together. One gets tired
      of luxuries, you know! And now, let us talk of what we shall do to-morrow&mdash;Sunday.
      We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem very sad, dear
      mother, and I can&rsquo;t make it out&mdash;I fancy you are not satisfied
      with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear child!&mdash;you&mdash;the pattern of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a
      little amusement. Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as
      you did last time,&rdquo; added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
      bitter grief, and she made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child,&rdquo;
      said Frances to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the evening, then? I don&rsquo;t propose the theatre; but
      they say there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear mother, this is unreasonable!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, dear mother; forgive me. Well, then, if it should be fine, we
      will simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards. It is nearly
      three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
      us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; go alone, my child. Enjoy your Sunday, &lsquo;tis little
      enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well, Agricola,&rdquo; said the sempstress, blushing
      up to the eyes, &ldquo;that I ought not to go out with you and your mother
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, madame? May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
      refusal?&rdquo; said Agricola gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, &ldquo;Because I will not expose
      you to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and
      he struck his forehead vexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
      punctilious discretion. The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
      mother. Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her. Many days and
      nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
      might not do discredit to her friends. The five or six days of holidays,
      thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
      of her happy days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
      the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man retorted
      it by saying,-&ldquo;What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
      stoopid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
      to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary to
      avenge an insult. Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola left
      his mother&rsquo;s arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
      size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
      fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face. The villain
      attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
      amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
      hisses. This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
      Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel. We may
      conceive the blacksmith&rsquo;s regret at having thus unwittingly revived
      the memory of this circumstance,&mdash;more painful, alas! for Mother
      Bunch than Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her
      infirmity had been the cause of that quarrel. Notwithstanding his strength
      and resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how
      painful that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his
      eyes, and, holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, &ldquo;Forgive
      my heedlessness! Come, kiss me.&rdquo; And he gave her thin, pale cheeks
      two hearty kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl&rsquo;s lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her
      heart beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you forgive me, do you not?&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; she said, trying to subdue her emotion; &ldquo;but
      the recollection of that quarrel pains me&mdash;I was so alarmed on your
      account; if the crowd had sided with that man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl&rsquo;s
      relief, without knowing it, &ldquo;I was never so afraid in all my life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; rejoined Agricola, trying to change a
      conversation which had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, &ldquo;for
      the wife of a horse grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much
      courage. Oh, my brave father; I can&rsquo;t believe he is really coming!
      The very thought turns me topsy-turvy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven grant he may come,&rdquo; said Frances, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it, mother. He will grant it, I should think. Lord knows,
      you have had masses enough said for his return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, my child,&rdquo; said Frances, interrupting her son, and
      shaking her head sadly, &ldquo;do not speak in that way. Besides, you are
      talking of your father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m in for it this evening. &lsquo;Tis your turn now;
      positively, I am growing stupid, or going crazy. Forgive me, mother!
      forgive! That&rsquo;s the only word I can get out to-night. You know that,
      when I do let out on certain subjects, it is because I can&rsquo;t help
      it; for I know well the pain it gives you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to
      offend one&rsquo;s mother; and, with respect to what I said about father&rsquo;s
      return, I do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have not heard from him for four months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, mother, in his letter&mdash;that is, in the letter which
      he dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
      told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
      in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
      expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
      three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
      might go and meet him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater reason why we should wait patiently. But I&rsquo;ll
      tell you more: I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come
      back about the same time. His last letter from America makes me hope so.
      What pleasure, mother, should all the family be together!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my child! It would be a happy day for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that day will soon come, trust me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember your father, Agricola?&rdquo; inquired Mother
      Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier&rsquo;s
      shako and moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the
      red ribbon of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and
      the shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother? But
      what is the matter? You are weeping!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! poor Baudoin! What he must suffer at being separated from us
      at his age&mdash;sixty and past! Alas! my child, my heart breaks, when I
      think that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I earn nothing now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s become of me? Isn&rsquo;t there a room here for
      you and for him; and a table for you too? Only, my good mother, since we
      are talking of domestic affairs,&rdquo; added the blacksmith, imparting
      increased tenderness to his tone, that he might not shock his mother,
      &ldquo;when he and Gabriel come home, you won&rsquo;t want to have any
      more masses said, and tapers burned for them, will you? Well, that saving
      will enable father to have tobacco to smoke, and his bottle of wine every
      day. Then, on Sundays, we will take a nice dinner at the eating-house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A knocking at the door disturbed Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said he. Instead of doing so, some one half-opened
      the door, and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
      blacksmith.

    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers,&rdquo; said Agricola;
      &ldquo;come in, Daddy, no ceremony.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I
      should cover missus&rsquo;s floor with green.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. It will remind me of the fields I like so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the spy, eh? Oh, be easy; what&rsquo;s he to us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I think he&rsquo;s gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can&rsquo;t
      see him. But that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;come, come quickly! It is very
      important,&rdquo; said the dyer, with a mysterious look; &ldquo;and only
      concerns you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, only?&rdquo; said Agricola, with surprise. &ldquo;What can it
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see, my child,&rdquo; said Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.

      CHAPTER XXX. THE RETURN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n five minutes
      Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated&mdash;his eyes glistened
      with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance expressed
      extraordinary happiness and emotion. He stood at the door for a moment, as
      if too much affected to accost his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances&rsquo;s sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
      change her son&rsquo;s countenance had undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my child&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more discernment,
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Goodness, Agricola&mdash;how pale you are! Whatever is
      the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without
      replying to the sempstress,&mdash;&ldquo;mother, expect news that will
      astonish you; but promise me you will be calm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? How you tremble! Look at me! Mother Bunch was
      right&mdash;you are quite pale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My kind mother!&rdquo; and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took
      both her hands in his&mdash;&ldquo;you must&mdash;you do not know,&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith could not go on. Tears of joy interrupted his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weep, my dear child! Your tears alarm me. &lsquo;What is the
      matter?&mdash;you terrify me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary,&rdquo; said
      Agricola, drying his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;you will be so happy. But, again,
      you must try and command your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as
      too much grief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not say true, when I said he would come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Frances. She rose from her seat; but her
      surprise and emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to
      still its beating, and then she felt her strength fail. Her son sustained
      her, and assisted her to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
      distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother. But
      she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
      changed color more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, courage, mother,&rdquo; said the blacksmith; &ldquo;now the
      shock is over, you have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor man! after eighteen years&rsquo; absence. Oh, I cannot
      believe it,&rdquo; said Frances, bursting into tears. &ldquo;Is it true?
      Is it, indeed, true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I
      will tell you when you may see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon&mdash;may I not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when will he arrive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may arrive any minute&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;perhaps to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother! Well, I must tell you all&mdash;he has arrived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he is&mdash;&rdquo; Frances could not articulate the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was downstairs just now. Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
      apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
      surprise might hurt you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable
      joy&mdash;&ldquo;he is there, waiting! Oh, mother! for the last ten
      minutes I have scarcely been able to contain myself&mdash;my heart is
      bursting with joy.&rdquo; And running to the door, he threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.
      Instead of rushing to her husband&rsquo;s arms, Frances fell on her knees
      in prayer. She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
      prayers, and thus accepting her offerings. During a second, the actors of
      this scene stood silent and motionless. Agricola, by a sentiment of
      respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
      not dare to fall on his father&rsquo;s neck. He waited with constrained
      impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
      understood each other. The first glance exchanged by father and son
      expressed their affection&mdash;their veneration for that excellent woman,
      who in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
      creature for the Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
      kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
      the thought of Agricola&rsquo;s happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
      corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
      of place in that family meeting. Frances rose, and took a step towards her
      husband, who received her in his arms. There was a moment of solemn
      silence. Dagobert and Frances said not a word. Nothing could be heard but
      a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy. And, when the aged couple looked
      up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
      enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish and
      violent agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said the soldier, in tones of emotion,
      presenting the orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had
      surveyed them with astonishment, &ldquo;this is my good and worthy wife;
      she will be to the daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madame, you will treat us as your children,&rdquo; said Rose,
      approaching Frances with her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughters of General Simon!&rdquo; cried Dagobert&rsquo;s wife,
      more and more astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without
      some difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little things! One would take them for two angels, exactly
      alike!&rdquo; said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much
      interest as admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;for us,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, turning to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; rejoined the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and his
      son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted only
      to look in Agricola&rsquo;s face; while he rested his hands on the young
      blacksmith&rsquo;s broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
      frank masculine countenance, and robust frame. Then he shook his hand
      again, exclaiming, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine fellow&mdash;well built&mdash;what
      a good-hearted look he has!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola&rsquo;s happiness;
      but she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an
      intrusion. She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so. Dagobert
      and his son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take
      her eyes from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche. She had never seen
      anything so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters
      increased her surprise. Then, their humble mourning revealing that they
      were poor, Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear children! They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
      unfortunately, the fire is out,&rdquo; said Frances, She tried to warm the
      orphans&rsquo; hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves
      up to the feelings of affection, so long restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
      make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
      cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
      pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
      embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw and
      blaze. Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
      presuming that the orphans required some warm drink. The sempstress did
      all this with so much dexterity and so little noise&mdash;she was
      naturally so forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene&mdash;that
      Frances, entirely occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire
      when she felt its warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water
      singing in the coffee-pot. This phenomenon&mdash;fire rekindling of itself&mdash;did
      not astonish Dagobert&rsquo;s wife then, so wholly was she taken up in
      devising how she could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen,
      had not given her notice of their arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! there&rsquo;s Spoil-sport,&rdquo; said Dagobert, letting in
      his dog; &ldquo;he wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family
      too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home. After
      having rubbed Dagobert&rsquo;s hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to
      greet Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that
      they took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
      apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
      saying, &ldquo;the friends of our friends are our friends,&rdquo; he went
      and licked the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten
      by all. By a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she
      patted her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the
      intelligent dog. Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she
      had done all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the
      handsome flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went
      away so discreetly that no one noticed her departure. After this exchange
      of mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
      realities of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Frances,&rdquo; said the soldier, glancing at Rose and
      Blanche, &ldquo;you did not expect such a pretty surprise!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only sorry, my friend,&rdquo; replied Frances, &ldquo;that the
      daughters of General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor
      room; for with Agricola&rsquo;s garret&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It composes our mansion,&rdquo; interrupted Dagobert; &ldquo;there
      are handsomer, it must be confessed. But be at ease; these young ladies
      are drilled into not being hard to suit on that score. To-morrow, I and my
      boy will go arm and arm, and I&rsquo;ll answer for it he won&rsquo;t walk
      the more upright and straight of the two, and find out General Simon&rsquo;s
      father, at M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory, to talk about business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Agricola to Dagobert, &ldquo;you will not
      find at the factory either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you say, my lad?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, hastily,
      &ldquo;the Marshal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure; since 1830, General Simon&rsquo;s friends have secured
      him the title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, with emotion, &ldquo;but that ought
      not to surprise me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said
      a thing, the least they can do is to let it abide. But it goes all the
      same to my heart; it makes me jump again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing the sisters, he said: &ldquo;Do you hear that, my children? You
      arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France. One would
      hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
      duchesses! But patience; all will go well. Ah, father Simon must have been
      very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank! eh, my lad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see
      his son again; for it was during the general&rsquo;s absence that his
      friends obtained this act of justice. But they expect Marshal Simon every
      moment, for the last letter from India announced his departure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
      filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised! These children rely on his return; but why shall
      we not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill
      established in the south; but we expect them back every day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! that&rsquo;s vexing; I relied on seeing the general&rsquo;s
      father, to talk over some important matters with him. At any rate, they
      know where to write to him. So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad,
      that his granddaughters are arrived. In the mean time, children,&rdquo;
      added the soldier, to Rose and Blanche, &ldquo;my good wife will give you
      her bed and you must put up with the chances of war. Poor things! they
      will not be worse off here than they were on the journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we shall always be well off with you and madame,&rdquo;
      said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
      since here we are to find our father,&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hope gives you patience, I know,&rdquo; said Dagobert, &ldquo;but
      no matter! After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely
      surprised, my children. As yet, you have not found it the golden city of
      your dreams, by any means. But, patience, patience; you&rsquo;ll find
      Paris not so bad as it looks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;I am sure the arrival of
      Marshal Simon in Paris will change it for you into a golden city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Agricola,&rdquo; said Rose, with a smile, &ldquo;you
      have, indeed, guessed us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you know my name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
      latterly, too, with Gabriel,&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the
      orphans, &ldquo;we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and
      among other things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel. All I can now say
      is that, in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired
      of saying &lsquo;my boy&rsquo;); and they ought to love each other like
      brothers. Oh, my brave, brave wife!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with emotion,
      &ldquo;you did a good thing, poor as you were, taking the unfortunate
      child&mdash;and bringing him up with your own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple
      thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; but I&rsquo;ll make you amends for it by and by.
      &lsquo;Tis down to your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see
      him to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear brother arrived too!&rdquo; cried the blacksmith; &ldquo;who&rsquo;ll
      say, after this, that there are not days set apart for happiness? How came
      you to meet him, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met
      Gabriel; for if you expect to sleep, you are mistaken. You&rsquo;ll give
      me half your room, and a fine chat we&rsquo;ll have. Spoil-sport will stay
      outside of this door; he is accustomed to sleep at the children&rsquo;s
      door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, love, I think of nothing. But, at such a moment, if you
      and the young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
      cook-shop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to
      warm you a little, my dear young ladies,&rdquo; said Frances; &ldquo;unfortunately,
      I have nothing else to offer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go
      to bed; while they do so, I&rsquo;ll go to my boy&rsquo;s room, and,
      before Rose and Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you,
      just to give Agricola a respite.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      A knock was now heard at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her,&rdquo; said
      Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think she was here when my husband came in,&rdquo; added
      Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an
      intruder: she is so thoughtful. But no&mdash;no&mdash;it is not she who
      knocks so loud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see who it is, then, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with a
      respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking for
      a moment at Rose and Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to observe, sir,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;that after
      knocking, you might have waited till the door was opened, before you
      entered. Pray, what is your business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said the man, very politely, and
      speaking slowly, perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: &ldquo;I beg a
      thousand pardons&mdash;I regret my intrusion&mdash;I am ashamed&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ought to be, sir,&rdquo; said Agricola, with impatience,
      &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; upstairs,&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; cried the polite man, with low bows, &ldquo;I
      am quite abroad at my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young
      person. I brought her proposals for work from a very respectable party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very late, sir,&rdquo; said Agricola, with surprise. &ldquo;But
      that young person is as one of our family. Call to-morrow; you cannot see
      her to night; she is gone to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, sir,&rdquo; said Agricola, taking a step towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
      assured that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to
      excuse the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
      his moustache with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wit the boy has!&rdquo; said he aside to his wife. &ldquo;But
      that does not astonish you&mdash;you are used to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again directed
      a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground for
      herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans, assisted
      them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola having
      previously withdrawn to their garret. Just as the blacksmith, who preceded
      his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother Bunch&rsquo;s
      room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him rapidly, in a
      low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did not
      hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old soldier
      said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boy, what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, father,&rdquo; said the blacksmith, turning round; &ldquo;I
      feared I did not light you well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen
      to night;&rdquo; and the soldier, not noticing his son&rsquo;s surprise,
      went into the little room where they were both to pass the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
      polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street. He advanced
      towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he, in an inquiring tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to
      Frances Baudoin&rsquo;s; by listening at the door, I learnt that the
      sisters will sleep with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray
      moustache will share the young blacksmith&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening
      on the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
      learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
      post about the young blacksmith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fail! And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin&rsquo;s
      confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
      Rue du Milieu des Ursins&mdash;he must not lose a moment. Do you come with
      him. Should I not be returned, he will wait for me. You will tell him it
      is on a matter of great moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All shall be faithfully executed,&rdquo; said the ceremonious man,
      cringing to Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.

      CHAPTER XXXI. AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ithin one hour
      after the different scenes which have just been described the most
      profound silence reigned in the soldier&rsquo;s humble dwelling. A
      flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
      betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
      recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
      by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
      the roof. A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so nearly
      filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be seated
      within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
      was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
      linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
      calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
      feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle. The sempstress, who
      had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed&mdash;her
      looks were downcast, and her eyes full of tears. She supported herself
      with one hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door,
      listened with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the
      footsteps of Agricola. The heart of the young sempstress beat violently;
      her face, usually very pale, was now partially flushed&mdash;so exciting
      was the emotion by which she was agitated. Sometimes she cast her eyes
      with terror upon a letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had
      been delivered by post in the course of the evening, and which had been
      placed by the housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was
      rendering some trivial domestic services during the recognitions of
      Dagobert and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is at last!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and Agricola immediately
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited till my father went to sleep,&rdquo; said the blacksmith,
      in a low voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than
      uneasiness. &ldquo;But what is the matter, my good sister? How your
      countenance is changed! You weep! What has happened? About what danger
      would you speak to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Read this!&rdquo; said she, her voice trembling with emotion,
      while she hastily presented to him the open letter. Agricola held it
      towards the light, and read what follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
      sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.
      That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air
      of stupefied amazement. &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read on!&rdquo; quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his eyes:-&ldquo;The
      song, entitled &lsquo;Working-men Freed,&rsquo; has been declared
      libellous. Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
      secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
      being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the girl, melting into tears, &ldquo;now I see it
      all. The man who was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed
      by the dyer, was, doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola. &ldquo;This accusation is
      quite ridiculous! Do not torment yourself. I never trouble myself with
      politics. My verses breathe nothing but philanthropy. Am I to blame, if
      they have been found among the papers of a secret society?&rdquo; Agricola
      disdainfully threw the letter upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read! pray read!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;read on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;I will; no time is
      lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed the reading of the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin. There is
      mo doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
      well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
      order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
      trial&mdash;an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
      whose sole support he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his
      countenance resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: &ldquo;Reassure
      yourself, good Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying
      their games on me. It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me
      before the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, for the love of heaven!&rdquo; said the girl, in a
      supplicating tone; &ldquo;treat not the warning thus lightly. Believe in
      my forebodings, and listen to my advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you again, my good girl,&rdquo; replied Agricola, &ldquo;that
      it is two months since my song was published. It is not in any way
      political; indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before
      coming down on me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you forget that new events have
      arisen. It is scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in
      this very neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires. And,&rdquo; continued
      she, &ldquo;if the verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now
      been found in the possession of the persons apprehended for this
      conspiracy, nothing more is necessary to compromise you in the plot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromise me!&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;my verses! in which I
      only praise the love of labor and of goodness! To arrest me for that! If
      so, justice would be but a blind noodle. That she might grope her way, it
      would be necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim&rsquo;s staff
      to guide her steps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola,&rdquo; resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and
      terror on hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, &ldquo;I conjure
      you to listen to me! No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of
      labor; but you do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of
      the poor laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries
      of life; you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good
      and noble heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the
      selfish and the wicked. In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor
      of your wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate
      than you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer. Say, Agricola, in these
      times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
      that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
      persons who have been apprehended?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
      excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view with
      more seriousness the advice which she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say:
      &ldquo;And then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remi!&rdquo; said Agricola, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed the sempstress; &ldquo;a letter of his, a
      letter in itself quite insignificant, was found in the house of a person
      arrested last year for conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a
      month in prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily
      shown, and he was set at liberty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that
      has furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal
      yourself! A month in prison! Good heavens! Agricola, think of that! and
      your mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola. He took up the
      letter and again read it attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?&rdquo;
      proceeded she. &ldquo;I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot
      be naturally accounted for. Alas! what a blow it would be for your father,
      and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything. Are you not now
      their only resource? Oh! consider, then, what would become of them without
      you&mdash;without your labor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would indeed be terrible,&rdquo; said Agricola, impatiently
      casting the letter upon the table. &ldquo;What you have said concerning
      Remi is too true. He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an
      involuntary error though it be, is not the less cruel. But they don&rsquo;t
      commit a man without hearing him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards,&rdquo; said
      Mother Bunch, bitterly; &ldquo;and then, after a month or two, they
      restore him his liberty. And if he have a wife and children, whose only
      means of living is his daily labor, what becomes of them while their only
      supporter is in prison? They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they
      weep!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month without work,&rdquo; he said, with a sad and thoughtful
      air. &ldquo;And my mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make
      part of our family until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal
      Simon. Oh! you are right. That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl impetuously; &ldquo;suppose you
      apply to M. Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed
      and honored, that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up
      their persecution?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; replied Agricola, &ldquo;M. Hardy is absent;
      he is on a journey with Marshal Simon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
      added: &ldquo;But no! I cannot give credence to this letter. After all, I
      had rather await what may come. I&rsquo;ll at least have the chance of
      proving my innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister,
      whether it be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my
      working for my family will be equally prevented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that is true,&rdquo; said the poor girl; &ldquo;what is to be
      done! Oh, what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brave father,&rdquo; said Agricola to himself, &ldquo;if this
      misfortune happen to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who
      came here to sleep so joyously!&rdquo; The blacksmith buried his face in
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily Mother Bunch&rsquo;s fears were too well-founded, for it will be
      recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
      des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
      among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
      democratical ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
      seconds. A blush colored her features, which bore the impressions of an
      indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, you are saved!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower&rdquo;
      (she showed it to the blacksmith) &ldquo;who has known how to make
      reparation with so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot
      but have a generous heart. You must apply to her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
      over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks. For the first time in
      her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy. Another woman was
      so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
      idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola surprised. &ldquo;But
      what could be done with this young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she not say to you,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch, &ldquo;&lsquo;Remember
      my name; and in all circumstances address yourself to me?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did indeed!&rdquo; replied Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
      connections who will be able to protect and defend you. Go to her to
      morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
      support.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen. I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he
      had saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety
      for him. It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
      innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
      will have nothing more to fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child!&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;to ask so great a
      service from a person to whom one is almost unknown is hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Agricola,&rdquo; said the other sadly, &ldquo;I would
      never counsel what could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and
      above all&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;above all, in the eyes of this
      young lady. I do not propose that you should ask money from her; but only
      that she should give surety for you, in order that you may have the
      liberty of continuing at your employment, so that the family may not be
      without resources. Believe me, Agricola, that such a request is in no
      respect inconsistent with what is noble and becoming upon your part. The
      heart of the young lady is generous. She will comprehend your position.
      The required surety will be as nothing to her; while to you it will be
      everything, and will even be the very life to those who depend upon you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my good sister,&rdquo; said Agricola, with sadness
      and dejection. &ldquo;It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.
      If the young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety
      will indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.
      But no, no!&rdquo; added he, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never dare to make
      the request to her! What right have I to do so? What is the insignificant
      service that I rendered her, when compared with that which I should
      solicit from her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
      services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received? Trust
      to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart. I am, it is
      true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any other
      person. I am nothing, and I can do nothing. Nevertheless, I am sure&mdash;yes,
      Agricola, I am sure&mdash;that this young lady, who is so very far above
      me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair; yes, like
      me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel one; and she
      will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that which I would
      do, if, alas! I could do anything more than uselessly consume myself with
      regrets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
      heart-breaking&mdash;there was something so moving in the comparison which
      this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
      made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
      youth, beauty, and opulence&mdash;that Agricola was moved even to tears;
      and, holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her,
      tenderly, &ldquo;How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good
      feeling, and delicacy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappily,&rdquo; said the weeping girl, &ldquo;I can do nothing
      more than advise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear. They are
      those of a soul the most elevated I have ever known. Yes, you have won me
      over into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss
      de Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne, the
      sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely sweet
      and consoling were her emotions. If some poor creatures, fatally devoted
      to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught, they
      sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the world
      is equally ignorant. The least word of true tenderness and affection,
      which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably blissful for
      these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to hardships and
      to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
      lady&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a
      new-born hope. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she quickly added, &ldquo;at break of
      day I&rsquo;ll go down to watch at the street-door, to see if there be
      anything suspicious, and to apprise you of what I perceive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, excellent girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola, with increasing
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of
      your father,&rdquo; said the hunchback. &ldquo;The quarter in which the
      young lady dwells, is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost
      serve for your present concealment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I hear the voice of my father,&rdquo; said Agricola
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola&rsquo;s garret, that
      he and the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy? Why, my first sleep is
      over; and my tongue itches deucedly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quick, Agricola!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch; &ldquo;your absence
      would disquiet him. On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I
      inform you whether or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Agricola, you are not here?&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, in a
      louder voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, father,&rdquo; said the smith, while going out of the
      sempstress&rsquo;s apartment, and entering the garret, to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated,
      lest its noise should disturb you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, gayly; &ldquo;it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with
      you. Oh, my dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father,
      who has not seen his son for eighteen years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I light a candle, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark. It will
      be a new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak. It will
      be like seeing you for the first time twice.&rdquo; The door of Agricola&rsquo;s
      garret being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
      not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
      order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola. However, in spite
      of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
      sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy. She compared the
      conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
      she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
      possessed some share of charms and beauty&mdash;had she been loved as she
      loved, with a chaste and devoted flame! But soon sinking into belief that
      she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
      consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola. At the dawn of day,
      she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
      to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE AWAKENING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he weather, damp
      and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear and cold towards
      morning. Through the glazed skylight of Agricola&rsquo;s garret, where he
      lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
      sewing-girl&rsquo;s. For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
      Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a nail
      in the wall a portrait of Beranger&mdash;that immortal poet whom the
      people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
      delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
      reverses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had already
      risen. The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his inquietude,
      for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number of
      precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of Agricola&rsquo;s
      song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the disconcerted plot,
      was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the young blacksmith. His
      father, however, as we have already mentioned, suspected not his secret
      anguish. Seated by the side of his son, upon the edge of their mean little
      bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had dressed and shaved with
      military care; he now held between his hands both those of Agricola, his
      countenance radiant with joy, and unable to discontinue the contemplation
      of his boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will laugh at me, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Dagobert to his son;
      &ldquo;but I wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze
      upon you in full day, as I now see you. But all in good time; I have lost
      nothing. Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
      moustaches. What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made! Tell me;
      have you never had a wish to be a soldier?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Dagobert: &ldquo;and besides, I
      believe, after all, look ye, that the time of the sword has gone by. We
      old fellows are now good for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the
      chimney. Like rusty old carbines, we have had our day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; your days of heroism and of glory,&rdquo; said Agricola with
      excitement; and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and
      agitated, &ldquo;it is something good and cheering to be your son!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the good, I know nothing of that,&rdquo; replied Dagobert;
      &ldquo;but as for the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.
      And I think this is but the beginning! What say you, Agricola? I am like
      the famished wretches who have been some days without food. It is but by
      little and little that they recover themselves, and can eat. Now, you may
      expect to be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the
      day. No, I wish not to think that&mdash;not all the day&mdash;no, that
      thought dazzles and perplexes me; and I am no longer myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola. He believed
      that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
      menaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Dagobert; &ldquo;you are quite happy; M.
      Hardy is always good to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Agricola: &ldquo;there is none in the world
      better, or more equitable and generous! If you knew what wonders he has
      brought about in his factory! Compared to all others, it is a paradise
      beside the stithies of Lucifer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see,&rdquo; resumed Agricola, &ldquo;what welfare, what
      joy, what affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he
      employs; who work with an ardent pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, father, a very great magician. He has known how to render
      labor pleasant and attractive. As for the pleasure, over and above good
      wages, he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
      whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work. And that
      is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
      which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
      and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
      association. But you shall see&mdash;I repeat&mdash;you shall see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,&rdquo;
      observed Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor
      good mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father, we will never separate again,&rdquo; said Agricola,
      stifling a sigh. &ldquo;My mother and I will both try to make you forget
      all that you have suffered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffered!&rdquo; exclaimed Dagobert, &ldquo;who the deuce has
      suffered? Look me well in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!
      Bombs and bayonets! Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a
      young man again! You shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!
      You must rig yourself up something extra! Lord, how they will stare at us!
      I wager that in beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will
      say, behold father and son! But let us settle what we are to do with the
      day. You will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
      grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
      hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
      are of great importance for them. While you are writing, I will go down to
      say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones. We will then eat
      a morsel. Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes to be
      regular at that: the good soul! no great harm, if it amuse her! and during
      her absence, we will make a raid together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Agricola, with embarrassment, &ldquo;this
      morning it is out of my power to accompany you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! out of your power?&rdquo; said Dagobert; &ldquo;recollect this
      is Monday!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Agricola, hesitatingly; &ldquo;but I have
      promised to attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that
      is required in a hurry. If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury
      upon M. Hardy. But I&rsquo;ll soon be at liberty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alters the case,&rdquo; said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret.
      &ldquo;I thought to make my first parade through Paris with you this
      morning; but it must be deferred in favor of your work. It is sacred:
      since it is that which sustains your mother. Nevertheless, it is
      vexatious, devilish vexatious. And yet no&mdash;I am unjust. See how
      quickly one gets habituated to and spoilt by happiness. I growl like a
      true grumbler, at a walk being put off for a few hours! I do this! I who,
      during eighteen years, have only hoped to see you once more, without
      daring to reckon very much upon it! Oh! I am but a silly old fool! Vive l&rsquo;amour
      et cogni&mdash;I mean&mdash;my Agricola!&rdquo; And, to console himself,
      the old soldier gayly slapped his son&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
      moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized.
      &ldquo;Now that I have recovered myself,&rdquo; said Dagobert, laughing,
      &ldquo;let us speak of business. Know you where I find the addresses of
      all the notaries in Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason is,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, &ldquo;that I sent from
      Russia by post, and by order of the mother of the two children that I have
      brought here, some important papers to a Parisian notary. As it was my
      duty to see this notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his
      name and his address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed
      during my journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems
      to me, that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might
      recollect it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start. He involuntarily
      thought of a warrant for his apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
      not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
      The door opened. It was Gabriel. He wore a black cassock and a broad
      brimmed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
      were two movements performed at once by Agricola&mdash;as quick as
      thought.&mdash;&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola!&rdquo; cried Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; responded the blacksmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After so long an absence!&rdquo; said the one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To behold you again!&rdquo; rejoined the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
      while they were locked in a close embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
      become moist. There was something truly touching in the affection of the
      young men&mdash;in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
      aspects so very different&mdash;for the manly countenance of Agricola
      contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was forewarned by my father of your arrival,&rdquo; said the
      blacksmith at length. &ldquo;I have been expecting to see you; and my
      happiness has been a hundred times the greater, because I have had all the
      pleasures of hoping for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my good mother?&rdquo; asked Gabriel, in affectionately
      grasping the hands of Dagobert. &ldquo;I trust that you have found her in
      good health.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my brave boy!&rdquo; replied Dagobert; &ldquo;and her health
      will have become a hundred times better, now that we are all together.
      Nothing is so healthful as joy.&rdquo; Then addressing himself to
      Agricola, who, forgetting his fear of being arrested, regarded the
      missionary with an expression of ineffable affection, Dagobert added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl,
      Gabriel has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what
      intrepidity he saved the lives of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters, and
      tried to save mine also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Gabriel! what has happened to your forehead?&rdquo; suddenly
      exclaimed Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining
      the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly beneath
      the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through which shone
      upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which extended from
      one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
      events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
      Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
      Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the young
      missionary. Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son, Dagobert
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, indeed! how came this scar upon your brow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on his hands, too; see, dear father!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      blacksmith, with renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which
      the young priest held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!&rdquo; added Dagobert;
      &ldquo;who has wounded you thus?&rdquo; and in his turn, taking the other
      hand of the missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a
      judge of wounds, and then added, &ldquo;In Spain, one of my comrades was
      found and taken down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of
      several roads, upon which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of
      hunger, thirst, and agony. Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands,
      exactly similar to this upon your hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is right!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola. &ldquo;It is evident
      that your hands have been pierced through! My poor brother!&rdquo; and
      Agricola became grievously agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think about it,&rdquo; said Gabriel, reddening with the
      embarrassment of modesty. &ldquo;Having gone as a missionary amongst the
      savages of the Rocky Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to
      scalp me, when Providence snatched me from their hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate youth,&rdquo; said Dagobert; &ldquo;without arms then?
      You had not a sufficient escort for your protection?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/10305.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for such as me to carry arms.&rdquo; said Gabriel,
      sweetly smiling; &ldquo;and we are never accompanied by any escort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came
      it that they did not defend you?&rdquo; impetuously asked Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was alone, my dear brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, alone; without even a guide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alone! unarmed! in a barbarous country!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Dagobert, scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting
      his own sense of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was sublime!&rdquo; said the young blacksmith and poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Christian faith,&rdquo; said Gabriel, with mild simplicity,
      &ldquo;cannot be implanted by force or violence. It is only by the power
      of persuasion that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when persuasions fail!&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is
      in him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
      blessings it offers to mankind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
      was uttered with simple and touching pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
      thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
      contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
      and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
      unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his two
      friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, &ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails me!&rdquo; exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great
      emotion: &ldquo;After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had
      imagined myself to be about as courageous as any man. And now I find I
      have a master! And that master is yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said Gabriel; &ldquo;what do you mean? What have I done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder, don&rsquo;t you know that the brave wounds there&rdquo;
      (the veteran took with transport both of Gabriel&rsquo;s hands), &ldquo;that
      these wounds are as glorious&mdash;are more glorious than our&mdash;than
      all ours, as warriors by profession!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes, my father speaks truth!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola; and he
      added, with enthusiasm, &ldquo;Oh, for such priests! How I love them! How
      I venerate them! How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
      resignation!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you not to extol me thus,&rdquo; said Gabriel with
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not extol you!&rdquo; replied Dagobert. &ldquo;Hanged if I shouldn&rsquo;t.
      When I have gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone? Was I
      not under the eyes of my commanding officer? Were not my comrades there
      along with me? In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
      preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the shouts
      and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes of the
      trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse, which
      bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail? Need I state that I
      also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every one&mdash;the
      emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough hide, would
      give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound. Thanks to all
      these causes, I passed for game. Fair enough! But are you not a thousand
      times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone, unarmed, to confront
      enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those whom we attacked&mdash;we,
      who fought in whole squadrons, supported by artillery, bomb-shells, and
      case-shot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent father!&rdquo; cried Agricola, &ldquo;how noble of you to
      render to Gabriel this justice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear brother,&rdquo; said Gabriel, &ldquo;his kindness to me
      makes him magnify what was quite natural and simple!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural!&rdquo; said the veteran soldier; &ldquo;yes, natural for
      gallants who have hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, very rare,&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;for that kind of
      courage is the most admirable of all. Most bravely did you seek almost
      certain death, alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to
      preach charity and Christian brotherhood. They seized you, tortured you;
      and you await death and partly endure it, without complaint, without
      remonstrance, without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance;
      forgiveness issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your
      lips; and this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
      magnanimity,&mdash;none could behold you&mdash;and without other desire,
      after you were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your
      black robe! My father is right, by Jove! can you still contend that you
      are not as brave as he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides, too,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, &ldquo;the dear boy did
      all that for a thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his
      wounds will never change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich
      robe of a bishop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be,&rdquo; said Gabriel
      to Dagobert, smiling meekly. &ldquo;If I am deemed worthy, a great
      recompense awaits me on high.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to all that, my boy,&rdquo; said Dagobert, &ldquo;I do not
      understand it; and I will not argue about it. I maintain it, that my old
      cross of honor would be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as
      upon my uniform.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
      Gabriel,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;and if you did know, dear father,
      how much virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the
      priesthood insolently call the inferior clergy,&mdash;the unseen merit and
      the blind devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country
      curates, who are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by
      the lordly lawnsleeves! Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in
      their vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
      enfranchisement! Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
      are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us. Do I say right,
      Gabriel? You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
      ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
      understand the good that you could work within it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My desire is still the same,&rdquo; said Gabriel sadly: &ldquo;but
      unfortunately&mdash;&rdquo; and then, as if he wished to escape from a
      painful thought, and to change the conversation, he, addressing himself to
      Dagobert, added: &ldquo;Believe me: be more just than to undervalue your
      own courage by exalting mine. Your courage must be very great&mdash;very
      great; for, after a battle, the spectacle of the carnage must be truly
      terrible to a generous and feeling heart. We, at least, though we may be
      killed, do not kill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
      looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, &ldquo;This is most
      surprising!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; inquired Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Gabriel has just told us,&rdquo; replied Dagobert, &ldquo;brings
      to my mind what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion
      as I advanced in years. Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
      after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,&mdash;alone,&mdash;by
      night,&mdash;amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in
      our possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand
      of the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
      my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
      restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
      whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
      &lsquo;for what have these men been killed?&mdash;FOR WHAT&mdash;FOR WHAT?&rsquo;
      But this feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the
      following morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from
      rushing once more to the slaughter. But the same thought always recurred
      when my arm became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the
      mane of my horse, I have said to myself, &lsquo;I have killed!&mdash;killed!!&mdash;killed!!!
      and, FOR WHAT!!!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
      soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Gabriel to him, &ldquo;all generous hearts feel
      as you did during the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has
      subsided, and man is left alone to the influence of the good instincts
      planted in his bosom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that should prove, my brave boy,&rdquo; rejoined Dagobert,
      &ldquo;that you are greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as
      you call them, have never abandoned you. * * * * But how the deuce did you
      escape from the claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
      that the soldier said to him: &ldquo;If you ought not or cannot answer my
      request, let us say no more about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother,&rdquo;
      replied the missionary with altered voice. &ldquo;Only; it will be
      difficult for me to make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked Agricola with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, &ldquo;I must
      have been deceived by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted
      moment in which I awaited death with resignation. My enfeebled mind, in
      spite of me, must have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the
      present hour has remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly
      developed; and I should have known with greater certainty that it was the
      strange woman&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
      also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had freed
      him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what woman do you speak?&rdquo; asked Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of her who saved me,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?&rdquo; said
      Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections,
      &ldquo;a woman, young and beautiful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was this woman?&rdquo; asked Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not. When I asked her, she replied, &lsquo;I am the sister
      of the distressed!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whence came she? Whither went she?&rdquo; asked Dagobert,
      singularly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I go wheresoever there is suffering,&rsquo; she replied,&rdquo;
      answered the missionary; &ldquo;and she departed, going towards the north
      of America&mdash;towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal
      snow, where the nights are without end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As in Siberia,&rdquo; said Dagobert, who had become very
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who
      seemed also to have become more and more absorbed, &ldquo;in what manner
      or by what means did this woman come to your assistance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
      heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
      fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
      brother. &ldquo;Agricola,&rdquo; said a sweet voice outside the door,
      &ldquo;I wish to speak with you as soon as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch&rsquo;s voice, and opened the door.
      But the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
      passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: &ldquo;Agricola, it is an hour
      since broad day, and you have not yet departed! How imprudent! I have been
      watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing alarming;
      but they may come any instant to arrest you. Hasten, I conjure you, your
      departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville. Not a minute should be
      lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been
      gone. But I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time
      with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel here!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for,
      as has been stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Agricola, &ldquo;for half an hour he has been
      with my father and me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happiness I shall have in seeing him again,&rdquo; said the
      sewing-girl. &ldquo;He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a
      brief space to your mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on
      account of the young ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they
      still sleep. Your mother has requested me to give you this letter for your
      father. She has just received it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Mother Bunch, &ldquo;now that you have seen
      Gabriel, do not delay long. Think what a blow it would be for your father,
      if they came to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;it is indispensable
      that I should depart&mdash;while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my
      fears were forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this
      favor, perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as
      to yourself and us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! a very few minutes more; and I&rsquo;ll come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I return to watch at the door. If I perceive anything. I&rsquo;ll
      come up again to apprise you. But pray, do not delay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy, good sister.&rdquo; Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the
      staircase, to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered
      his garret. &ldquo;Dear father,&rdquo; he said to Dagobert, &ldquo;my
      mother has just received this letter, and she requests you to read it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; read it for me, my boy.&rdquo; And Agricola read as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MADAME.&mdash;I understand that your husband has been charged by
      General Simon with an affair of very great importance. Will you, as soon
      as your husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at
      Chartres without a moment&rsquo;s delay. I am instructed to deliver to
      himself, and to no other person, some documents indispensable to the
      interests of General Simon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;DURAND, Notary at Chartres.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, &ldquo;Who
      can have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, father,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;this is the notary to
      whom you transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his
      address was Paris, not Chartres. And, besides,&rdquo; said the soldier,
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;if he has some important documents, why didn&rsquo;t
      he transmit them to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon
      as possible,&rdquo; said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this
      circumstance would withdraw his father for about two days, during which
      time his (Agricola&rsquo;s) fate would be decided in one way or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your counsel is good,&rdquo; replied his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thwarts your intentions in some degree?&rdquo; asked Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.
      However, &lsquo;duty before everything.&rsquo; Having come happily from
      Siberia to Paris, it is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to
      Chartres, when it is required on an affair of importance. In twice
      twenty-four hours I shall be back again. But the deuce take me if I
      expected to leave Paris for Chartres to-day. Luckily, I leave Rose and
      Blanche with my good wife; and Gabriel, their angel, as they call him,
      will be here to keep them company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, unfortunately, impossible,&rdquo; said the missionary,
      sadly. &ldquo;This visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A farewell visit! Now!&rdquo; exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, yes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You start already on another mission?&rdquo; said Dagobert; &ldquo;surely
      it is not possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must answer no question upon this subject,&rdquo; said Gabriel,
      suppressing a sigh: &ldquo;but from now, for some time, I cannot, and
      ought not, come again into this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my brave boy,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert with emotion, &ldquo;there
      is something in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression. I
      know something of men. He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments
      after the shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry
      to see you enrolled under such a commander.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Cardoville Castle!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola, struck with the
      identity of the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair;
      &ldquo;was it in Cardoville Castle that you were received after your
      shipwreck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?&rdquo; asked Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the
      time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to
      return thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me
      that the person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a singular coincidence,&rdquo; thought Agricola, &ldquo;if the
      young lady should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
      to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; &ldquo;Dear father, excuse me; but
      it is already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is too true, my boy. Let us go. This party is adjourned till
      my return from Chartres. Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
      latter had continued pensive. At the moment when Agricola approached him
      to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him solemnly,
      with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished both the
      blacksmith and the soldier: &ldquo;My dear brother, one word more. I have
      come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall have
      need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),&rdquo;
      added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! you speak thus to us!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola; &ldquo;what
      is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, &ldquo;I need the advice and
      assistance of two men of honor&mdash;of two men of resolution;&mdash;and I
      can reckon upon you two&mdash;can I not? At any hour, on whatever day it
      may be, upon a word from me, will you come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
      accents of the missionary. Agricola felt an oppression of the heart. If he
      should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance, what
      could be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend
      upon us,&rdquo; said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested&mdash;&ldquo;You
      have a father and a brother; make your own use of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, thanks,&rdquo; said Gabriel, &ldquo;you set me quite at
      ease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; resumed the soldier, &ldquo;were
      it not for your priest&rsquo;s robe, I should believe, from the manner in
      which you have spoken to us, that you are about to be engaged in a duel&mdash;in
      a mortal combat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a duel?&rdquo; said Gabriel, starting. &ldquo;Yes; it may be a
      duel&mdash;uncommon and fearful&mdash;at which it is necessary to have two
      witnesses such as you&mdash;A FATHER and A BROTHER!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
      increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
      Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.

      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE PAVILION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>izier House was
      one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone, in Paris. Nothing
      could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing than the aspect of
      this old mansion. Several immense windows, filled with small squares of
      glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre effect of the massive
      layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which the fabric was
      composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
      in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century. It was
      surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
      was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.
      One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
      an arcade led to the vast interior departments. The other front overlooked
      the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and, on this side,
      wings, approaching the principal part of the structure, formed a couple of
      lateral galleries. Like nearly all the other great habitations of this
      quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the garden, what the
      owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
      rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
      erection. It presented, in every part where it was possible for the stones
      to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of flowers,
      and chubby cupids. This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de Cardoville was
      composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a peristyle of several
      steps. A small vestibule led to a circular hall, lighted from the roof.
      Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of smaller rooms, concealed
      in the upper story, served for minor purposes.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
      transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
      the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
      entire structure repaired. The white stones of which it was built
      glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
      contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
      of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic clumps
      of verdant trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
      that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
      the Rue Brise-Miche. The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
      neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
      sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
      verdure over the summer-house. The door in the vestibule opened, and the
      rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
      two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
      in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its own,
      which was very striking. In plain terms two individuals, one of them a
      young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
      breed of spaniels called King Charles&rsquo;s, made their appearance under
      the peristyle of the rotunda. The name of the young girl was Georgette;
      the beautiful little spaniel&rsquo;s was Frisky. Georgette was in her
      eighteenth year. Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady&rsquo;s
      maid of Marivaux, a more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more
      roguish, teeth more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish,
      feet smaller, or form smarter, attractive, and enticing. Though it was yet
      very early, Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed. A tiny
      Valenciennes cap, with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion,
      decked with rose-colored ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands
      of beautiful fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of
      gray levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a
      large tuft of rose-colored ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly
      rounded; a hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large
      hems, surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round
      and flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
      allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves, reaching
      to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold. When Georgette raised
      the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more quickly the steps, she
      exhibited to Frisky&rsquo;s indifferent eyes a beautiful ankle, and the
      beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in white silk, and a
      charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish satin. When a blonde
      like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when vivid glances sparkle
      from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a joyous excitement suffuses
      her transparent skin, she is more resistless for the conquest of
      everything before her than a brunette.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10319m.jpg" alt="10319m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10319.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This bewitching and nimble lady&rsquo;s-maid, who on the previous evening
      had introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
      Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint Dizier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
      but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf. She was
      not much bigger than one&rsquo;s fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
      shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
      neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
      tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
      large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that they
      trailed upon the ground. Georgette seemed to be as brisk and petulant as
      Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,&mdash;now scampering after the happy
      little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon the
      greensward in her turn. All at once, at the sight of a second person, who
      advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
      stopped in their diversion. The little King Charles, some steps in advance
      of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held herself
      firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up of the
      enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which, though of
      ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp. The enemy consisted of a
      woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the color of coffee
      and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was pot-bellied; his
      skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side; he walked with his
      legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air of a doctor. His
      black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs sallying forth,
      and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and altogether he had an
      expression singularly forbidding and vindictive. This disagreeable animal,
      a perfect type of what might be called a &ldquo;church-goer&rsquo;s pug,&rdquo;
      answered to the name of &ldquo;My Lord.&rdquo; His mistress, a woman of
      about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was dressed in a
      costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay and showy. It
      consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat of the same dye.
      The features of this woman might have been agreeable in her youth; and her
      florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes, which were still very
      lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and austere physiognomy which
      she tried to assume. This matron, of slow and discreet gait, was Madame
      Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess Saint-Dizier. Not only did
      the age, the face, and the dress of these two women present a striking
      contrast; but the contrast extended itself even to the animals which
      attended them. There were similar differences between Frisky and My Lord,
      as between Georgette and Mrs. Grivois. When the latter perceived the
      little King Charles, she could not restrain a movement of surprise and
      repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the young lady&rsquo;s maid.
      Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the apparition of My Lord,
      regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance, and even advanced towards
      him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the cur, though thrice as big
      as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of distress and terror, and
      sought refuge behind Mrs. Grivois, who bitterly said to Georgette:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your
      dog thus, and setting him upon mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but
      ugly animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
      yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.
      But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
      and brought her back to my mistress. However,&rdquo; continued Georgette,
      &ldquo;to what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am commanded by the Princess,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grivois, unable
      to conceal a smile of triumphant satisfaction, &ldquo;immediately to see
      Miss Adrienne. It regards a very important affair, which I am to
      communicate only to herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
      start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied with
      watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl at
      with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome her
      temporary emotion, firmly answered: &ldquo;Miss Adrienne went to rest very
      late last night. She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an
      order of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to
      awaken your mistress immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress is subject to no one&rsquo;s orders in her own house;
      and I will not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands,&rdquo;
      replied Georgette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall go myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine and Hebe will not admit you. Indeed, here is the key of the
      saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne be
      entered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
      Princess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken
      my mistress!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for
      her niece,&rdquo; said the matron, with affected grief: &ldquo;Miss
      Adrienne no longer respects her aunt&rsquo;s orders; and she is surrounded
      by young hare-brained persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress
      themselves out as if for ball-going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the
      greatest coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess&rsquo;s
      women. At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as
      having been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to
      generation, even unto ours!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! from generation to generation! do you mean to insinuate that I
      am a hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is
      the utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess&rsquo;s
      house, who has too many tempers for the poor girls!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people
      ought not to pronounce but on their knees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Georgette, &ldquo;if one wished to speak ill
      of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A four-wheeler,&rdquo; continued Georgette, &ldquo;stopped at a few
      paces from the house. A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak,
      alighted from it, and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass
      of the porter&rsquo;s lodge window; and at one o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, the cab was still stationed in the street, waiting for the
      mysterious personage in the cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time,
      was, as you say, pronouncing the name of her Highness the Princess on his
      knees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mrs. Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
      Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
      middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
      of General Simon&rsquo;s daughters; or whether Mrs. Grivois thought it
      necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
      shoulders disdainfully: &ldquo;I know not what you, mean, madame. I have
      not come here to listen to your impertinent stuff. Once again I ask you&mdash;will
      you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has
      forbidden me to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
      spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
      terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs. Grivois,
      extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: &ldquo;Great heavens! is
      it possible? what have I seen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo; said Georgette, turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I seen?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Grivois, with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: what was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adrienne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Georgette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her run up the porch steps. I perfectly recognized her by her
      gait, by her hat, and by her mantle. To come home at eight o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grivois: &ldquo;it is perfectly
      incredible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See my lady? Why, you came to see her!&rdquo; and Georgette burst
      out into fits of laughter: and then said: &ldquo;Oh! I understand! you
      wish to out-do my story of the four-wheeler last night! It is very neat of
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, &ldquo;that I have this moment
      seen&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! adone, Mrs. Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am mad, am I? because I have a pair of good eyes! The little gate
      that open&rsquo;s on the street lets one into the quincunx near the
      pavilion. It is by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.
      Oh, what shameful conduct! what will the Princess say to it! Ah! her
      presentiments have not yet been mistaken. See to what her weak indulgence
      of her niece&rsquo;s caprices has led her! It is monstrous!&mdash;so
      monstrous, that, though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can
      scarcely believe it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve gone so far, ma&rsquo;am, I now insist upon
      conducting you into the apartment of my lady, in order that you may
      convince yourself, by your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I! You
      propose my going now! Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
      this time I shall find her in her apartment!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, I assure you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine,
      nor Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours. The Princess will put an
      end to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what
      has passed. To go out in the night! Re-enter at eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning! Why, I am all in a whirl! Certainly, if I had not seen it with my
      own eyes, I could not have believed it! Still, it is only what was to be
      expected. It will astonish nobody. Assuredly not! All those to whom I am
      going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
      astonishing! Oh! what a blow to our respectable Princess! What a blow for
      her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
      fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
      order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs. Grivois had seen her, or
      fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout an hour had
      elapsed since Mrs. Grivois had seen or pretended to have seen Adrienne de
      Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of Saint-Dizier House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible, the
      following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the light
      some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss de
      Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined to
      a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
      insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
      beautiful. The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
      sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
      did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
      in the chosen favorites of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
      gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
      the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
      voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
      one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from the
      sight of a hideous object. Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of their
      sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally with the
      delights of music or those of plastic beauty. It is necessary, alas, to
      acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food! She valued more
      than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the delicate savor of
      a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous cluster of a generous
      vine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve. She
      sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her. She would
      have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by excesses,
      or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which to exercise
      them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the excessive and
      imperious delicacy of her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and EVIL
      holds for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
      the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
      passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
      in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
      expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
      of SENSUALITY&mdash;not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
      sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
      necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
      sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The independence of this young lady&rsquo;s character was extreme. Certain
      humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
      above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
      resolve to withdraw herself from them. She was a woman, the most womanish
      that it is possible to imagine&mdash;a woman in her timidity as well as in
      her audacity&mdash;a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men,
      as well as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even
      and blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her&mdash;a
      woman whose piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical&mdash;a superior
      woman, in brief, who entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for
      certain men either placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from
      time to time met in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess
      Saint-Dizier, when she resided with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
      the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
      represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred in
      the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
      Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne&rsquo;s dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly
      one erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the
      Maker who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by
      her, or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
      contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
      with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
      may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
      splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
      perfections in the eyes of all. Daylight was admitted into this
      semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived for
      the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany. The walls of
      the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth of
      the aperture for the windows was therefore very great. That of Adrienne&rsquo;s
      dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a single
      large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of ground
      glass. In the interval or space of about three feet left between these two
      transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with furze mould,
      whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round the ground
      glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers. A garnet damask
      tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest style,
      covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended over
      the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
      marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
      decorations of the chamber.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10327m.jpg" alt="10327m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10327.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne&rsquo;s
      dressing case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith. Upon a
      large tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their
      lids precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
      implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
      mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
      extraordinary taste. Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
      purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place of
      a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
      every day like a nosegay for a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
      diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
      filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
      a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors. At the
      farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
      surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
      enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
      modesty and youthful beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
      those two charming figures. A coffer of frosted silver, set off with small
      figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet of gilt
      bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two frosted
      Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent drawings from
      Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting of portraits
      of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles of oriental
      jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver gilt, richly
      chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich divan, some
      seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture of this
      chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the sweetest
      perfumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
      before her toilette, her three women surrounding her. By a caprice, or
      rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
      with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
      the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
      attention and with a charming originality. We have already seen Georgette,
      a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an intriguing lady&rsquo;s
      maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite equal to her both in
      gracefulness and gentility.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
      with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.
      Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
      long golden pin. Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
      facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
      charming mistress. She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
      Venetian painters. Her petticoat was very ample. Her slender waist curved
      in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
      minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons. The third of Adrienne&rsquo;s
      women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so pleasing,
      and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of Hebe. Her
      dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her charming
      neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders. The physiognomy of
      these three young women was laughter loving and happy. On their features
      there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing and hated
      obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded deference, which
      are the ordinary results of a state of servitude. In the zealous eagerness
      of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon Adrienne, there
      seemed to be at least as much of affection as of deference and respect.
      They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from the services which they
      rendered to their lovely mistress. One would have thought that they
      attached to the dressing and embellishment of her person all the merits
      and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a work of art, in the
      accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they were stimulated by the
      passions of love, of pride, and of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
      window. Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
      than usual. She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
      embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
      waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
      years, by a girdle with floating tags. Her neck, delicately slender and
      flexible as a bird&rsquo;s, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and
      arms, and all were of incomparable beauty. Despite the vulgarity of the
      comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
      whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
      that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots of
      her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
      like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
      auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,&mdash;the
      roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
      nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished. In every spot,
      indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat, could
      make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it proclaimed her
      high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her glorious youth.
      Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness. Now they glanced,
      sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and wit; and now
      they widened and extended themselves, languishing and swimming between
      their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep a black as her
      finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a delightful freak
      of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to contrast with the
      golden red of her hair. Her forehead, small like those of ancient Grecian
      statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect oval. Her nose,
      delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of her teeth
      glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
      voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
      and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure. It is impossible to
      behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
      elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
      and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.
      We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
      of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
      Vinci,&mdash;that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
      delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
      mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
      let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
      like another Venus arising from the sea. At the present moment, Adrienne&rsquo;s
      tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare, stood behind
      her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her small white
      hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent brightness was
      doubled in the sunshine. When the pretty lady&rsquo;s-maid pulled a comb
      of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves of that
      enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a thousand
      sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all directions.
      The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays from numerous
      clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne&rsquo;s
      forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
      the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they adapted
      and applied themselves. Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the beautiful
      locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and having upon
      the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied herself in
      fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and crossed its
      slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh color, which
      imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world. Florine, a little
      farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled box, a perfumed
      paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling hands and
      outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their extremities.
      Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her mistress, opened
      her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe the different
      operations of Adrienne&rsquo;s toilette with grave and reflective
      attention. A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
      from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
      a small silver-gilt salve. Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
      her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
      the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
      and read aloud as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HONORED MADAME,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address
      you with respectful confidence. During twenty years I served the late
      Count and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly
      say, with probity and zeal. The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife,
      in our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
      of all resources: which, alas! is very hard at our time of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor creature!&rdquo; said Adrienne, interrupting herself in
      reading: &ldquo;my father, certainly, always prided himself upon their
      devotion to him, and their probity.&rdquo; She continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place
      here; but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
      consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
      our bread at such a price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, very good,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;always the same&mdash;dignity
      even in poverty&mdash;it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less
      sweet because it has bloomed in a meadow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task
      exacted from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that
      M. Rodin came here from Paris two days ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! M. Rodin!&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting
      herself anew; &ldquo;the secretary of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny! I am not at
      all surprised at him being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue. But
      let us see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was
      sold, and that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our
      place, if we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character
      upon the new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to
      attain this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a
      deserving and excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.
      Even that is not all. I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M.
      Rodin, and to relate to him everything that should occur in the house. I
      ought to acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were
      as much as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
      pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill it
      was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and substantially
      what I have now had the honor of stating to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!&rdquo;
      said Adrienne, with disgust: &ldquo;I cannot think of such wretches
      without involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black,
      venomous, and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed. How much more
      do I love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his
      wife!&rdquo; Adrienne proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, we hesitated not an instant. We quit Cardoville, which
      has been our home for the last twenty years;&mdash;but we shall quit it
      like honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity. And now,
      honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move&mdash;you,
      who are so benevolent and amiable&mdash;could find a place for us by your
      recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
      a position of most cruel embarrassment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;they shall not in vain
      appeal to me. To wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not
      only a duty but a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous
      enterprise; and dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!&rdquo;
      Adrienne again went on reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame,
      permit us to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would
      be wicked to think only of one&rsquo;s self. Three days ago, two
      shipwrecks took place upon our ironbound coast. A few passengers only were
      saved, and were conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all
      necessary attentions. All these passengers have departed for Paris, except
      one, who still remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from
      leaving the house, and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some
      days to come. He is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of
      age, and he appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is
      not a little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
      countrymen, as I understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Indian prince! twenty years of age! young, amiable, and
      handsome!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; &ldquo;this is quite
      delightful, and not at all of an ordinary or vulgar nature! Oh! this
      Indian prince has already awakened all my sympathies! But what can I do
      with this Adonis from the banks of the Ganges, who has come to wreck
      himself upon the Picardy coast?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne&rsquo;s three women looked at her with much astonishment, though
      they were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.
      Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
      pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
      as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
      recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
      interested by the situation of the &ldquo;Adonis from Ganges banks,&rdquo;
      as she had called him, continued to read Dupont&rsquo;s letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained
      to attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince
      has lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
      Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
      greatest importance. It is not from the prince himself that I have
      obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud to
      proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
      confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
      compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
      father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by the
      English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very singular,&rdquo; said Adrienne, thoughtfully. &ldquo;These
      circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one of
      our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that General
      Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his service.&rdquo;
      Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added, &ldquo;Gracious!
      this affair will be quite odd and fantastical! Such things happen to
      nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon creature! But it
      seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in truth, sometimes
      shows itself very eccentric! But let us see if worthy Dupont gives the
      name of this handsome prince?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
      should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
      own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave and
      estimable prince involved in so much distress. In fine, lady, trust to me;
      I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only necessary
      to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of countenance of
      this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy of the interest
      which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf. It would be
      sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the purchase of
      some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian vestments in the
      shipwreck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! European clothing!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, gayly.
      &ldquo;Poor young prince! Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!
      Chance has sent hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as
      never to have worn the abominable European costume&mdash;those hideous
      habits, and frightful hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly,
      that in truth there is not a single good quality to be discovered in them,
      nor one spark of what can either captivate or attract! There comes to me
      at last a handsome young prince from the East, where the men are clothed
      in silk and cashmere. Most assuredly I&rsquo;ll not miss this rare and
      unique opportunity of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable
      temptation! No, no! not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont
      requests it! But the name&mdash;the name of this dear prince! Once more,
      what a singular event is this! If it should turn out to be that cousin
      from beyond the Ganges! During my childhood, I have heard so much in
      praise of his royal father! Oh! I shall be quite ravished to give his son
      the kind reception which he merits!&rdquo; And then she read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to
      give him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will
      confer a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present
      so unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it
      would perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince
      without being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you
      will be pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion. If, on
      the contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as
      it has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
      sing, King of Mundi.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma!&rdquo; said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
      recollections, &ldquo;Radja-sing! Yes&mdash;that is it! These are the very
      names that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was
      nothing more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our
      relation by marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from
      that character. Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing&mdash;once more, that is it&mdash;such
      names are not so common,&rdquo; she added, smiling, &ldquo;that one should
      either forget or confound them with others. This Djalma is my cousin!
      Brave and good&mdash;young and charming! above all, he has never worn the
      horrid European dress! And destitute of every resource! This is quite
      ravishing! It is too much happiness at once! Quick, quick let us improvise
      a pretty fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the
      hero! The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
      dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
      of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!&rdquo; Then, addressing one
      of her women, she said: &ldquo;Georgette, take paper and write, my child!&rdquo;
      The young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained
      materials for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her
      mistress: &ldquo;I await orders.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
      gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
      a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
      drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
      all others:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can render me a very great service,&mdash;and you will do it, I
      am sure, with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
      distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
      designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century. But the present affair
      is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;for
      a young man,&mdash;and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy that
      you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather, from
      the Indian Bacchus; yes&mdash;that will be more likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect
      propriety and correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest
      elegance. You will choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and
      endeavor, above all things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian
      manufacture; and you will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six
      splendid long cashmere shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange;
      as nothing suits brown complexions better than those colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days),
      you will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
      know so well. The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
      will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
      will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another quarter
      of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown friend, who,
      taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is necessary to
      preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe. You will add, that his
      friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures him to come to
      Paris immediately. If he objects that he is suffering, you will tell him
      that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will cause the
      bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he finds it quite
      commodious. Remember to make very humble excuses for the unknown friend
      not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even, modestly, a
      single elephant; for alas! palanquins are only to be seen at the opera;
      and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,&mdash;though this
      must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the
      journey as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue
      de Babylone (what predestination! that I should dwell in the street of
      BABYLON,&mdash;a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
      Oriental),&mdash;you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
      happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend,
      not to be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging
      in extravagant conjectures. Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
      in this affair,&mdash;of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,&mdash;is
      because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
      there is something more than a seeming act of folly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
      dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose. But she quickly
      resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, my old friend. I am something like that commander of ancient
      days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
      draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
      battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle&mdash;to
      my dear pew-dwelling aunt. Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
      me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent
      wife. If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please
      to understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
      this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,&mdash;for it
      is proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
      he is charming indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, adieu!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing Georgette, said she, &ldquo;Have you done writing, chit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, add this postscript.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.
      Spare nothing. You know I am quite a grand seigneur. I must use this
      masculine expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to
      yourselves (tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
      generosity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Georgette,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;bring me an envelope,
      and the letter, that I may sign it.&rdquo; Mademoiselle de Cardoville took
      the pen that Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed
      in it an order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he
      may require for expenses incurred on my account.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
      continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress&rsquo;s
      toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
      order to wait upon the princess, her aunt. From the sustained and
      immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne&rsquo;s
      dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
      seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her memory
      even the slightest words of her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, chit,&rdquo; said Adrienne to Hebe, &ldquo;send this letter
      immediately to M. Norval.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same silver bell was again rung from without. Hebe moved towards the
      door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
      execute the order of her mistress as to the letter. But Florine
      precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
      leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it please my lady for me to send this letter? I have occasion
      to go to the mansion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Florine, then,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;seeing that you
      wish it. Georgette, seal the letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
      letter, Hebe returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said she, re-entering, &ldquo;the working-man who
      brought back Frisky yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.
      He is very pale, and he appears quite sad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that he may already have need of me! I should be too happy!&rdquo;
      said Adrienne gayly. &ldquo;Show the excellent young man into the little
      saloon. And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine went out. Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
      little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.

      CHAPTER XXXV. THE INTERVIEW.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Adrienne de
      Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected her, she was dressed
      with extremely elegant simplicity. A robe of deep blue, perfectly fitted
      to her shape, embroidered in front with interlacings of black silk,
      according to the then fashion, outlined her nymph-like figure, and her
      rounded bosom. A French cambric collar, fastened by a large Scotch pebble,
      set as a brooch, served her for a necklace. Her magnificent golden hair
      formed a framework for her fair countenance, with an incredible profusion
      of long and light spiral tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
      believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
      obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
      though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell over
      upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his well
      polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a cap of
      fine woolen cloth, quite new. To sum up, his blue blouse, embroidered with
      red, showing off the nervous chest of the young blacksmith, and indicating
      his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful folds, put not the least
      constraint upon his free and easy gait, and became him much better than
      either frock-coat or dress-coat would have done. While awaiting Miss de
      Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a magnificent silver vase,
      admirably graven. A small tablet, of the same metal, fitted into a cavity
      of its antique stand, bore the words&mdash;&ldquo;Chased by JEAN MARIE,
      working chaser, 1831.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
      separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
      perceived the young lady&rsquo;s entrance. He started, and turned quickly
      round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-&ldquo;That is
      a beautiful vase, is it not, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very beautiful, madame,&rdquo; answered Agricola greatly
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may see from it that I like what is equitable.&rdquo; added
      Miss de Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;&mdash;&ldquo;an
      artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
      title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
      his name connected with his workmanship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame, so this name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the
      order of a rich goldsmith. When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed
      at my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
      having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
      ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
      goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand. In the absence of
      the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill. Is it not
      just, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
      more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
      little more at ease, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by
      such a proof of your sense of equity and justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are a mechanic, sir,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, &ldquo;I
      cannot but felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer. But please to
      be seated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
      silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of the
      same materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Agricola&rsquo;s hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
      embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
      him gayly: &ldquo;This poor little animal, to which I am very much
      attached, will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging
      complaisance, sir. And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I
      know not what good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have
      the pleasure of being useful to you in some affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Agricola, resolutely, &ldquo;my name is
      Baudoin: a blacksmith in the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the
      city. Yesterday you offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have
      come to request of you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had
      generously proposed. I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it
      causes me the greatest effort. The words blistered my lips, but now I
      shall be more at ease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne; &ldquo;but if you knew me, you would address me without fear.
      How much do you require?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, madame,&rdquo; answered Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. You don&rsquo;t know what sum?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10341m.jpg" alt="10341m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10341.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary
      to me, but also information as to what that sum is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, smiling, &ldquo;explain this
      to me. In spite of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at
      once, what it is that is required.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, in two words, I can state the truth. I have a food old
      mother, who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable
      her to bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she
      had picked up. It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
      happiness of doing. But in order to do so, I have only my labor. If I am
      dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest
      myself for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will interest yourself for her, madame?&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know her,&rdquo; exclaimed the blacksmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I do; yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo; said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. &ldquo;I understand you. But indeed you have a noble heart.
      Mother Bunch was right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch?&rdquo; said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very
      surprised air; for what he said to her was an enigma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, permit me to explain, to you. Mother Bunch is a poor and
      very industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up. She is
      deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch. But though,
      on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
      other, yet as regards the heart&mdash;as to delicacy&mdash;oh, lady, I am
      certain that your heart is of equal worth with hers! That was at once her
      own thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
      presented me with that beautiful flower.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, sincerely touched,
      &ldquo;that this comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else
      that you could say to me,&mdash;a heart that remains good and delicate, in
      spite of cruel misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy
      to be good, when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and
      generous, when we are rich. I accept, then, your comparison; but on
      condition that you will quickly put me in a situation to deserve it. Pray
      go on, therefore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
      always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises from
      independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness of
      sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
      protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
      and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and striking
      contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who inspired him
      with this sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I
      dread. I should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
      suspension of my employment. Among poor people, the poor help one another;
      and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our excellent
      neighbors, who would willingly succor her. But, they themselves are far
      from being well off; and as they would incur privations by assisting her,
      their little benefit would still be more painful to my mother than the
      endurance even of misery by herself. And besides, it is not only for my
      mother that my exertions are required, but for my father, whom we have not
      seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from Siberia, where he
      remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to his former
      general, now Marshal Simon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshal Simon!&rdquo; said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of
      much surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the marshal, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What joy!&rdquo; exclaimed the blacksmith, &ldquo;then the two
      young ladies, his daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are
      your relations!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Marshal Simon two daughters?&rdquo; asked Adrienne, more and
      more astonished and interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so
      pretty, so sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for
      one another. Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed
      having been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the
      depths of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them
      forget so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his
      tenderness. My excellent father! you will not believe, madame, that, with
      the courage of a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are the dear children, sir?&rdquo; asked Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At our home, madame. It is that which renders my position so very
      hard; that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that
      my labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus
      augmented; but that I am about to be arrested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About to be arrested? For what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been
      sent by some one to Mother Bunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
      received by the workwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
      surprise, &ldquo;It appears, sir, you are a poet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.
      Only, when I return to my mother after a day&rsquo;s toil, and often, even
      while forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
      myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this
      letter, is, therefore, very disaffected&mdash;very dangerous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary. For myself, I have the good
      fortune to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the
      condition of his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate
      comrades is the reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of
      the great mass of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and
      earnest claim&mdash;nothing more. But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that
      in times of conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and
      imprisoned on very slight grounds. Should such a misfortune befall me,
      what will become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are
      bound to regard as part of our family until the return of their father,
      Marshal Simon? It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the
      risk of being arrested. I have come to you to request you to provide
      surety for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop
      for the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my
      labor will suffice for all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the stars!&rdquo; said Adrienne, gayly, &ldquo;this affair
      will arrange itself quite easily. Henceforth, Mr. Poet, you shall draw
      your inspirations in the midst of good fortune instead of adversity. Sad
      muse! But first of all, bonds shall be given for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame, you have saved us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To continue,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;the physician of our
      family is intimately connected with a very important minister (understand
      that, as you like,&rdquo; said she, smiling, &ldquo;you will not deceive
      yourself much). The doctor exercises very great influence over this great
      statesman; for he has always had the happiness of recommending to him, on
      account of his health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very
      eve of the day on which his portfolio was taken from him. Keep yourself,
      then, perfectly at ease. If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able
      to devise some other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Agricola, with great emotion, &ldquo;I am
      indebted to you for the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother. Believe
      that I shall ever be grateful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all quite simple. Now for another thing. It is proper that
      those who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of
      those who have too little. Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters are members of
      my family, and they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.
      You will apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides
      going to thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young
      relations, I shall fetch them home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
      from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
      exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? Explain yourself,&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate,&rdquo;
      said Georgette; &ldquo;where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively
      examining the walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to
      the pavilion, as if they wished to spy out some one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Agricola, with chagrin, &ldquo;I have not been
      deceived. They are after me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.
      Merry: and now it is beyond doubt. They must have seen me enter your
      house; and are on the watch to arrest me. Well, now that your interest has
      been acquired for my mother,&mdash;now that I have no farther uneasiness
      for Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters,&mdash;rather than hazard your
      exposure to anything the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of that sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, quickly. &ldquo;Liberty
      is too precious to be voluntarily sacrificed. Besides, Georgette may have
      been mistaken. But in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.
      Take my advice, and escape being arrested. That, I think, will greatly
      facilitate my measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great
      desire to keep possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look,
      &ldquo;a man knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a
      blue blouse has not entered here. He added, that the person whom he seeks
      is named Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
      importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;but the
      important information is a trick to draw me out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;and therefore we must play
      off trick for trick. What did you answer, child?&rdquo; added she,
      addressing herself to Hebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answered, that I didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Adrienne: &ldquo;and the man who put the
      question?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went away, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt to come back again, soon,&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very probable,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;and therefore,
      sir, it is necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation. I
      am unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier,
      my aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and
      is rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
      daughters of Marshal Simon. Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
      you will certainly be arrested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought
      not to accept this generous offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with
      the power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will
      come in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable. Now that
      I am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
      fears,&mdash;nothing? Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who
      loves you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;&mdash;say, sir, do
      you forget them also? Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to
      your family. Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
      giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
      annoyances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they
      will come and find me here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode
      of a nobleman&rsquo;s left-handed wife,&mdash;you see, sir,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, smiling, &ldquo;that live in a very profane place&mdash;there is
      here a secret place of concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it
      can defy all searches. Georgette will conduct you to it. You will be very
      well accommodated. You will even be able to write some verses for me, if
      the place inspire you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! how great is your goodness! how have I merited it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, I will tell you. Admitting that your character and your
      position do not entitle you to any interest;&mdash;admitting that I may
      not owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
      has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations&mdash;do
      you forget Frisky, sir?&rdquo; asked Adrienne, laughing,&mdash;&ldquo;Frisky,
      there, whom you have restored to my fondles? Seriously, if I laugh,&rdquo;
      continued this singular and extravagant creature, &ldquo;it is because I
      know that you are entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of
      happiness. Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your
      mother&rsquo;s, in this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some
      pretty verses, if you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to
      which you fly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe brought
      her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for Adrienne had
      to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the Princess
      Saint-Dizier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
      apartment of Mrs. Grivois, the first woman of the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Grivois of the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the notes which I have taken this morning,&rdquo; said
      Florine, putting a paper into the duenna&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Happily, I
      have a good memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time exactly did she return home this morning?&rdquo; asked
      the duenna, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adrienne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not go out, madame. We put her in the bath at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before nine o&rsquo;clock she came home, after having passed
      the night out of her house. Eight o&rsquo;clock was the time at which she
      returned, however.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine looked at Mrs. Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-&ldquo;I
      do not understand you, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Madame did not come home this morning at eight o&rsquo;clock?
      Dare you lie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning,
      in order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath. I
      know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alters the case. You must ferret out what I allude to from
      your companions. They don&rsquo;t distrust you, and will tell you all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
      permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
      down all I recollected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. And this letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Grivois: &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you
      bring it to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I
      knew the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the same thing. It is likely there was need to
      delay sending off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I did right, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that it is not good will that fails you. For these six
      months I have been satisfied with you. But this time you have committed a
      very great mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be indulgent, madame! what I do is sufficiently painful!&rdquo; The
      girl stifled a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear, do not continue it. If you have scruples, you
      are free. Go your way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You well know that I am not free, madame,&rdquo; said Florine,
      reddening; and with tears in her eyes she added: &ldquo;I am dependent
      upon M. Rodin, who placed me here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore these regrets, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of one&rsquo;s self, one feels remorse. Madame is so good,
      and so confiding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is all perfection, certainly! But you are not here to sing her
      praises. What occurred afterwards?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came
      early this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this working-man still in her house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He came in when I was going out with the
      letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the
      interview which she is to have to-day with the princess? She conceals so
      little of what she thinks, that you ought to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been as gay as usual. She has even jested about the
      interview!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! jested, has she?&rdquo; said the tire-woman, muttering between
      her teeth, without Florine being able to hear her: &ldquo;&lsquo;They
      laugh most who laugh last.&rsquo; In spite of her audacious and diabolical
      character, she would tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what
      awaits her this day.&rdquo; Then addressing Florine, she continued-&ldquo;Return,
      and keep yourself, I advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be
      quite enough to do you a bad turn. Do not forget!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, let it be so. Farewell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
      house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.

      CHAPTER XXXVI. A FEMALE JESUIT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the
      preceding scenes which occurred in the Pompadour rotunda, occupied by Miss
      de Cardoville, other events took place in the residence of the Princess
      Saint-Dizier. The elegance and sumptuousness of the former dwelling
      presented a strong contrast to the gloomy interior of the latter, the
      first floor of which was inhabited by the princess, for the plan of the
      ground floor rendered it only fit for giving parties; and, for a long time
      past, Madame de Saint-Dizier had renounced all worldly splendors. The
      gravity of her domestics, all aged and dressed in black; the profound
      silence which reigned in her abode, where everything was spoken, if it
      could be called speaking, in an undertone; and the almost monastic
      regularity and order of this immense mansion, communicated to everything
      around the princess a sad and chilling character. A man of the world, who
      joined great courage to rare independence of spirit, speaking of the
      princess (to whom Adrienne de Cardoville went, according to her
      expression, to fight a pitched battle), said of her as follows: &ldquo;In
      order to avoid having Madame de Saint-Dizier for an enemy, I, who am
      neither bashful nor cowardly, have, for the first time in my life, been
      both a noodle and a coward.&rdquo; This man spoke sincerely. But Madame de
      Saint-Dizier had not all at once arrived at this high degree of
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some words are necessary for the purpose of exhibiting distinctly some
      phases in the life of this dangerous and implacable woman who, by her
      affiliation with the Order of Jesuits, had acquired an occult and
      formidable power. For there is something even more menacing than a Jesuit:
      it is a Jesuits; and, when one has seen certain circles, it becomes
      evident that there exist, unhappily, many of those affiliated, who, more
      or less, uniformly dress (for the lay members of the Order call themselves
      &ldquo;Jesuits of the short robe&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-Dizier, once very beautiful, had been, during the last
      years of the Empire, and the early years of the Restoration, one of the
      most fashionable women of Paris, of a stirring, active, adventurous, and
      commanding spirit, of cold heart, but lively imagination. She was greatly
      given to amorous adventures, not from tenderness of heart, but from a
      passion for intrigue, which she loved as men love play&mdash;for the sake
      of the emotions it excites. Unhappily, such had always been the blindness
      or the carelessness of her husband, the Prince of Saint-Dizier (eldest
      brother of the Count of Rennepont and Duke of Cardoville, father of
      Adrienne), that during his life he had never said one word that could make
      it be thought that he suspected the actions of his wife. Attaching herself
      to Napoleon, to dig a mine under the feet of the Colossus, that design at
      least afforded emotions sufficient to gratify the humor of the most
      insatiable. During some time, all went well. The princess was beautiful
      and spirited, dexterous and false, perfidious and seductive. She was
      surrounded by fanatical adorers, upon whom she played off a kind of
      ferocious coquetry, to induce them to run their heads into grave
      conspiracies. They hoped to resuscitate the Fonder party, and carried on a
      very active secret correspondence with some influential personages abroad,
      well known for their hatred against the emperor and France. Hence arose
      her first epistolary relations with the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny, then
      colonel in the Russian service and aide-de-camp to General Moreau. But one
      day all these petty intrigues were discovered. Many knights of Madame de
      Saint-Dizier were sent to Vincennes; but the emperor, who might have
      punished her terribly, contented himself with exiling the princess to one
      of her estates near Dunkirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the Restoration, the persecutions which Madame de Saint-Dizier had
      suffered for the Good Cause were entered to her credit, and she acquired
      even then very considerable influence, in spite of the lightness of her
      behavior. The Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny, having entered the military
      service of France, remained there. He was handsome, and of fashionable
      manners and address. He had corresponded and conspired with the princess,
      without knowing her; and these circumstances necessarily led to a close
      connection between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excessive self-love, a taste for exciting pleasures, aspirations of
      hatred, pride, and lordliness, a species of evil sympathy, the perfidious
      attraction of which brings together perverse natures without mingling
      them, had made of the princess and the Marquis accomplices rather than
      lovers. This connection, based upon selfish and bitter feelings, and upon
      the support which two characters of this dangerous temper could lend to
      each other against a world in which their spirit of intrigue, of
      gallantry, and of contempt had made them many enemies, this connection
      endured till the moment when, after his duel with General Simon, the
      Marquis entered a religious house, without any one understanding the cause
      of his unexpected and sudden resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess, having not yet heard the hour of her conversion strike,
      continued to whirl round the vortex of the world with a greedy, jealous,
      and hateful ardor, for she saw that the last years of her beauty were
      dying out.
    </p>
    <p>
      An estimate of the character of this woman may be formed from the
      following fact:
    </p>
    <p>
      Still very agreeable, she wished to close her worldly and volatile career
      with some brilliant and final triumph, as a great actress knows the proper
      time to withdraw from the stage so as to leave regrets behind. Desirous of
      offering up this final incense to her own vanity, the princess skillfully
      selected her victims. She spied out in the world a young couple who
      idolized each other; and, by dint of cunning and address, she succeeded in
      taking away the lover from his mistress, a charming woman of eighteen, by
      whom he was adored. This triumph being achieved, Madame Saint-Dizier
      retired from the fashionable world in the full blaze of her exploit. After
      many long conversations with the Abbe Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who had
      become a renowned preacher, she departed suddenly from Paris, and spent
      two years upon her estate near Dunkirk, to which she took only one of her
      female attendants, viz., Mrs. Grivois.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the princess afterwards returned to Paris, it was impossible to
      recognize the frivolous, intriguing, and dissipated woman she had formerly
      been. The metamorphosis was as complete as it was extraordinary and even
      startling. Saint-Dizier House, heretofore open to the banquets and
      festivals of every kind of pleasure, became gloomily silent and austere.
      Instead of the world of elegance and fashion, the princess now received in
      her mansion only women of ostentatious piety, and men of consequence, who
      were remarkably exemplary by the extravagant rigor of their religious and
      monarchial principles. Above all, she drew around her several noted
      members of the higher orders of the clergy. She was appointed patroness of
      a body of religious females. She had her own confessor, chaplin, almoner,
      and even spiritual director; but this last performed his functions in
      partibus. The Marquis-Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny continued in reality to be her
      spiritual guide; and it is almost unnecessary to say that for a long time
      past their mutual relations as to flirting had entirely ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden and complete conversion of a gay and distinguished woman,
      especially as it was loudly trumpeted forth, struck the greater number of
      persons with wonder and respect. Others, more discerning, only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single anecdote, from amongst a thousand, will suffice to show the
      alarming influence and power which the princess had acquired since her
      affiliation with the Jesuits. This anecdote will also exhibit the deep,
      vindictive, and pitiless character of this woman, whom Adrienne de
      Cardoville had so imprudently made herself ready to brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the persons who smiled more or less at the conversion of Madame de
      Saint-Dizier were the young and charming couple whom she had so cruelly
      disunited before she quitted forever the scenes of revelry in which she
      had lived. The young couple became more impassioned and devoted to each
      other than ever; they were reconciled and married, after the passing storm
      which had hurled them asunder; and they indulged in no other vengeance
      against the author of their temporary infelicity than that of mildly
      jesting at the pious conversion of the woman who had done them so much
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, a terrible fatality overtook the loving pair. The
      husband, until then blindly unsuspicious, was suddenly inflamed by
      anonymous communications. A dreadful rupture ensued, and the young wife
      perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the husband, certain vague rumors, far from distinct, yet pregnant
      with secret meanings, perfidiously contrived, and a thousand times more
      detestable than formal accusations, which can, at least, be met and
      destroyed, were strewn about him with so much perseverance, with a skill
      so diabolical, and by means and ways so very various, that his best
      friends, by little and little, withdrew themselves from him, thus yielding
      to the slow, irresistible influence of that incessant whispering and
      buzzing, confused as indistinct, amounting to some such results as this-&ldquo;Well!
      you know!&rdquo; says one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; replies another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People say very vile things about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they? really! What then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! Bad reports! Rumors grievously affecting his
      honor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! That&rsquo;s very serious. It accounts for the coldness
      with which he is now everywhere received!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall avoid him in future!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the world, that very often nothing more than groundless surmises
      are necessary to brand a man whose very, happiness may have incurred envy.
      So it was with the gentleman of whom we speak. The unfortunate man, seeing
      the void around him extending itself,&mdash;feeling (so to speak) the
      earth crumbling from beneath his feet, knew not where to find or grasp the
      impalpable enemy whose blows he felt; for not once had the idea occurred
      to him of suspecting the princess, whom he had not seen since his
      adventure with her. Anxiously desiring to learn why he was so much shunned
      and despised, he at length sought an explanation from an old friend; but
      he received only a disdainfully evasive answer; at which, being
      exasperated, he demanded satisfaction. His adversary replied&mdash;&ldquo;If
      you can find two persons of our acquaintance, I will fight you!&rdquo; The
      unhappy man could not find one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, forsaken by all, without having ever obtained an explanation of
      the reason for forsaking him&mdash;suffering keenly for the fate of the
      wife whom he had lost, he became mad with grief, rage, and despair, and
      killed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of his death, Madame de Saint-Dizier remarked that it was fit
      and necessary that one who had lived so shamefully should come to an
      equally shameful end, and that he who had so long jested at all laws,
      human and divine, could not seemly otherwise terminate his wretched life
      than by perpetrating a last crime&mdash;suicide! And the friends of Madame
      de Saint-Dizier hawked about and everywhere repeated these terrible words
      with a contrite air, as if beatified and convinced! But this was not all.
      Along with chastisements there were rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observant people remarked that the favorites of the religious clan of
      Madame de Saint-Dizier rose to high distinction with singular rapidity.
      The virtuous young men, such as were religiously attentive to tiresome
      sermons, were married to rich orphans of the Sacred Heart Convents, who
      were held in reserve for the purpose; poor young girls, who, learning too
      late what it is to have a pious husband selected and imposed upon them by
      a set of devotees, often expiated by very bitter tears the deceitful favor
      of thus being admitted into a world of hypocrisy and falsehood, in which
      they found themselves strangers without support, crushed by it if they
      dared to complain of the marriages to which they had been condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the parlor of Madame de Saint-Dizier were appointed prefects, colonels,
      treasurers, deputies, academicians, bishops and peers of the realm, from
      whom nothing more was required in return for the all-powerful support
      bestowed upon them, but to wear a pious gloss, sometimes publicly take the
      communion, swear furious war against everything impious or revolutionary,&mdash;and
      above all, correspond confidentially upon &ldquo;different subjects of his
      choosing&rdquo; with the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,&mdash;an amusement,
      moreover, which was very agreeable; for the abbe was the most amiable man
      in the world, the most witty, and above all, the most obliging. The
      following is an historical fact, which requires the bitter and vengeful
      irony of Moliere or Pascal to do it justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last year of the Restoration, there was one of the mighty
      dignitaries of the court a firm and independent man, who did not make
      profession (as the holy fathers call it), that is, who did not communicate
      at the altar. The splendor amid which he moved was calculated to give the
      weight of a very injurious example to his indifference. The Abbe-Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      was therefore despatched to him; and he knowing the honorable and elevated
      character of the non communicant, thought that if he could only bring him
      to profess by any means (whatever the means might be) the effect would be
      what was desired. Like a man of intellect, the abbe prized the dogma but
      cheaply himself. He only spoke of the suitableness of the step, and of the
      highly salutary example which the resolution to adopt it would afford to
      the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Abbe,&rdquo; replied the person sought to be influenced, &ldquo;I
      have a greater respect for religion than you have. I should consider it an
      infamous mockery to go to the communion table without feeling the proper
      conviction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! you inflexible man! you frowning Alcestes,&rdquo; said
      the Marquis Abbe, smiling slyly. &ldquo;Your profits and your scruples
      will go together, believe me, by listening to me. In short, we shall
      manage to make it a BLANK COMMUNION for you; for after all, what is it
      that we ask?&mdash;only the APPEARANCE!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, a BLANK COMMUNION means breaking an unconsecrated wafer!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe-Marquis retired with his offers, which were rejected with
      indignation;&mdash;but then, the refractory man was dismissed from his
      place at court. This was but a single isolated fact. Woe to all who found
      themselves opposed to the interest and principles of Madame de Saint
      Dizier or her friends! Sooner or later, directly or indirectly, they felt
      themselves cruelly stabbed, generally immediately&mdash;some in their
      dearest connections, others in their credit, some in their honor; others
      in their official functions; and all by secret action, noiseless,
      continuous, and latent, in time becoming a terrible and mysterious
      dissolvent, which invisibly undermined reputations, fortunes, positions
      the most solidly established, until the moment when all sunk forever into
      the abyss, amid the surprise and terror of the beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will now be conceived how under the Restoration the Princess de Saint
      Dizier had become singularly influential and formidable. At the time of
      the Revolution of July (1830) she had &ldquo;rallied,&rdquo; and,
      strangely enough, by preserving some relation of family and of society
      with persons faithful to the worship of decayed monarchy, people still
      attributed to the princess much influence and power. Let us mention, at
      last, that the Prince of Saint-Dizier, having died many years since, his
      very large personal fortune had descended to his younger brother, the
      father of Adrienne de Cardoville; and he, having died eighteen months ago,
      that young lady found herself to be the last and only representative of
      that branch of the family of the Renneponts.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/10357.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Princess of Saint-Dizier awaited her niece in a very large room,
      rendered dismal by its gloomy green damask. The chairs, etc., covered with
      similar stuff, were of carved ebony. Paintings of scriptural and other
      religious subjects, and an ivory crucifix thrown up from a background of
      black velvet, contributed to give the apartment a lugubrious and austere
      aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-Dizier, seated before a large desk, has just finished
      putting the seals on numerous letters; for she had a very extensive and
      very diversified correspondence. Though then aged about forty-five she was
      still fair. Advancing years had somewhat thickened her shape, which
      formerly of distinguished elegance, was still sufficiently handsome to be
      seen to advantage under the straight folds of her black dress. Her
      headdress, very simple, decorated with gray ribbons, allowed her fair
      sleek hair to be seen arranged in broad bands. At first look, people were
      struck with her dignified though unassuming appearance; and would have
      vainly tried to discover in her physiognomy, now marked with repentant
      calmness, any trace of the agitations of her past life. So naturally grave
      and reserved was she, that people could not believe her the heroine of so
      many intrigues and adventures and gallantry. Moreover, if by chance she
      ever heard any lightness of conversation, her countenance, since she had
      come to believe herself a kind of &ldquo;mother in the Church,&rdquo;
      immediately expressed candid but grieved astonishment, which soon changed
      into an air of offended chastity and disdainful pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, her smile, when requisite, was still full of grace, and even
      of the seducing and resistless sweetness of seeming good-nature. Her large
      blue eyes, on fit occasions, became affectionate and caressing. But if any
      one dared to wound or ruffle her pride, gainsay her orders or harm her
      interests, her countenance, usually placid and serene, betrayed a cold but
      implacable malignity. Mrs. Grivois entered the cabinet, holding in her
      hand Florine&rsquo;s report of the manner in which Adrienne de Cardoville
      had spent the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois had been about twenty years in the service of Madame de
      Saint-Dizier. She knew everything that a lady&rsquo;s-maid could or ought
      to have known of her mistress in the days of her sowing of wild (being a
      lady) flowers. Was it from choice that the princess had still retained
      about her person this so-well-informed witness of the numerous follies of
      her youth? The world was kept in ignorance of the motive; but one thing
      was evident, viz., that Mrs. Grivois enjoyed great privileges under the
      princess, and was treated by her rather as a companion than as a tiring
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are Florine&rsquo;s notes, madame,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois,
      giving the paper to the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will examine them presently,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;but
      tell me, is my niece coming? Pending the conference at which she is to be
      present, you will conduct into her house a person who will soon be here,
      to inquire for you by my desire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man will make an exact inventory of everything contained in
      Adrienne&rsquo;s residence. You will take care that nothing is omitted;
      for that is of very great importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame. But should Georgette or Hebe make any opposition?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fear; the man charged with taking the inventory is of
      such a stamp, that when they know him, they will not dare to oppose either
      his making the inventory, or his other steps. It will be necessary not to
      fail, as you go along with him, to be careful to obtain certain
      peculiarities destined to confirm the reports which you have spread for
      some time past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not have the slightest doubt, madame. The reports have all the
      consistency of truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon, then, this Adrienne, so insolent and so haughty, will be
      crushed and compelled to pray for pardon; and from me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An old footman opened both of the folding doors, and announced the
      Marquis-Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Miss de Cardoville present herself,&rdquo; said the princess to
      Mrs. Grivois, &ldquo;you will request her to wait an instant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; said the duenna, going out with the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-Dizier and D&rsquo;Aigrigny remained alone.

      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE PLOT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Abbe-Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      as the reader has easily divined, was the person already seen in the Rue
      du Milieu-des-Ursins; whence he had departed from Rome, in which city he
      had remained about three months. The marquis was dressed in deep mourning,
      but with his usual elegance. His was not a priestly robe; his black coat,
      and his waistcoat, tightly gathered in at the waist, set off to great
      advantage the elegance of his figure: his black cassimere pantaloons
      disguised his feet, exactly fitted with lace boots, brilliantly polished.
      And all traces of his tonsure disappeared in the midst of the slight
      baldness which whitened slightly the back part of his head. There was
      nothing in his entire costume, or aspect, that revealed the priest,
      except, perhaps, the entire absence of beard, the more remarkable upon so
      manly a countenance. His chin, newly shaved, rested on a large and
      elevated black cravat, tied with a military ostentation which reminded the
      beholder, that this abbe-marquis this celebrated preacher&mdash;now one of
      the most active and influential chiefs of his order, had commanded a
      regiment of hussars upon the Restoration, and had fought in aid of the
      Russians against France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returned to Paris only this morning, the marquis had not seen the princess
      since his mother, the Dowager Marchioness d&rsquo;Aigrigny, had died near
      Dunkirk, upon an estate belonging to Madame de Saint-Dizier, while vainly
      calling for her son to alleviate her last moments; but the order to which
      M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny had thought fit to sacrifice the most sacred feeling
      and duties of nature, having been suddenly transmitted to him from Rome,
      he had immediately set out for that city; though not without hesitation,
      which was remarked and denounced by Rodin; for the love of M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      for his mother had been the only pure feeling that had invariably
      distinguished his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servant had discreetly withdrawn with Mrs. Grivois, the marquis
      quickly approached the princess, held out his hand to her, and said with a
      voice of emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herminia, have you not concealed something in your letters. In her
      last moments did not my mother curse me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Frederick, compose yourself. She had anxiously desired your
      presence. Her ideas soon became confused. But in her delirium it was still
      for you that she called.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the marquis, bitterly; &ldquo;her maternal
      instinct doubtless assured her that my presence could have saved her life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you to banish these sad recollections,&rdquo; said the
      princess, &ldquo;this misfortune is irreparable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me for the last time, truly, did not my absence cruelly affect
      my mother? Had she no suspicion that a more imperious duty called me
      elsewhere?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I assure you. Even when her reason was shaken, she believed
      that you had not yet had time to come to her. All the sad details which I
      wrote to you upon this painful subject are strictly true. Again, I beg of
      you to compose yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my conscience ought to be easy; for I have fulfilled my duty
      in sacrificing my mother. Yet I have never been able to arrive at that
      complete detachment from natural affection, which is commanded to us by
      those awful words: &lsquo;He who hates not his father and his mother, even
      with the soul, cannot be my disciple.&rsquo;&rdquo;(9)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, Frederick,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;these
      renunciations are painful. But, in return, what influence, what power!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the marquis, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. &ldquo;What ought not to be sacrificed in order to reign in
      secret over the all-powerful of the earth, who lord it in full day? This
      journey to Rome, from which I have just returned, has given me a new idea
      of our formidable power. For, Herminia, it is Rome which is the
      culminating point, overlooking the fairest and broadest quarters of the
      globe, made so by custom, by tradition, or by faith. Thence can our
      workings be embraced in their full extent. It is an uncommon view to see
      from its height the myriad tools, whose personality is continually
      absorbed into the immovable personality of our Order. What a might we
      possess! Verily, I am always swayed with admiration, aye, almost
      frightened, that man once thinks, wishes, believes, and acts as he alone
      lists, until, soon ours, he becomes but a human shell; its kernel of
      intelligence, mind, reason, conscience, and free will, shrivelled within
      him, dry and withered by the habit of mutely, fearingly bowing under
      mysterious tasks, which shatter and slay everything spontaneous in the
      human soul! Then do we infuse in such spiritless clay, speechless, cold,
      and motionless as corpses, the breath of our Order, and, lo! the dry bones
      stand up and walk, acting and executing, though only within the limits
      which are circled round them evermore. Thus do they become mere limbs of
      the gigantic trunk, whose impulses they mechanically carry out, while
      ignorant of the design, like the stonecutter who shapes out a stone,
      unaware if it be for cathedral or bagnio.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In so speaking, the marquis&rsquo;s features wore an incredible air of
      proud and domineering haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! this power is great, most great,&rdquo; observed the
      princess; &ldquo;and the more formidable because it moves in a mysterious
      way over minds and consciences.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, Herminia,&rdquo; said the marquis: &ldquo;I have had under my
      command a magnificent regiment. Very often have I experienced the
      energetic and exquisite enjoyment of command! At my word my squadrons put
      themselves in action; bugles blared, my officers, glittering in golden
      embroidery, galloped everywhere to repeat my orders: all my brave
      soldiers, burning with courage, and cicatrized by battles, obeyed my
      signal; and I felt proud and strong, holding as I did (so to speak) in my
      hands, the force and valor of each and all combined into one being of
      resistless strength and invincible intrepidity,&mdash;of all of which I
      was as much the master, as I mastered the rage and fire of my war-horse!
      Aye! that was greatness. But now, in spite of the misfortunes which have
      befallen our Order, I feel myself a thousand times more ready for action,
      more authoritative, more strong and more daring, at the head of our mute
      and black-robed militia, who only think and wish, or move and obey,
      mechanically, according to my will. On a sign they scatter over the
      surface of the globe, gliding stealthily into households under the guise
      of confessing the wife or teaching the children, into family affairs by
      hearing the dying avowals,&mdash;up to the throne through the quaking
      conscience of a credulous crowned coward;&mdash;aye, even to the chair of
      the Pope himself, living manifesto of the Godhead though he is, by the
      services rendered him or imposed by him. Is not this secret rule, made to
      kindle or glut the wildest ambition, as it reaches from the cradle to the
      grave, from the laborer&rsquo;s hovel to the royal palace, from palace to
      the papal chair? What career in all the world presents such splendid
      openings? what unutterable scorn ought I not feel for the bright butterfly
      life of early days, when we made so many envy us? Don&rsquo;t you
      remember, Herminia?&rdquo; he added, with a bitter smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, perfectly right, Frederick!&rdquo; replied the
      princess quickly. &ldquo;How little soever we may reflect, with what
      contempt do we not think upon the past! I, like you, often compare it with
      the present; and then what satisfaction I feel at having followed your
      counsels! For, indeed, without you, I should have played the miserable and
      ridiculous part which a woman always plays in her decline from having been
      beautiful and surrounded by admirers. What could I have done at this hour?
      I should have vainly striven to retain around me a selfish and ungrateful
      world of gross and shameful men, who court women only that they may turn
      them to the service of their passions, or to the gratification of their
      vanity. It is true that there would have remained to me the resource of
      what is called keeping an agreeable house for all others,&mdash;yes, in
      order to entertain them, be visited by a crowd of the indifferent, to
      afford opportunities of meeting to amorous young couples, who, following
      each other from parlor to parlor, come not to your house but for the
      purpose of being together; a very pretty pleasure, truly, that of
      harboring those blooming, laughing, amorous youths, who look upon the
      luxury and brilliancy with which one surrounds them, as if they were their
      due upon bonds to minister to their pleasure, and to their impudent
      amours!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words were so stinging, and such hateful envy sat upon her face, that
      she betrayed the intense bitterness of her regrets in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO, no; thanks to you, Frederick,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;After
      a last and brilliant triumph, I broke forever with the world, which would
      soon have abandoned me, though I was so long its idol and its queen. And I
      have only changed my queendom. Instead of the dissipated men whom I ruled
      with a frivolity superior to their own, I now find myself surrounded by
      men of high consideration, of redoubtable character, and all-powerful,
      many of whom have governed the state; to them I have devoted myself, as
      they have devoted themselves to me! It is now only that I really enjoy
      that happiness, of which I ever dreamt. I have taken an active part and
      have exercised a powerful influence over the greatest interests of the
      world; I have been initiated into the most important secrets; I have been
      able to strike, surely, whosoever scoffed at or hated me; and I have been
      able to elevate beyond their hopes those who have served or respected and
      obeyed me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some madmen, and some so blind, that they imagine that we
      are struck down, because we ourselves have had to struggle against some
      misfortunes,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, disdainfully, &ldquo;as if
      we were not, above all others, securely founded, organized for every
      struggle, and drew not from our very struggles a new and more vigorous
      activity. Doubtless the times are bad. But they will become better; and,
      as you know, it is nearly certain that in a few days (the 13th of
      February), we shall have at our disposal a means of action sufficiently
      powerful for re establishing our influence which has been temporarily
      shaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doubtless this affair of the medals is most important,&rdquo;
      said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have made so much haste to return hither,&rdquo;
      resumed the abbe, &ldquo;were it not to act in what will be, perhaps, for
      us, a very great event.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are aware of the fatality which has once again overthrown
      projects the most laboriously conceived and matured?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; immediately on arriving I saw Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he told you&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inconceivable arrival of the Indian, and of General Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters at Cardoville Castle, after a double shipwreck, which threw them
      upon the coast of Picardy; though it was deemed certain that the young
      girls were at Leipsic, and the Indian in Java. Precautions were so well
      taken, indeed,&rdquo; added the marquis in vexation, &ldquo;that one would
      think an invisible power protects this family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily, Rodin is a man of resources and activity,&rdquo; resumed
      the princess. &ldquo;He came here last night, and we had a long
      conversation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the result of your consultation is excellent,&rdquo; added the
      marquis: &ldquo;the old soldier is to be kept out of the way for two days;
      and his wife&rsquo;s confessor has been posted; the rest will proceed of
      itself. To morrow, the girls need no longer be feared; and the Indian
      remains at Cardoville, wounded dangerously. We have plenty of time for
      action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not all,&rdquo; continued the princess: &ldquo;there
      are still, without reckoning my niece, two persons, who, for our
      interests, ought not to be found in Paris on the 13th of February.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. Hardy: but his most dear and intimate friend has betrayed
      him; for, by means of that friend, we have drawn M. Hardy into the South,
      whence it is impossible for him to return before a month. As for that
      miserable vagabond workman, surnamed &lsquo;Sleepinbuff!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess, with an expression of outraged
      modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man,&rdquo; resumed the marquis, &ldquo;is no longer an object
      of inquietude. Lastly, Gabriel, upon whom our vast and certain hope
      reposes, will not be left by himself for a single minute until the great
      day. Everything seems, you see, to promise success; indeed, more so than
      ever; and it is necessary to obtain this success at any price. It is for
      us a question of life or death; for, in returning, I stopped at Forli, and
      there saw the Duke d&rsquo;Orbano. His influence over the mind of the king
      is all powerful&mdash;indeed, absolute; and he has completely prepossessed
      the royal mind. It is with the duke alone, then, that it is possible to
      treat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10365m.jpg" alt="10365m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10365.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Orbano has gained strength; and he can, I know it, assure
      to us a legal existence, highly protected, in the dominions of his master,
      with full charge of popular education. Thanks to such advantages, after
      two or three years in that country we shall become so deeply rooted, that
      this very Duke d&rsquo;Orbano, in his turn, will have to solicit support
      and protection from us. But at present he has everything in his power; and
      he puts an absolute condition upon his services.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the condition?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five millions down; and an annual pension of a hundred thousand
      francs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but little if it be considered that our foot once planted in
      that country, we shall promptly repossess ourselves of that sum, which,
      after all, is scarcely an eighth part of what the affair of the medals, if
      happily brought to an issue, ought to assure to the Order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, nearly forty millions,&rdquo; said the princess, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And again: these five millions that Orbano demands will be but an
      advance. They will be returned to us in voluntary gifts, by reason even of
      the increase of influence that we shall acquire from the education of
      children; through whom we have their families. And yet, the fools
      hesitate! those who govern see not, that in doing our own business, we do
      theirs also;&mdash;that in abandoning education to us (which is what we
      wish for above all things) we mold the people into that mute and quiet
      obedience, that servile and brutal submission, which assures the repose of
      states by the immobility of the mind. They don&rsquo;t reflect that most
      of the upper and middle classes fear and hate us; don&rsquo;t understand
      that (when we have persuaded the mass that their wretchedness is an
      eternal law, that sufferers must give up hope of relief, that it is a
      crime to sigh for welfare in this world, since the crown of glory on high
      is the only reward for misery here), then the stupefied people will
      resignedly wallow in the mire, all their impatient aspirations for better
      days smothered, and the volcano-blasts blown aside, which made the future
      of rulers so horrid and so dark? They see not, in truth, that this blind
      and passive faith which we demand from the mass, furnishes their rulers
      with a bridle with which both to conduct and curb them; whilst we ask from
      the happy of the world only some appearances which ought, if they had only
      the knowledge of their own corruption, to give an increased stimulant to
      their pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It signifies not,&rdquo; resumed the princess; &ldquo;since, as you
      say, a great day is at hand, bringing nearly forty millions, of which the
      Order can become possessed by the happy success of the affair of the
      medals. We certainly can attempt very great things. Like a lever in your
      hands, such a means of action would be of incalculable power, in times
      during which all men buy and sell one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; resumed M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with a thoughtful
      air, &ldquo;here the reaction continues: the example of France is
      everything. In Austria and Holland we can rarely maintain ourselves; while
      the resources of the Order diminish from day to day. We have arrived at a
      crisis; but it can be made to prolong itself. Thus, thanks to the immense
      resource of the affair of the medals, we can not only brave all
      eventualities, but we can again powerfully establish ourselves, thanks to
      the offer of the Duke d&rsquo;Orbano, which we accept; and then, from that
      inassailable centre, our radiations will be incalculable. Ah! the 13th of
      February!&rdquo; added M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, after a moment of silence, and
      shaking his head: &ldquo;the 13th of February, a date perhaps fortunate
      and famous for our power as that of the council which gave to us (so to
      say) a new life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing must be spared.&rdquo; resumed the princess, &ldquo;in
      order to succeed at any price. Of the six persons whom we have to fear,
      five are or will be out of any condition to hurt us. There remains then
      only my niece; and you know that I have waited but for your arrival in
      order to take my last resolution. All my preparations are completed; and
      this very morning we will begin to act.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your suspicions increased since your last letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am certain that she is more instructed than she wishes to
      appear; and if so, we shall not have a more dangerous enemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such has always been my opinion. Thus it is six month: since I
      advised you to take in all cases the measures which you have adopted, in
      order to provoke, on her part, that demand of emancipation, the
      consequences of which now render quite easy that which would have been
      impossible without it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; said the princess, with an expression of joy,
      hateful and bitter, &ldquo;this indomitable spirit will be broken. I am at
      length about to be avenged of the many insolent sarcasms which I have been
      compelled to swallow, lest I should awaken her suspicions. I! I to have
      borne so much till now! for this Adrienne has made it her business
      (imprudent as she is!) to irritate me against herself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whosoever offends you, offends me; you know it,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;my hatreds are yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you yourself!&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;how many times
      have you been the butt of her poignant irony!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My instincts seldom deceive me. I am certain that this young girl
      may become a dangerous enemy for us,&rdquo; said the marquis, with a voice
      painfully broken into short monosyllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, therefore, it is necessary that she may be rendered incapable
      of exciting further fear,&rdquo; responded Madame de Saint-Dizier, fixedly
      regarding the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Dr. Baleinier, and the sub-guardian, M. Tripeaud?&rdquo;
      asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be here this morning. I have informed them of everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find them well disposed to act against her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so&mdash;and the best is, Adrienne does not at all
      suspect the doctor, who has known how, up to a certain point, to preserve
      her confidence. Moreover, a circumstance which appears to me inexplicable
      has come to our aid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you allude to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, Mrs. Grivois went, according to my orders, to remind
      Adrienne that I expected her at noon, upon important business. As she
      approached the pavilion, Mrs. Grivois saw, or thought she saw, Adrienne
      come in by the little garden-gate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you tell me? Is it possible? Is there any positive proof of
      it?&rdquo; cried the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till now, there is no other proof than the spontaneous declaration
      of Mrs. Grivois: but whilst I think of it,&rdquo; said the Princess,
      taking up a paper that lay before her, &ldquo;here is the report, which,
      every day, one of Adrienne&rsquo;s women makes to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one that Rodin succeeded in introducing into your niece&rsquo;s
      service?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same; as this creature is entirely in Rodin&rsquo;s hands, she
      has hitherto answered our purpose very well. In this report, we shall
      perhaps find the confirmation of what Mrs. Grivois affirms she saw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the Princess glanced at the note, than she exclaimed almost in
      terror: &ldquo;What do I see? Why, Adrienne is a very demon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bailiff at Cardoville, having written to my niece to ask her
      recommendation, informed her at the same time of the stay of the Indian
      prince at the castle. She knows that he is her relation, and has just
      written to her old drawing-master, Norval, to set out post with Eastern
      dresses, and bring Prince Djalma hither&mdash;the man that must be kept
      away from Paris at any cost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis grew pale, and said to Mme. de Saint-Dizier: &ldquo;If this be
      not merely one of her whims, the eagerness she displays in sending for
      this relation hither, proves that she knows more than you even suspected.
      She is &lsquo;posted&rsquo; on the affair of the medals. Have a care&mdash;she
      may ruin all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the princess, resolutely, &ldquo;there is
      no room to hesitate. We must carry things further than we thought, and
      make an end this very morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, though it is almost impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, all is possible. The doctor and M. Tripeaud are ours,&rdquo;
      said the princess, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I am as sure as you are of the doctor, or of M. Tripeaud,
      under present circumstances, we must not touch on the question of acting&mdash;which
      will be sure to frighten them at first&mdash;until after our interview
      with your niece. It will be easy, notwithstanding her cleverness, to find
      out her armor&rsquo;s defect. If our suspicions should be realized&mdash;if
      she is really informed of what it would be so dangerous for her to know&mdash;then
      we must have no scruples, and above all no delay. This very day must see
      all set at rest. The time for wavering is past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been able to send for the person agreed on?&rdquo; asked
      the princess, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was to be here at noon. He cannot be long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought this room would do very well for our purpose. It is
      separated from the smaller parlor by a curtain only behind which your man
      may be stationed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a man to be depended on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so&mdash;we have often employed him in similar matters. He is
      as skillful as discreet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a low knock was heard at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the princess.

      at noon, by whose orders I have left him waiting in the oratory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the person in question,&rdquo; said the marquis to the
      princess. &ldquo;We must have him in first. &lsquo;Twould be useless for
      Dr. Baleinier to see him at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show this person in first,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;next
      when I ring the bell, you will beg Dr. Baleinier to walk this way: and, if
      Baron Tripeaud should call, you will bring him here also. After that, I am
      at home to no one, except Mdlle. Adrienne.&rdquo; The servant went out.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. ADRIENNE&rsquo;S ENEMIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Princess de
      Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s valet soon returned, showing in a little, pale man,
      dressed in black, and wearing spectacles. He carried under his left arm a
      long black morocco writing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess said to this man: &ldquo;M. l&rsquo;Abbe, I suppose, has
      already informed you of what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your highness,&rdquo; said the man in a faint, shrill, piping
      voice, making at the same time a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be conveniently placed in this room?&rdquo; asked the
      princess, conducting him to the adjoining apartment, which was only
      separated from the other by a curtain hung before a doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do nicely here, your highness,&rdquo; answered the man in
      spectacles, with a second and still lower bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, sir, please to step in here; I will let you know when
      it is time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait your highness&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray remember my instructions,&rdquo; added the marquis, as he
      unfastened the loops of the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be perfectly tranquil, M. l&rsquo;Abbe.&rdquo; The heavy
      drapery, as it fell, completely concealed the man in spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess touched the bell; some moments after, the door opened, and
      the servant announced a very important personage in this work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Baleinier was about fifty years of age, middling size, rather plump,
      with a full shining, ruddy countenance. His gray hair, very smooth and
      rather long, parted by a straight line in the middle, fell flat over his
      temples. He had retained the fashion of wearing short, black silk
      breeches, perhaps because he had a well-formed leg; his garters were
      fastened with small, golden buckles, as were his shoes of polished morocco
      leather; his coat, waistcoat, and cravat were black, which gave him rather
      a clerical appearance; his sleek, white hand was half hidden beneath a
      cambric ruffle, very closely plaited; on the whole, the gravity of his
      costume did not seem to exclude a shade of foppery.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was acute and smiling; his small gray eye announced rare
      penetration and sagacity. A man of the world and a man of pleasure, a
      delicate epicure, witty in conversation, polite to obsequiousness, supple,
      adroit, insinuating, Baleinier was one of the oldest favorites of the
      congregational set of the Princess de Saint-Dizier. Thanks to this
      powerful support, its cause unknown, the doctor, who had been long
      neglected, in spite of real skill and incontestable merit, found himself,
      under the Restoration, suddenly provided with two medical sinecures most
      valuable, and soon after with numerous patients. We must add, that, once
      under the patronage of the princess, the doctor began scrupulously to
      observe his religious duties; he communicated once a week, with great
      publicity, at the high mass in Saint Thomas Aquinas Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the year&rsquo;s end, a certain class of patients, led by the example
      and enthusiasm of Madame de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s followers, would have no
      other physician than Doctor Baleinier, and his practice was now increased
      to an extraordinary degree. It may be conceived how important it was for
      the order, to have amongst its &ldquo;plain clothes members&rdquo; one of
      the most popular practitioners of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      A doctor has in some sort a priesthood of his own. Admitted at all hours
      to the most secret intimacy of families, he knows, guesses, and is able to
      effect much. Like the priest, in short, he has the ear of the sick and the
      dying. Now, when he who cares for the health of the body, and he who takes
      charge of the health of the soul, understands each other, and render
      mutual aid for the advancement of a common interest, there is nothing
      (with certain exceptions), which they may not extract from the weakness
      and fears of a sick man at the last gasp&mdash;not for themselves (the
      laws forbid it)&mdash;but for third parties belonging more or less to the
      very convenient class of men of straw. Doctor Baleinier was therefore one
      of the most active and valuable assistant members of the Paris Jesuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the room, he hastened to kiss the princess&rsquo;s hand
      with the most finished gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always punctual, my dear M. Baleinier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always eager and happy to attend to your highness&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;
      Then turning towards the marquis, whose hand he pressed cordially, he
      added: &ldquo;Here we have you then at last. Do you know, that three
      months&rsquo; absence appears very long to your friends?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time is as long to the absent as to those who remain, my dear
      doctor. Well! here is the great day, Mdlle. de Cardoville is coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite easy,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;suppose she
      had any suspicion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier; &ldquo;we are
      the best friends in the world. You know, that Mdlle. Adrienne has always
      had great confidence in me. The day before yesterday, we laughed a good
      deal, and as I made some observations to her, as usual, on her eccentric
      mode of life, and on the singular state of excitement in which I sometimes
      found her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Baleinier never fails to insist on these circumstances, in
      appearance so insignificant,&rdquo; said Madame de Saint-Dizier to the
      marquis with a meaning look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are indeed very essential,&rdquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mdlle. Adrienne answered my observations,&rdquo; resumed the
      doctor, &ldquo;by laughing at me in the gayest and most witty manner; for
      I must confess, that this young lady has one of the aptest and most
      accomplished minds I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, doctor!&rdquo; said Madame de Saint-Dizier, &ldquo;no
      weakness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering immediately, M. Baleinier drew his gold snuff-box
      from his waistcoat pocket, opened it, and took slowly a pinch of snuff,
      looking all the time at the princess with so significant an air, that she
      appeared quite reassured. &ldquo;Weakness, madame?&rdquo; observed he at
      last, brushing some grains of snuff from his shirt-front with his plump
      white hand; &ldquo;did I not have the honor of volunteering to extricate
      you from this embarrassment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are the only person in the world that could render us this
      important service,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness sees, therefore,&rdquo; resumed the doctor, &ldquo;that
      I am not likely to show any weakness. I perfectly understand the
      responsibility of what I undertake; but such immense interests, you told
      me, were at stake&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;interests of the first
      consequence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I did not hesitate,&rdquo; proceeded M. Baleinier;
      &ldquo;and you need not be at all uneasy. As a man of taste, accustomed to
      good society, allow me to render homage to the charming qualities of
      Mdlle. Adrienne; when the time for action comes, you will find me quite as
      willing to do my work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, that moment may be nearer than we thought,&rdquo; said
      Madame de Saint-Dizier, exchanging a glance with D&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, and will be, always ready,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I
      answer for everything that concerns myself. I wish I could be as tranquil
      on every other point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not your asylum still as fashionable&mdash;as an asylum can well
      be?&rdquo; asked Madame de Saint-Dizier, with a half smile.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10373m.jpg" alt="10373m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10373.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. I might almost complain of having too many
      boarders. It is not that. But, whilst we are waiting for Mdlle. Adrienne,
      I will mention another subject, which only relates to her indirectly, for
      it concerns the person who, bought Cardoville Manor, one Madame de la
      Sainte-Colombe, who has taken me for a doctor, thanks to Rodin&rsquo;s
      able management.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny; &ldquo;Rodin wrote to me on the
      subject&mdash;but without entering into details.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the facts,&rdquo; resumed the doctor. &ldquo;This Madame
      de la Sainte Colombe, who was at first considered easy enough to lead, has
      shown herself very refractory on the head of her conversion. Two spiritual
      directors have already renounced the task of saving her soul. In despair,
      Rodin unslipped little Philippon on her. He is adroit, tenacious, and
      above all patient in the extreme&mdash;the very man that was wanted. When
      I got Madame de la Sainte-Colombe for a patient, Philippon asked my aid,
      which he was naturally entitled to. We agreed upon our plan. I was not to
      appear to know him the least in the world; and he was to keep me informed
      of the variations in the moral state of his penitent, so that I might be
      able, by the use of very inoffensive medicines&mdash;for there was nothing
      dangerous in the illness&mdash;to keep my patient in alternate states of
      improvement or the reverse, according as her director had reason to be
      satisfied or displeased&mdash;so that he might say to her: &lsquo;You see,
      madame, you are in the good way! Spiritual grace acts upon your bodily
      health, and you are already better. If, on the contrary, you fall back
      into evil courses, you feel immediately some physical ail, which is a
      certain proof of the powerful influence of faith, not only on the soul,
      but on the body also?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is doubtless painful,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny, with perfect
      coolness, &ldquo;to be obliged to have recourse to such means, to rescue
      perverse souls from perdition&mdash;but we must needs proportion our modes
      of action to the intelligence and the character of the individual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-bye, the princess knows,&rdquo; resumed the doctor, &ldquo;that
      I have often pursued this plan at St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, to the great
      advantage of the soul&rsquo;s peace and health of some of our patients,
      being extremely innocent. These alternations never exceed the difference
      between &lsquo;pretty well,&rsquo; and &lsquo;not quite so well.&rsquo;
      Yet small as are the variations, they act most efficaciously on certain
      minds. It was thus with Madame de la Sainte-Colombe. She was in such a
      fair way of recovery, both moral and physical, that Rodin thought he might
      get Philippon to advise the country for his penitent, fearing that Paris
      air might occasion a relapse. This advice, added to the desire the woman
      had to play &lsquo;lady of the parish,&rsquo; induced her to buy
      Cardoville Manor, a good investment in any respect. But yesterday,
      unfortunate Philippon came to tell me, that Madame de la Sainte-Colombe
      was about to have an awful relapse&mdash;moral, of course&mdash;for her
      physical health is now desperately good. The said relapse appears to have
      been occasioned by an interview she has had with one Jacques Dumoulin,
      whom they tell me you know, my dear abbe; he has introduced himself to
      her, nobody can guess how.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Jacques Dumoulin,&rdquo; said the marquis, with disgust,
      &ldquo;is one of those men, that we employ while we despise. He is a
      writer full of gall, envy, and hate, qualities that give him a certain
      unmercifully cutting eloquence. We pay him largely to attack our enemies,
      though it is often painful to see principles we respect defended by such a
      pen. For this wretch lives like a vagabond&mdash;is constantly in taverns&mdash;almost
      always intoxicated&mdash;but, I must own, his power of abuse is
      inexhaustible, and he is well versed in the most abstruse theological
      controversies, so that he is sometimes very useful to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! though Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is hard upon sixty, it
      appears that Dumoulin has matrimonial views on her large fortune. You will
      do well to inform Rodin, so that he may be on his guard against the dark
      designs of this rascal. I really beg a thousand pardons for having so long
      occupied you with such a paltry affair&mdash;but, talking of St. Mary&rsquo;s
      Convent,&rdquo; added the doctor, addressing the princess, &ldquo;may I
      take the liberty of asking if your highness has been there lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess exchanged a rapid glance with D&rsquo;Aigrigny, and answered:
      &ldquo;Oh, let me see! Yes, I was there about a week ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find great changes then. The wall that was next to my
      asylum has been taken down, for they are going to build anew wing and a
      chapel, the old one being too small. I must say in praise of Mdlle.
      Adrienne&rdquo; continued the doctor with a singular smile aside, &ldquo;that
      she promised me a copy of one of Raphael&rsquo;s Madonnas for this chapel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? very appropriate!&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;But here
      it is almost noon, and M. Tripeaud has not come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the deputy-guardian of Mdlle. de Cardoville, whose property
      he has managed, as former agent of the count-duke,&rdquo; said the
      marquis, with evident anxiety, &ldquo;and his presence here is absolutely
      indispensable. It is greatly to be desired that his coming should precede
      that of Mdlle. de Cardoville, who may be here at any moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unlucky that his portrait will not do as well,&rdquo; said
      the doctor, smiling maliciously, and drawing a small pamphlet from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, doctor?&rdquo; asked the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those anonymous sheets, which are published from time to
      time. It is called the &lsquo;Scourge,&rsquo; and Baron Tripeaud&rsquo;s
      portrait is drawn with such faithfulness, that it ceases to be satire. It
      is really quite life like; you have only to listen. The sketch is
      entitled: &lsquo;TYPE OF THE LYNX SPECIES.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Baron Tripeaud.&mdash;This man, who is as basely humble
      towards his social superiors, as he is insolent and coarse to those who
      depend upon him&mdash;is the living, frightful incarnation of the worst
      pardon of the moneyed and commercial aristocracy&mdash;one of the rich and
      cynical speculators, without heart, faith or conscience, who would
      speculate for a rise or fall on the death of his mother, if the death of
      his mother could influence the price of stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Such persons have all the odious vices of men suddenly
      elevated, not like those whom honest and patient labor has nobly enriched,
      but like those who owe their wealth to some blind caprice of fortune, or
      some lucky cast of the net in the miry waters of stock-jobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Once up in the world, they hate the people&mdash;because the
      people remind them of a mushroom origin of which they are ashamed. Without
      pity for the dreadful misery of the masses, they ascribe it wholly to
      idleness or debauchery because this calumny forms an excuse for their
      barbarous selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And this is not all. On the strength of his well-filled
      safe, mounted on his right of the candidate, Baron Tripeaud insults the
      poverty and political disfranchisement&mdash;of the officer, who, after
      forty years of wars and hard service, is just able to live on a scanty
      pension&mdash;Of the magistrate, who has consumed his strength in the
      discharge of stern and sad duties, and who is not better remunerated in
      his litter days&mdash;Of the learned man who has made his country
      illustrious by useful labors; or the professor who has initiated entire
      generations in the various branches of human knowledge&mdash;Of the modest
      and virtuous country curate, the pure representative of the gospel, in its
      charitable, fraternal, and democratic tendencies, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In such a state of things, how should our shoddy baron of
      in-dust-ry not feel the most sovereign contempt for all that stupid mob of
      honest folk, who, having given to their country their youth, their mature
      age, their blood, their intelligence, their learning, see themselves
      deprived of the rights which he enjoys, because he has gained a million by
      unfair and illegal transactions?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is true, that your optimists say to these pariahs of
      civilization, whose proud and noble poverty cannot be too much revered and
      honored: &ldquo;Buy an estate and you too may be electors and candidates!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But to come to the biography of our worthy baron&mdash;Andrew
      Tripeaud, the son of an ostler, at a roadside inn.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the folding-doors were thrown open, and the valet
      announced: &ldquo;The Baron Tripeaud!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Baleinier put his pamphlet into his pocket, made the most cordial bow
      to the financier, and even rose to give him his hand. The baron entered
      the room, overwhelming every one with salutations. &ldquo;I have the honor
      to attend the orders of your highness the princess. She knows that she may
      always count upon me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed rely upon you, M. Tripeaud, and particularly under
      present circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the intentions of your highness the princess are still the same
      with regard to Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are still the same, M. Tripeaud, and we meet to-day on that
      subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness may be assured of my concurrence, as, indeed, I have
      already promised. I think that the greatest severity must at length be
      employed, and that even if it were necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is also our opinion,&rdquo; said the marquis, hastily making a
      sign to the princess, and glancing at the place where the man in
      spectacles was hidden; &ldquo;we are all perfectly in harmony. Still, we
      must not leave any point doubtful, for the sake of the young lady herself,
      whose interests alone guides us in this affair. We must draw out her
      sincerity by every possible means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle has just arrived from the summer-house and wishes to
      see your highness,&rdquo; said the valet, again entering, after having
      knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that I wait for her,&rdquo; answered the princess; &ldquo;and
      now I am at home to no one&mdash;without exception. You understand me;
      absolutely to no one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, approaching the curtain behind which the man was concealed,
      Mme. de Saint-Dizier gave him the cue&mdash;after which she returned to
      her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is singular, but during the short space which preceded Adrienne&rsquo;s
      arrival, the different actors in this scene appeared uneasy and
      embarrassed, as if they had a vague fear of her coming. In about a minute,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville entered the presence of her aunt.

      CHAPTER XXXIX. THE SKIRMISH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n entering, Mdlle.
      de Cardoville threw down upon a chair the gray beaver hat she had worn to
      cross the garden, and displayed her fine golden hair, falling on either
      side of her face in long, light ringlets, and twisted in a broad knot
      behind her head. She presented herself without boldness, but with perfect
      ease: her countenance was gay and smiling; her large black eyes appeared
      even more brilliant than usual. When she perceived Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      she started in surprise, and her rosy lips were just touched with a
      mocking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      After nodding graciously to the doctor, she passed Baron Tripeaud by
      without looking at him, and saluted the princess with stately obeisance,
      in the most fashionable style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the walk and bearing of Mdlle. de Cardoville were extremely
      elegant, and full of propriety and truly feminine grace, there was about
      her an air of resolution and independence by no means common in women, and
      particularly in girls of her age. Her movements, without being abrupt,
      bore no traces of restraint, stiffness, or formality. They were frank and
      free as her character, full of life, youth, and freshness; and one could
      easily divine that so buoyant, straightforward, and decided a nature had
      never been able to conform itself to the rules of an affected rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, though he was a man of the world, a man of great talent,
      a churchman distinguished for his eloquence, and, above all, a person of
      influence and authority. Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny experienced an
      involuntary, incredible, almost painful uneasiness, in presence of
      Adrienne de Cardoville. He&mdash;generally so much the master of himself,
      so accustomed to exercise great power&mdash;who (in the name of his Order)
      had often treated with crowned heads on the footing of an equal, felt
      himself abashed and lowered in the presence of this girl, as remarkable
      for her frankness as for her biting irony. Now, as men who are accustomed
      to impose their will upon others generally hate those who, far from
      submitting to their influence, hamper it and make sport of them, it was no
      great degree of affection that the marquis bore towards the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time past, contrary to his usual habit, he had ceased to try
      upon Adrienne that fascinating address to which he had often owed an
      irresistible charm; towards her he had become dry, curt, serious, taking
      refuge in that icy sphere of haughty dignity and rigid austerity which
      completely hid all those amiable qualities with which he was endowed and
      of which, in general, he made such efficient use. Adrienne was much amused
      at all this, and thereby showed her imprudence&mdash;for the most vulgar
      motives often engender the most implacable hatreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these preliminary observations, the reader will understand the divers
      sentiments and interests which animated the different actors in the
      following scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-Dizier was seated in a large arm-chair by one side of the
      hearth. Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny was standing before the fire. Dr.
      Baleinier seated near a bureau, was again turning over the leaves of Baron
      Tripeaud&rsquo;s biography, whilst the baron appeared to be very
      attentively examining one of the pictures of sacred subjects suspended
      from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent for me, aunt, to talk upon matters of importance?&rdquo;
      said Adrienne, breaking the silence which had reigned in the
      reception-room since her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; answered the princess, with a cold and severe
      mien; &ldquo;upon matters of the gravest importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service, aunt. Perhaps we had better walk into your
      library?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary. We can talk here.&rdquo; Then, addressing the
      marquis, the doctor, and the baron, she said to them, &ldquo;Pray, be
      seated, gentlemen,&rdquo; and they all took their places round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can the subject of our interview interest these gentlemen,
      aunt?&rdquo; asked Mdlle. de Cardoville, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen are old family friends; all that concerns you must
      interest them, and their advice ought to be heard and accepted by you with
      respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt, aunt, of the bosom friendship of M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      for our family: I have still less of the profound and disinterested
      devotion of M. Tripeaud; M. Baleinier is one of my old friends; still,
      before accepting these gentlemen as spectators, or, if you will, as
      confidants of our interview, I wish to know what we are going to talk of
      before them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that, among your many singular pretensions, you had at
      least those of frankness and courage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, aunt,&rdquo; said Adrienne, smiling with mock humility,
      &ldquo;I have no more pretensions to frankness and courage than you have
      to sincerity and goodness. Let us admit, once for all, that we are what we
      are&mdash;without pretension.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Madame de Saint-Dizier, in a dry tone;
      &ldquo;I have long been accustomed to the freaks of your independent
      spirit. I suppose, then, that, courageous and frank as you say you are,
      you will not be afraid to speak before such grave and respectable persons
      as these gentlemen what you would speak to me alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a formal examination that I am to submit to? if so, upon what
      subject?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not an examination: but, as I have a right to watch over you,
      and as you take advantage of my weak compliance with your caprices, I mean
      to put an end to what has lasted too long, and tell you my irrevocable
      resolutions for the future, in presence of friends of the family. And,
      first, you have hitherto had a very false and imperfect notion of my power
      over you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, aunt, that I have never had any notion, true or
      false, on the subject&mdash;for I have never even dreamt about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my own fault; for, instead of yielding to your fancies, I
      should have made you sooner feel my authority; but the moment has come to
      submit yourself; the severe censures of my friends have enlightened me in
      time. Your character is self-willed, independent, stubborn; it must change&mdash;either
      by fair means or by force, understand me, it shall change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, pronounced harshly before strangers, with a severity which
      did not seem at all justified by circumstances, Adrienne tossed her head
      proudly; but, restraining herself, she answered with a smile: &ldquo;You
      say, aunt, that I shall change. I should not be astonished at it. We hear
      of such odd conversions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess bit her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sincere conversion can never be called odd, as you term it,
      madame,&rdquo; said Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, coldly. &ldquo;It is, on the
      contrary, meritorious, and forms an excellent example.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent?&rdquo; answered Adrienne: &ldquo;that depends! For
      instance, what if one converts defects into vices?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, madame?&rdquo; cried the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking of myself, aunt; you reproach me of being independent
      and resolute&mdash;suppose I were to become hypocritical and wicked? In
      truth, I prefer keeping my dear little faults, which I love like spoiled
      children. I know what I am; I do not know what I might be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must acknowledge, Mdlle. Adrienne,&rdquo; said Baron
      Tripeaud, with a self-conceited and sententious air, &ldquo;that a
      conversion&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10381m.jpg" alt="10381m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10381.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Adrienne, disdainfully, &ldquo;that M.
      Tripeaud is well versed in the conversion of all sorts of property into
      all sorts of profit, by all sorts of means&mdash;but he knows nothing of
      this matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame,&rdquo; resumed the financier, gathering courage from a
      glance of the princess, &ldquo;you forget that I have the honor to be your
      deputy guardian, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that M. Tripeaud has that honor,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with still more haughtiness, and not even looking at the baron; &ldquo;I
      could never tell exactly why. But as it is not now the time to guess
      enigmas, I wish to know, aunt, the object and the end of this meeting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be satisfied, madame. I will explain myself in a very
      clear and precise manner. You shall know the plan of conduct that you will
      have henceforth to pursue; and if you refuse to submit thereto, with the
      obedience and respect that is due to my orders, I shall at once see what
      course to take.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to give an idea of the imperious tone and stern look of
      the princess, as she pronounced these words which were calculated to
      startle a girl, until now accustomed to live in a great measure as she
      pleased: yet, contrary perhaps to the expectation of Madame de Saint
      Dizier, instead of answering impetuously, Adrienne looked her full in the
      face, and said, laughing: &ldquo;This is a perfect declaration of war. It&rsquo;s
      becoming very amusing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not talking of declarations of war,&rdquo; said the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      harshly, as if offended by the expressions of Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, M. l&rsquo;Abbe!&rdquo; returned Adrienne, &ldquo;for an old
      colonel, you are really too severe upon a jest!&mdash;you are so much
      indebted to &lsquo;war,&rsquo; which gave you a French regiment after
      fighting so long against France&mdash;in order to learn, of course, the
      strength and the weakness of her enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, which recalled painful remembrances, the marquis colored;
      he was going to answer, but the princess exclaimed: &ldquo;Really, madame,
      your behavior is quite intolerable!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, aunt, I acknowledge I was wrong. I ought not to have said
      this is very amusing&mdash;for it is not so, at all; but it is at least
      very curious&mdash;and perhaps,&rdquo; added the young girl, after a
      moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;perhaps very audacious and audacity pleases
      me. As we are upon this subject, and you talk of a plan of conduct to
      which I must conform myself, under pain of (interrupting herself)&mdash;under
      pain of what, I should like to know, aunt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know. Proceed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, in the presence of these gentlemen, also declare, in a very
      plain and precise manner, the determination that I have come to. As it
      required some time to prepare for its execution, I have not spoken of it
      sooner, for you know I am not in the habit of saying, &lsquo;I will do so
      and so!&rsquo; but I do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; and it is just this habit of culpable independence of
      which you must break yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had intended only to inform you of my determination at a
      later period; but I cannot resist the pleasure of doing so to-day, you
      seem so well disposed to hear and receive it. Still, I would beg of you to
      speak first: it may just so happen, that our views are precisely the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like better to see you thus,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;I
      acknowledge at least the courage of your pride, and your defiance of all
      authority. You speak of audacity&mdash;yours is indeed great.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at least decided to do that which others in their weakness
      dare not&mdash;but which I dare. This, I hope, is clear and precise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very clear, very precise,&rdquo; said the princess, exchanging a
      glance of satisfaction with the other actors in this scene. &ldquo;The
      positions being thus established, matters will be much simplified. I have
      only to give you notice, in your own interest, that this is a very serious
      affair&mdash;much more so than you imagine&mdash;and that the only way to
      dispose me to indulgence, is to substitute, for the habitual arrogance and
      irony of your language, the modesty and respect becoming a young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne smiled, but made no reply. Some moments of silence, and some
      rapid glances exchanged between the princess and her three friends, showed
      that these encounters, more or less brilliant in themselves, were to be
      followed by a serious combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had too much penetration and sagacity, not to remark,
      that the Princess de Saint-Dizier attached the greatest importance to this
      decisive interview. But she could not understand how her aunt could hope
      to impose her absolute will upon her: the threat of coercive measures
      appearing with reason a mere ridiculous menace. Yet, knowing the
      vindictive character of her aunt, the secret power at her disposal, and
      the terrible vengeance she had sometimes exacted&mdash;reflecting,
      moreover, that men in the position of the marquis and the doctor would not
      have come to attend this interview without some weighty motive&mdash;the
      young lady paused for a moment before she plunged into the strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon, the very presentiment of some vague danger, far from weakening
      her, gave her new courage to brave the worst, to exaggerate, if that were
      possible, the independence of her ideas, and uphold, come what might, the
      determination that she was about to signify to the Princess de Saint
      Dizier.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. THE REVOLT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the princess to Adrienne de Cardoville, in a
      cold, severe tone, &ldquo;I owe it to myself, as well as to these
      gentlemen, to recapitulate, in a few words, the events that have taken
      place for some time past. Six months ago, at the end of the mourning for
      your father, you, being eighteen years old, asked for the management of
      your fortune, and for emancipation from control. Unfortunately, I had the
      weakness to consent. You quitted the house, and established yourself in
      the extension, far from all superintendence. Then began a train of
      expenditures, each one more extravagant than the last. Instead of being
      satisfied with one or two waiting-women, taken from that class from which
      they are generally selected, you chose governesses for lady-companions,
      whom you dressed in the most ridiculous and costly fashion. It is true,
      that, in the solitude of your pavilion, you yourself chose to wear, one
      after another, costumes of different ages. Your foolish fancies and
      unreasonable whims have been without end and without limit: not only have
      you never fulfilled your religious duties, but you have actually had the
      audacity to profane one of your rooms, by rearing in the centre of it a
      species of pagan altar, on which is a group in marble representing a youth
      and a girl&rdquo;&mdash;the princess uttered these words as if they would
      burn her lips&mdash;&ldquo;a work of art, if you will, but a work in the
      highest degree unsuitable to a person of your age. You pass whole days
      entirely secluded in your pavilion, refusing to see any one; and Dr.
      Baleinier, the only one of my friends in whom you seem to have retained
      some confidence, having succeeded by much persuasion in gaining
      admittance, has frequently found you in so very excited a state, that he
      has felt seriously uneasy with regard to your health. You have always
      insisted on going out alone, without rendering any account of your actions
      to any one. You have taken delight in opposing, in every possible way,
      your will to my authority. Is all this true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The picture of my past is not much flattered,&rdquo; said Adrienne;
      smiling, &ldquo;but it is not altogether unlike.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you admit, madame,&rdquo; said Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, laying
      stress on his words, &ldquo;that all the facts stated by your aunt are
      scrupulously true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye was turned towards Adrienne, as if her answer would be of
      extreme importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. l&rsquo;Abbe,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I live openly enough
      to render this question superfluous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These facts are therefore admitted,&rdquo; said Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      turning towards the doctor and the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These facts are completely established,&rdquo; said M. Tripeaud, in
      a pompous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me, aunt,&rdquo; asked Adrienne, &ldquo;what is the
      good of this long preamble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This long preamble, madame,&rdquo; resumed the princess with
      dignity, &ldquo;exposes the past in order to justify the future.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, aunt, such mysterious proceedings are a little in the style
      of the answers of the Cumaean Sybil. They must be intended to cover
      something formidable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, mademoiselle&mdash;for to certain characters nothing is so
      formidable as duty and obedience. Your character is one of those inclined
      to revolt&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I freely acknowledge it, aunt&mdash;and it will always be so, until
      duty and obedience come to me in a shape that I can respect and love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether you respect and love my orders or not, madame,&rdquo; said
      the princess, in a curt, harsh voice, &ldquo;you will, from to-day, from
      this moment, learn to submit blindly and absolutely to my will. In one
      word, you will do nothing without my permission: it is necessary, I insist
      upon it, and so I am determined it shall be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne looked at her aunt for a second, and then burst into so free and
      sonorous a laugh, that it rang for quite a time through the vast
      apartment. D&rsquo;Aigrigny and Baron Tripeaud started in indignation. The
      princess looked angrily at her niece. The doctor raised his eyes to
      heaven, and clasped his hands over his waistcoat with a sanctimonious
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;such fits of
      laughter are highly unbecoming. Your aunt&rsquo;s words are serious, and
      deserve a different reception.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; said Adrienne, recovering herself, &ldquo;it is not
      my fault if I laugh. How can I maintain my gravity, when I hear my aunt
      talking of blind submission to her orders? Is the swallow, accustomed to
      fly upwards and enjoy the sunshine, fledged to live with the mole in
      darkness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this answer, D&rsquo;Aigrigny affected to stare at the other members of
      this kind of family council with blank astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A swallow? what does she mean?&rdquo; asked the abbe of the baron
      making a sign, which the latter understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; answered Tripeaud, staring in his turn at the
      doctor. &ldquo;She spoke too of a mole. It &lsquo;is quite unheard-of&mdash;incomprehensible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, madame,&rdquo; said the princess, appearing to share in the
      surprise of the others, &ldquo;this is the reply that you make to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, astonished herself that they
      should pretend not to understand the simile of which she had made use,
      accustomed as she was to speak in figurative language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, madame,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, smiling
      good-humoredly, &ldquo;we must be indulgent. My dear Mdlle. Adrienne has
      naturally so uncommon and excitable a nature! She is really the most
      charming mad woman I know; I have told her so a hundred times, in my
      position of an old friend, which allows such freedom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can conceive that your attachment makes you indulgent&mdash;but
      it is not the less true, doctor,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny, as if
      reproaching him for taking the part of Mdlle. de Cardoville, &ldquo;that
      such answers to serious questions are most extravagant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evil is, that mademoiselle does not seem to comprehend the
      serious nature of this conference,&rdquo; said the princess, harshly.
      &ldquo;She will perhaps understand it better when I have given her my
      orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear these orders, aunt,&rdquo; replied Adrienne as, seated
      on the other side of the table, opposite to the princess, she leaned her
      small, dimpled chin in the hollow of her pretty hand, with an air of
      graceful mockery, charming to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From to-morrow forward,&rdquo; resumed the princess, &ldquo;you
      will quit the summer-house which you at present inhabit, you will
      discharge your women, and come and occupy two rooms in this house, to
      which there will be no access except through my apartment. You will never
      go out alone. You will accompany me to the services of the church. Your
      emancipation terminates, in consequence of your prodigality duly proven. I
      will take charge of all your expenses, even to the ordering of your
      clothes, so that you may be properly and modestly dressed. Until your
      majority (which will be indefinitely postponed, by means of the
      intervention of a family-council), you will have no money at your own
      disposal. Such is my resolution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And certainly your resolution can only be applauded, madame,&rdquo;
      said Baron Tripeaud; &ldquo;we can but encourage you to show the greatest
      firmness, for such disorders must have an end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than time to put a stop to such scandal,&rdquo; added
      the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eccentricity and exaltation of temperament&mdash;may excuse many
      things,&rdquo; ventured to observe the smooth-tongued doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; replied the princess dryly to Baleinier, who
      played his part to perfection; &ldquo;but then, doctor, the requisite
      measures must be taken with such characters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-Dizier had expressed herself in a firm and precise manner;
      she appeared convinced of the possibility of putting her threats into
      execution. M. Tripeaud and D&rsquo;Aigrigny had just now given their full
      consent to the words of the princess. Adrienne began to perceive that
      something very serious was in contemplation, and her gayety was at once
      replaced by an air of bitter irony and offended independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose abruptly, and colored a little; her rosy nostrils dilated, her
      eyes flashed fire, and, as she raised her head, she gently shook the fine,
      wavy golden hair, with a movement of pride that was natural to her. After
      a moment&rsquo;s silence, she said to her aunt in a cutting tone: &ldquo;You
      have spoken of the past, madame; I also will speak a few words concerning
      it, since you force me to do so, though I may regret the necessity. I
      quitted your dwelling, because it was impossible for me to live longer in
      this atmosphere of dark hypocrisy and black treachery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;such words are as
      violent as they are unreasonable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you interrupt me, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily, as she
      fixed her eyes on the abbe, &ldquo;tell me what examples did I meet with
      in my aunt&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, examples, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, sir? Was it because I saw there, every day, her
      conversion keep pace with your own?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, you forget yourself!&rdquo; cried the princess, becoming
      pale with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I do not forget&mdash;I remember, like other people; that
      is all. I had no relation of whom I could ask an asylum. I wished to live
      alone. I wished to enjoy my revenues&mdash;because I chose rather to spend
      them myself, than to see them wasted by M. Tripeaud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; cried the baron, &ldquo;I cannot imagine how you can
      presume&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Adrienne, reducing him to silence by a gesture of
      overwhelming lordliness, &ldquo;I speak of you&mdash;not to you. I wished
      to spend my income,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;according to my own
      tastes. I embellished the retreat that I had chosen. Instead of ugly,
      ill-taught servants, I selected girls, pretty and well brought up, though
      poor. Their education forbade their being subjected to any humiliating
      servitude, though I have endeavored to make their situation easy and
      agreeable. They do not serve me, but render me service&mdash;I pay them,
      but I am obliged to them&mdash;nice distinctions that your highness will
      not understand, I know. Instead of seeing them badly or ungracefully
      dressed, I have given them clothes that suit their charming faces well,
      because I like whatever is young and fair. Whether I dress myself one way
      or the other, concerns only my looking-glass. I go out alone, because I
      like to follow my fancy. I do not go to mass&mdash;but, if I had still a
      mother, I would explain to her my devotions, and she would kiss me none
      the less tenderly. It is true, that I have raised a pagan altar to youth
      and beauty, because I adore God in all that He has made fair and good,
      noble and grand&mdash;because, morn and evening, my heart repeats the
      fervent and sincere prayer: &lsquo;Thanks, my Creator! thanks!&rsquo;&mdash;Your
      highness says that M. Baleinier has often found me in my solitude, a prey
      to a strange excitement: yes, it is true; for it is then that, escaping in
      thought from all that renders the present odious and painful to me, I find
      refuge in the future&mdash;it is then that magical horizons spread far
      before me&mdash;it is then that such splendid visions appear to me, as
      make me feel myself rapt in a sublime and heavenly ecstasy, as if I no
      longer appertained to earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Adrienne pronounced these last words with enthusiasm, her countenance
      appeared transfigured, so resplendent did it become. In that moment, she
      had lost sight of all that surrounded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is then,&rdquo; she resumed, with spirit soaring higher and
      higher, &ldquo;that I breathe a pure air, reviving and free&mdash;yes,
      free&mdash;above all, free&mdash;and so salubrious, so grateful to the
      soul!&mdash;Yes, instead of seeing my sisters painfully submit to a
      selfish, humiliating, brutal dominion, which entails upon them the
      seductive vices of slavery, the graceful fraud, the enchanting perfidy,
      the caressing falsehood, the contemptuous resignation, the hateful
      obedience&mdash;I behold them, my noble sisters! worthy and sincere
      because they are free, faithful and devoted because they have liberty to
      choose&mdash;neither imperious not base, because they have no master to
      govern or to flatter&mdash;cherished and respected, because they can
      withdraw from a disloyal hand their hand, loyally bestowed. Oh, my
      sisters! my sisters! I feel it. These are not merely consoling visions&mdash;they
      are sacred hopes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Carried away, in spite of herself, by the excitement of her feelings,
      Adrienne paused for a moment, in order to return to earth; she did not
      perceive that the other actors in this scene were looking at each other
      with an air of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What she says there is excellent,&rdquo; murmured the doctor in the
      princess&rsquo;s ear, next to whom he was seated; &ldquo;were she in
      league with us, she would not speak differently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only by excessive harshness,&rdquo; added D&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;that we shall bring her to the desired point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed as if the vexed emotion of Adrienne had been dissipated by
      the contact of the generous sentiments she had just uttered. Addressing
      Baleinier with a smile, she said: &ldquo;I must own, doctor, that there is
      nothing more ridiculous, than to yield to the current of certain thoughts,
      in the presence of persons incapable of understanding them. This would
      give you a fine opportunity to make game of that exaltation of mind for
      which you sometimes reproach me. To let myself be carried away by
      transports at so serious a moment!&mdash;for, verily, the matter in hand
      seems to be serious. But you see, good M. Baleinier, when an idea comes
      into my head, I can no more help following it out, than I could refrain
      from running after butterflies when I was a little girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And heaven only knows whither these brilliant butterflies of all
      colors,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, smiling with an air of paternal
      indulgence, &ldquo;that are passing through your brain, are likely to lead
      you. Oh, madcap, when will she be as reasonable as she is charming?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very instant, my good doctor,&rdquo; replied Adrienne. &ldquo;I
      am about to cast off my reveries for realities, and speak plain and
      positive language, as you shall hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which, addressing her aunt, she continued: &ldquo;You have imparted
      to me your resolution, madame; I will now tell you mine. Within a week, I
      shall quit the pavilion that I inhabit, for a house which I have arranged
      to my taste, where I shall live after my own fashion. I have neither
      father nor mother, and I owe no account of my actions to any but myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the princess, shrugging her
      shoulders, &ldquo;you talk nonsense. You forget that society has
      inalienable moral rights, which we are bound to enforce. And we shall not
      neglect them, depend upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So madame, it is you, and M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and M. Tripeaud,
      that represent the morality of society! This appears to me very fine. Is
      it because M. Tripeaud has considered (I must acknowledge it) my fortune
      as his own? Is it because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, really, madame,&rdquo; began Tripeaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In good time, madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne to her aunt, without
      noticing the baron, &ldquo;as the occasion offers, I shall have to ask you
      for explanations with regard to certain interests, which have hitherto, I
      think, been concealed from me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of Adrienne made D&rsquo;Aigrigny and the princess start, and
      then rapidly exchange a glance of uneasiness and anxiety. Adrienne did not
      seem to perceive it, but thus continued: &ldquo;To have done with your
      demands, madame, here is my final resolve. I shall live where and how I
      please. I think that, if I were a man, no one would impose on me, at my
      age, the harsh and humiliating guardianship you have in view, for living
      as I have lived till now&mdash;honestly, freely, and generously, in the
      sight of all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This idea is absurd! is madness!&rdquo; cried the princess. &ldquo;To
      wish to live thus alone, is to carry immorality and immodesty to their
      utmost limits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;what opinion must you
      entertain of so many poor girls, orphans like myself, who live alone and
      free, as I wish to live? They have not received, as I have, a refined
      education, calculated to raise the soul, and purify the heart. They have
      not wealth, as I have, to protect them from the evil temptations of
      misery; and yet they live honestly and proudly in their distress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vice and virtue do not exist for such tag-rag vermin!&rdquo; cried
      Baron Tripeaud, with an expression of anger and hideous disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, you would turn away a lackey, that would venture to speak
      thus before you,&rdquo; said Adrienne to her aunt, unable to conceal her
      disgust, &ldquo;and yet you oblige me to listen to such speeches!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny touched M. Tripeaud with his knee under the
      table, to remind him that he must not express himself in the princess&rsquo;s
      parlors in the same manner as he would in the lobbies of the Exchange. To
      repair the baron&rsquo;s coarseness, the abbe thus continued: &ldquo;There
      is no comparison, mademoiselle, between people of the class you name, and
      a young lady of your rank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a Catholic priest, M. l&rsquo;Abbe, that distinction is not
      very Christian,&rdquo; replied Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the purport of my words, madame,&rdquo; answered the abbe,
      dryly; &ldquo;besides the independent life that you wish to lead, in
      opposition to all reason, may tend to very serious consequences for you.
      Your family may one day wish to see you married&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare my family that trouble, sir, if I marry at all, I will
      choose for myself, which also appears to me reasonable enough. But, in
      truth, I am very little tempted by that heavy chain, which selfishness and
      brutality rivet for ever about our necks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indecent, madame,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;to speak
      so lightly of such an institution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you, especially, madame, I beg pardon for having shocked
      your highness! You fear that my independent planner of living will
      frighten away all wooers; but that is another reason for persisting in my
      independence, for I detest wooers. I only hope that they may have the very
      worst opinion of me, and there is no better means of effecting that
      object, than to appear to live as they live themselves. I rely upon my
      whims, my follies, my sweet faults, to preserve me from the annoyance of
      any matrimonial hunting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be quite satisfied on that head,&rdquo; resumed Madame de
      Saint Dizier, &ldquo;if unfortunately the report should gain credit, that
      you have carried the forgetfulness of all duty and decency, to such a
      height, as to return home at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. So I am
      told is the case but I cannot bring myself to believe such an enormity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, madame, for it is quite true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you confess it?&rdquo; cried the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess all that I do, madame. I came home this morning at eight
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear Gentlemen?&rdquo; ejaculated the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in a bass voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the baron, in a treble key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; muttered the doctor, with a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing these lamentable exclamations, Adrienne seemed about to speak,
      perhaps to justify herself; but her lip speedily assumed a curl of
      contempt, which showed that she disdained to stoop to any explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is true,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Oh, wretched girl,
      you had accustomed me to be astonished at nothing; but, nevertheless, I
      doubted the possibility of such conduct. It required your impudent and
      audacious reply to convince the of the fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, lying has always appeared to be more impudent than to speak
      the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where had you been, madame? and for what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne, interrupting her aunt, &ldquo;I never
      speak false&mdash;but neither do I speak more than I choose; and then
      again, it were cowardice to defend myself from a revolting accusation. Let
      us say no more about it: your importunities on this head will be
      altogether vain. To resume: you wish to impose upon me a harsh and
      humiliating restraint; I wish to quit the house I inhabit, to go and live
      where I please, at my own fancy. Which of us two will yield, remains to be
      seen. Now for another matter: this mansion belongs to me! As I am about to
      leave it, I am indifferent whether you continue to live here or not; but
      the ground floor is uninhabited. It contains, besides the reception-rooms,
      two complete sets of apartments; I have let them for some time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the princess, looking at D&rsquo;Aigrigny with
      intense surprise. &ldquo;And to whom,&rdquo; she added ironically, &ldquo;have
      you disposed of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To three members of my family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; said Mme. de Saint-Dizier, more and
      more astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, madame, that I wish to offer a generous hospitality to a
      young Indian prince, my kinsman on my mother&rsquo;s side. He will arrive
      in two or three days, and I wish to have the rooms ready to receive him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, gentlemen?&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny to the doctor and
      Tripeaud, with an affectation of profound stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surpasses all one could imagine!&rdquo; exclaimed the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; observed the doctor, benignantly, &ldquo;the impulse
      is generous in itself&mdash;but the mad little head crops out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said the princes. &ldquo;I cannot prevent you
      madame, from announcing the most extravagant designs but it is presumable
      that you will not stop short in so fair a path. Is that all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite, your highness. I learned this morning, that two of my
      female relations, also on my mother&rsquo;s side&mdash;poor children of
      fifteen&mdash;orphan daughters of Marshal Simon arrived yesterday from a
      long journey, and are now with the wife of the brave soldier who brought
      them to France from the depths of Siberia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words from Adrienne, D&rsquo;Aigrigny and the princess could not
      help starting suddenly, and staring at each other with affright, so far
      were they from expecting that Mdlle. de Cardoville was informed of the
      coming of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters. This discovery was like a
      thunder-clap to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no doubt astonished at seeing me so well informed,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne; &ldquo;fortunately, before I have done, I hope to astonish
      you still more. But to return to these daughters of Marshal Simon: your
      highness will understand, that it is impossible for me to leave them in
      charge of the good people who have afforded them a temporary asylum.
      Though this family is honest, and hard-working, it is not the place for
      them. I shall go and fetch them hither, and lodge them in apartments on
      the ground-floor, along with the soldier&rsquo;s wife, who will do very
      well to take care of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon these words, D&rsquo;Aigrigny and the baron looked at each other, and
      the baron exclaimed: &ldquo;Decidedly, she&rsquo;s out of her head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word to Tripeaud, Adrienne continued: &ldquo;Marshal Simon
      cannot fail to arrive at Paris shortly. Your highness perceives how
      pleasant it will he, to be able to present his daughters to him, and prove
      that they have been treated as they deserve. To-morrow morning I shall
      send for milliners and mantua makers, so that they may want for nothing. I
      desire their surprised father, on his return, to find them every way
      beautiful. They are pretty, I am told, as angels&mdash;but I will endeavor
      to make little Cupids of them.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, madame, you must have finished?&rdquo; said the princess,
      in a sardonic and deeply irritated tone, whilst D&rsquo;Aigrigny, calm and
      cold in appearance, could hardly dissemble his mental anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try again!&rdquo; continued the princess, addressing Adrienne.
      &ldquo;Are there no more relations that you wish to add to this
      interesting family-group? Really a queen could not act with more
      magnificence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! I wish to give my family a royal reception&mdash;such as is
      due to the son of a king, and the daughters of the Duke de Ligny. It is
      well to unite other luxuries of life with the luxury of the hospitable
      heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maxim is assuredly generous,&rdquo; said the princess, becoming
      more and more agitated; &ldquo;it is only a pity that you do not possess
      the mines of El Dorado to make it practicable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on the subject of a mine, said to be a rich one, that I also
      wished to speak to your highness. Could I find a better opportunity?
      Though my fortune is already considerable, it is nothing to what may come
      to our family at any moment. You will perhaps excuse, therefore, what you
      are pleased to call my royal prodigalities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s dilemma became momentarily more and more thorny.
      The affair of the medals was so important, that he had concealed it even
      from Dr. Baleinier, though he had called in his services to forward
      immense interests. Neither had Tripeaud been informed of it, for the
      princess believed that she had destroyed every vestige of those papers of
      Adrienne&rsquo;s father, which might have put him on the scent of this
      discovery. The abbe, therefore was not only greatly alarmed that Mdlle. de
      Cardoville might be informed of this secret, but he trembled lest she
      should divulge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess, sharing the alarms of D&rsquo;Aigrigny, interrupted her
      niece by exclaiming: &ldquo;Madame, there are certain family affairs which
      ought to be kept secret, and, without exactly understanding to what you
      allude, I must request you to change the subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, madame! are we not here a family party? Is that not
      sufficiently evident by the somewhat ungracious things that have been here
      said?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, madame! when affairs of interest are concerned, which
      are more or less disputable, it is perfectly useless to speak of them
      without the documents laid before every one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what have we been speaking this hour, madame, if not of
      affairs of interest? I really do not understand your surprise and
      embarrassment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am neither surprised nor embarrassed, madame; but for the last
      two hours, you have obliged me to listen to so many new and extravagant
      things, that a little amaze is very permissible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your highness&rsquo;s pardon, but you are very much
      embarrassed,&rdquo; said Adrienne, looking fixedly at her aunt, &ldquo;and
      M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny also&mdash;which confirms certain suspicions that I
      have not had the time to clear up. Have I then guessed rightly?&rdquo; she
      added, after a pause. &ldquo;We will see&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I command you to be silent,&rdquo; cried the princess, no
      longer mistress of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;for a person who has in
      general so much command of her feelings, you compromise yourself
      strangely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Providence (as some will have it) came to the aid of the princess and the
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny at this critical juncture. A valet entered the room;
      his countenance bore such marks of fright and agitation, that the princess
      exclaimed as soon as she saw him: &ldquo;Why, Dubois! what is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to beg pardon, your highness, for interrupting you against
      your express orders, but a police inspector demands to speak with you
      instantly. He is below stairs, and the yard is full of policemen and
      soldiers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the profound surprise which this new incident occasioned
      her, the princess, determining to profit by the opportunity thus afforded,
      to concert prompt measures with D&rsquo;Aigrigny on the subject of
      Adrienne&rsquo;s threatened revelations, rose, and said to the abbe:
      &ldquo;Will you be so obliging as to accompany me, M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      for I do not know what the presence of this commissary of police may
      signify.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Aigrigny followed the speaker into the next room.

      CHAPTER XLI. TREACHERY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Princess de
      Saint-Dizier, accompanied by D&rsquo;Aigrigny, and followed by the
      servants, stopped short in the next room to that in which had remained
      Adrienne, Tripeaud and the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the commissary?&rdquo; asked the princess of the servant,
      who had just before announced to her the arrival of that magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the blue saloon, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My compliments, and beg him to wait for me a few moments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed and withdrew. As soon as he was gone Madame de Saint Dizier
      approached hastily M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, whose countenance, usually firm
      and haughty, was now pale and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; cried the princess in a hurried voice, &ldquo;Adrienne
      knows all. What shall we do?&mdash;what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; said the abbe, with a fixed and absent look.
      &ldquo;This disclosure is a terrible blow to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all, then, lost?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one means of safety,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny;&mdash;&ldquo;the
      doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; cried the princess. &ldquo;So, sudden? this very
      day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours hence, it will be too late; ere then, this infernal girl
      will have seen Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Frederick!&mdash;it is impossible! M. Baleinier will
      never consent. I ought to have been prepared before hand as we intended,
      after to-day&rsquo;s examination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; replied the abbe, quickly; &ldquo;the doctor must
      try at any hazard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But under what pretext?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try and find one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you were to find a pretext, Frederick, and we could act
      immediately&mdash;nothing would be ready down there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied: they are always ready there, by habitual foresight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How instruct the doctor on the instant?&rdquo; resumed the
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To send for him would be to rouse the suspicions of your niece,&rdquo;
      said M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, thoughtfully; &ldquo;and we must avoid that
      before everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered the princess; &ldquo;her confidence in
      the doctor is one of our greatest resources.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a way,&rdquo; said the abbe quickly; &ldquo;I will write a
      few words in haste to Baleinier: one of your people can take the note to
      him, as if it came from without&mdash;from a patient dangerously ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent idea!&rdquo; cried the princess. &ldquo;You are right.
      Here&mdash;upon this table&mdash;there is everything necessary for
      writing. Quick! quick&mdash;But will the doctor succeed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, I scarcely dare to hope it,&rdquo; said the marquis,
      sitting down at the table with repressed rage. &ldquo;Thanks to this
      examination, going beyond our hopes, which our man, hidden behind the
      curtain, has faithfully taken down in shorthand&mdash;thanks to the
      violent scenes, which would necessarily have occurred to-morrow and the
      day after&mdash;the doctor, by fencing himself round with all sorts of
      clever precautions, would have been able to act with the most complete
      certainty. But to ask this of him to-day, on the instant!&mdash;Herminia&mdash;it
      is folly to think of!&rdquo;&mdash;The marquis threw down the pen which he
      held in his hand; then he added, in a tone of bitter and profound
      irritation: &ldquo;At the very moment of success&mdash;to see all our
      hopes destroyed!&mdash;Oh, the consequences of all this are incalculable.
      Your niece will be the cause of the greatest mischief&mdash;oh! the
      greatest injury to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the expression of deep rage and implacable
      hatred with which D&rsquo;Aigrigny uttered these last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo; cried the princess with anxiety, as she clasped
      her hands strongly around the abbe&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I conjure you, do not
      despair!&mdash;The doctor is fertile in resources, and he is so devoted to
      us. Let us at least, make the attempt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it is at least a chance,&rdquo; said the abbe, taking up
      the pen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should it come to the worst.&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;and
      Adrienne go this evening to fetch General Simon&rsquo;s daughters, she may
      perhaps no longer find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot hope for that. It is impossible that Rodin&rsquo;s orders
      should have been so quickly executed. We should have been informed of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. Write then to the doctor; I will send you Dubois, to
      carry your letter. Courage, Frederick! we shall yet be too much for that
      ungovernable girl.&rdquo; Madame de Saint-Dizier added, with concentrated
      rage: &ldquo;Oh, Adrienne! Adrienne! you shall pay dearly for your
      insolent sarcasms, and the anxiety you have caused us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went out, the princess turned towards M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and said
      to him: &ldquo;Wait for me here. I will tell you the meaning of this visit
      of the police, and we will go in together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess disappeared. D&rsquo;Aigrigny dashed off a few words, with a
      trembling hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. THE SNARE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the departure
      of Madame de Saint-Dizier and the marquis, Adrienne had remained in her
      aunt&rsquo;s apartment with M. Baleinier and Baron Tripeaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing of the commissary&rsquo;s arrival, Mdlle. de Cardoville had
      felt considerable uneasiness; for there could be no doubt that, as
      Agricola had apprehended, this magistrate was come to search the hotel and
      extension, in order to find the smith, whom he believed to be concealed
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she looked upon Agricola&rsquo;s hiding-place as a very safe one,
      Adrienne was not quite tranquil on his account; so in the event of any
      unfortunate accident, she thought it a good opportunity to recommend the
      refugee to the doctor, an intimate friend, as we have said, of one of the
      most influential ministers of the day. So, drawing near to the physician,
      who was conversing in a low voice with the baron, she said to him in her
      softest and most coaxing manner: &ldquo;My good M. Baleinier, I wish to
      speak a few words with you.&rdquo; She pointed to the deep recess of one
      of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your orders, madame,&rdquo; answered the doctor, as he rose
      to follow Adrienne to the recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Tripeaud, who, no longer sustained by the abbe&rsquo;s presence,
      dreaded the young lady as he did fire, was not sorry for this diversion.
      To keep up appearances, he stationed himself before one of the sacred
      pictures, and began again to contemplate it, as if there were no bounds to
      his admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mdlle. de Cardoville was far enough from the baron, not to be
      overheard by him, she said to the physician, who, all smiles and
      benevolence, waited for her to explain: &ldquo;My good doctor, you are my
      friend, as you were my father&rsquo;s. Just now, notwithstanding the
      difficulty of your position, you had the courage to show yourself my only
      partisan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, madame; do not go and say such things!&rdquo; cried the
      doctor, affecting a pleasant kind of anger. &ldquo;Plague on&rsquo;t! you
      would get me into a pretty scrape; so pray be silent on that subject. Vade
      retro Satanas!&mdash;which means: Get thee behind me, charming little
      demon that you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, with a smile; &ldquo;I
      will not compromise you. Only allow me to remind you, that you have often
      made me offers of service, and spoken to me of your devotion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put me to the test&mdash;and you will see if I do not keep my
      promises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! give me a proof on the instant,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! this is how I like to be taken at my word. What can I do
      for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still very intimate with your friend the minister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am just treating him for a loss of voice, which he always
      has, the day they put questions to him in the house. He likes it better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to obtain from him something very important for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you? pray, what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, the valet entered the room, delivered a letter to M.
      Baleinier, and said to him: &ldquo;A footman has just brought this letter
      for you, sir; it is very pressing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician took the letter, and the servant went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is one of the inconveniences of merit,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      smiling; &ldquo;they do not leave you a moment&rsquo;s rest, my poor
      doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak of it, madame,&rdquo; said the physician, who could
      not conceal a start of amazement, as he recognized the writing of D&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;these patients think we are made of iron, and have monopolized the
      health which they so much need. They have really no mercy. With your
      permission, madame,&rdquo; added M. Baleinier, looking at Adrienne before
      he unsealed the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville answered by a graceful nod. Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      letter was not long; the doctor read it at a single glance, and,
      notwithstanding his habitual prudence, he shrugged his shoulders, and said
      hastily: &ldquo;Today! why, it&rsquo;s impossible. He is mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak no doubt of some poor patient, who has placed all his
      hopes in you&mdash;who waits and calls for you at this moment. Come, my
      dear M. Baleinier, do not reject his prayer. It is so sweet to justify the
      confidence we inspire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was at once so much analogy, and such contradiction, between the
      object of this letter, written just before by Adrienne&rsquo;s most
      implacable enemy, and these words of commiseration which she spoke in a
      touching voice, that Dr. Baleinier himself could not help being struck
      with it. He looked at Mdlle. de Cardoville with an almost embarrassed air,
      as he replied: &ldquo;I am indeed speaking of one of my patients, who
      counts much upon me&mdash;a great deal too much&mdash;for he asks me to do
      an impossibility. But why do you feel so interested in an unknown person?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is unfortunate, I know enough to interest me. The person for
      whom I ask your assistance with the minister, was quite as little known to
      me; and now I take the deepest interest in him. I must tell you, that he
      is the son of the worthy soldier who brought Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters from the heart of Siberia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! he is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An honest workman, the support of his family; but I must tell you
      all about it&mdash;this is how the affair took place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The confidential communication which Adrienne was going to make to the
      doctor, was cut short by Madame Saint-Dizier, who, followed by M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      opened abruptly the door. An expression of infernal joy, hardly concealed
      beneath a semblance of extreme indignation, was visible in her
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny threw rapidly, as he entered the apartment, an
      inquiring and anxious glance at M. Baleinier. The doctor answered by a
      shake of the head. The abbe bit his lips with silent rage; he had built
      his last hopes upon the doctor, and his projects seemed now forever
      annihilated, notwithstanding the new blow which the princess had in
      reserve for Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Madame de Saint-Dizier, in a sharp, hurried
      voice, for she was nearly choking with wicked pleasure, &ldquo;gentlemen,
      pray be seated! I have some new and curious things to tell you, on the
      subject of this young lady.&rdquo; She pointed to her niece, with a look
      of ineffable hatred and disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child, what is the matter now?&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, in
      a soft, wheedling tone, before he left the window where he was standing
      with Adrienne. &ldquo;Whatever happens, count upon me!&rdquo;&mdash;And
      the physician went to seat himself between M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny and M.
      Tripeaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her aunt&rsquo;s insolent address, Mdlle. de Cardoville had proudly
      lined her head. The blood rushed to her face, and irritated at the new
      attacks with which she was menaced, she advanced to the table where the
      princess was seated, and said in an agitated voice to M. Baleinier:
      &ldquo;I shall expect you to call on me as soon as possible, my dear
      doctor. You know that I wish particularly to speak with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne made one step towards the arm-chair, on which she had left her
      hat. The princess rose abruptly, and exclaimed: &ldquo;What are you doing,
      madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to retire. Your highness has expressed to me your will,
      and I have told you mine. It is enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her hat. Madame de Saint-Dizier, seeing her prey about to escape,
      hastened towards her niece, and, in defiance of all propriety, seized her
      violently by the arm with a convulsive grasp, and bade her, &ldquo;Remain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, madame!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, with an accent of painful
      contempt, &ldquo;have we sunk so low?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to escape&mdash;you are afraid!&rdquo; resumed Madame de
      Saint-Dizier, looking at her disdainfully from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words &ldquo;you are afraid,&rdquo; you could have made
      Adrienne de Cardoville walk into a fiery furnace. Disengaging her arm from
      her aunt&rsquo;s grasp, with a gesture full of nobleness and pride, she
      threw down the hat upon the chair, and returning to the table, said
      imperiously to the princess: &ldquo;There is something even stronger than
      the disgust with which all this inspires me&mdash;the fear of being
      accused of cowardice. Go on, madame! I am listening!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With her head raised, her color somewhat heightened, her glance half
      veiled by a tear of indignation, her arms folded over her bosom, which
      heaved in spite of herself with deep emotion, and her little foot beating
      convulsively on the carpet, Adrienne looked steadily at her aunt. The
      princess wished to infuse drop by drop, the poison with which she was
      swelling, and make her victim suffer as long as possible, feeling certain
      that she could not escape. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Madame de
      Saint-Dizier, in a forced voice, &ldquo;this has occurred: I was told that
      the commissary of police wished to speak with me: I went to receive this
      magistrate; he excused himself, with a troubled air, for the nature of the
      duty he had to perform. A man, against whom a warrant was out, had been
      seen to enter the garden-house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne started, there could be no doubt that Agricola was meant. But she
      recovered her tranquillity, when she thought of the security of the
      hiding-place she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The magistrate,&rdquo; continued the princess, &ldquo;asked my
      consent to search the hotel and extension, to discover this man. It was
      his right. I begged him to commence with the garden-house, and accompanied
      him. Notwithstanding the improper conduct of Mademoiselle, it never, I
      confess, entered my head for a moment, that she was in any way mixed up
      with this police business. I was deceived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, madame?&rdquo; cried Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know all, madame,&rdquo; said the princess, with a
      triumphant air, &ldquo;in good time. You were in rather too great a hurry
      just now, to show yourself so proud and satirical. Well! I accompanied the
      commissary in his search; we came to the summer-house; I leave you to
      imagine the stupor and astonishment of the magistrate, on seeing three
      creatures dressed up like actresses. At my request, the fact was noted in
      the official report; for it is well to reveal such extravagances to all
      whom it may concern.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;The princess acted very wisely,&rdquo; said Tripeaud, bowing;
      &ldquo;it is well that the authorities should be informed of such matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, too much interested in the fate of the workman to think of
      answering Tripeaud or the princess, listened in silence, and strove to
      conceal her uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The magistrate,&rdquo; resumed Madame de Saint-Dizier, &ldquo;began
      by a severe examination of these young girls; to learn if any man had,
      with their knowledge, been introduced into the house; with incredible
      effrontery, they answered that they had seen nobody enter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The true-hearted, honest girls!&rdquo; thought Mademoiselle de
      Cardoville, full of joy; &ldquo;the poor workman is safe! the protection
      of Dr. Baleinier will do the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; continued the princess, &ldquo;one of my women,
      Mrs. Grivois, had accompanied me. This excellent person, remembering to
      have seen Mademoiselle return home at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
      remarked with much simplicity to the magistrate, that the man, whom they
      sought, might probably have entered by the little garden gate, left open,
      accidentally, by Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been well, madame,&rdquo; said Tripeaud, &ldquo;to
      have caused to be noted also in the report, that Mademoiselle had returned
      home at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see the necessity for this,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      faithful to his part: &ldquo;it would have been quite foreign to the
      search carried on by the commissary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, doctor,&rdquo; said Tripeaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, baron,&rdquo; resumed M. Baleinier, in a firm voice, &ldquo;that
      is my opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not mine, doctor,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;like M.
      Tripeaud, I considered it important to establish the fact by an entry in
      the report, and I saw, by the confused and troubled countenance of the
      magistrate, how painful it was to register the scandalous conduct of a
      young person placed in so high a position in society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne, losing patience, &ldquo;I
      believe your modesty to be about equal to that of this candid commissary
      of police; but it seems to me, that your mutual innocence was alarmed a
      little too soon. You might, and ought to have reflected, that there was
      nothing extraordinary in my coming home at eight o&rsquo;clock, if I had
      gone out at six.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The excuse, though somewhat tardy, is at least cunning,&rdquo; said
      the princess, spitefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not excuse myself, madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;but as
      M. Baleinier has been kind enough to speak a word in my favor, I give the
      possible interpretation of a fact, which it would not become me to explain
      in your presence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact will stand, however, in the report,&rdquo; said Tripeaud,
      &ldquo;until the explanation is given.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, his forehead resting on his hand, remained as if a
      stranger to this scene; he was too much occupied with his fears at the
      consequences of the approaching interview between Mdlle. de Cardoville and
      Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;for there seemed no possibility of
      using force to prevent Adrienne from going out that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Saint-Dizier went on: &ldquo;The fact which so greatly
      scandalized the commissary is nothing compared to what I yet have to tell
      you, gentlemen. We had searched all parts of the pavilion without finding
      any one, and were just about to quit the bed-chamber, for we had taken
      this room the last, when Mrs. Grivois pointed out to us that one of the
      golden mouldings of a panel did not appear to come quite home to the wall.
      We drew the attention of the magistrate to this circumstance; his men
      examined, touched, felt&mdash;the panel flew open!&mdash;and then&mdash;can
      you guess what we discovered? But, no! it is too odious, too revolting; I
      dare not even&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I dare, madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne, resolutely, though she
      saw with the utmost grief the retreat of Agricola was discovered; &ldquo;I
      will spare your highness&rsquo;s candor the recital of this new scandal,
      and yet what I am about to say is in nowise intended as a justification.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It requires one, however,&rdquo; said Madame de Saint-Dizier, with
      a disdainful smile; &ldquo;a man concealed by you in your own bedroom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man concealed in her bedroom!&rdquo; cried the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      raising his head with apparent indignation, which only covered a cruel
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man! in the bedroom of Mademoiselle!&rdquo; added Baron Tripeaud.
      &ldquo;I hope this also was inserted in the report.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, baron,&rdquo; said the princess with a triumphant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this man,&rdquo; said the doctor, in a hypocritical tone,
      &ldquo;must have been a robber? Any other supposition would be in the
      highest degree improbable. This explains itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your indulgence deceives you, M. Baleinier,&rdquo; answered the
      princess, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We knew the sort of thieves,&rdquo; said Tripeaud; &ldquo;they are
      generally young men, handsome, and very rich.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, sir,&rdquo; resumed Madame de Saint-Dizier. &ldquo;Mademoiselle
      does not raise her views so high. She proves that a dereliction from duty
      may be ignoble as well as criminal. I am no longer astonished at the
      sympathy which was just now professed for the lower orders. It is the more
      touching and affecting, as the man concealed by her was dressed in a
      blouse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blouse!&rdquo; cried the baron, with an air of extreme disgust;
      &ldquo;then he is one of the common people? It really makes one&rsquo;s
      hair stand on end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is a working smith&mdash;he confessed it,&rdquo; said the
      princess; &ldquo;but not to be unjust&mdash;he is really a good-looking
      fellow. It was doubtless that singular worship which Mademoiselle pays to
      the beautiful&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, madame, enough!&rdquo; said Adrienne suddenly, for,
      hitherto disdaining to answer, she had listened to her aunt with growing
      and painful indignation; &ldquo;I was just now on the point of defending
      myself against one of your odious insinuations&mdash;but I will not a
      second time descend to any such weakness. One word only, madame; has this
      honest and worthy artisan been arrested?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, he has been arrested and taken to prison, under a
      strong escort. Does not that pierce your heart?&rdquo; sneered the
      princess, with a triumphant air. &ldquo;Your tender pity for this
      interesting smith must indeed be very great, since it deprives you of your
      sarcastic assurance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; for I have something better to do than to satirize
      that which is utterly odious and ridiculous,&rdquo; replied Adrienne,
      whose eyes grew dim with tears at the thought of the cruel hurt to
      Agricola&rsquo;s family. Then, putting her hat on, and tying the strings,
      she said to the doctor: &ldquo;M. Baleinier, I asked you just now for your
      interest with the minister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; and it will give me great pleasure to act on your
      behalf.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your carriage below?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; said the doctor, much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be good enough to accompany me immediately to the minister&rsquo;s.
      Introduced by you, he will not refuse me the favor, or rather the act of
      justice, that I have to solicit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;do you dare
      take such a course, without my orders, after what has just passed? It is
      really quite unheard-of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It confounds one,&rdquo; added Tripeaud; &ldquo;but we must not be
      surprised at anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Adrienne asked the doctor if his carriage was below, D&rsquo;Aigrigny
      started. A look of intense satisfaction flashed across his countenance,
      and he could hardly repress the violence of his delight, when, darting, a
      rapid and significant glance at the doctor, he saw the latter respond to
      it by trace closing his eyelids in token of comprehension and assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When therefore the princess resumed, in an angry tone, addressing herself
      to Adrienne: &ldquo;Madame, I forbid you leaving the house!&rdquo;&mdash;D&rsquo;Aigrigny
      said to the speaker, with a peculiar inflection of the voice: &ldquo;I
      think, your highness, we may trust the lady to the doctor&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10389m.jpg" alt="10389m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10389.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The marquis pronounced these words in so significant a manner, that the
      princess, having looked by turns at the physician and D&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      understood it all, and her countenance grew radiant with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only did this pass with extreme rapidity, but the night was already
      almost come, so that Adrienne, absorbed in painful thoughts with regard to
      Agricola, did not perceive the different signals exchanged between the
      princess, the doctor, and the abbe. Even had she done so, they would have
      been incomprehensible to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not wishing to have the appearance of yielding too readily, to the
      suggestion of the marquis, Madame de Saint-Dizier resumed: &ldquo;Though
      the doctor seems to me to be far too indulgent to mademoiselle, I might
      not see any great objection to trusting her with him; but that I do not
      wish to establish such a precedent, for hence forward she must have no
      will but mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the physician gravely, feigning to be somewhat
      shocked by the words of the Princess de Saint-Dizier, &ldquo;I do not
      think I have been too indulgent to mademoiselle&mdash;but only just. I am
      at her orders, to take her to the minister if she wishes it. I do not know
      what she intends to solicit, but I believe her incapable of abusing the
      confidence I repose in her, or making me support a recommendation
      undeserved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, much moved, extended her hand cordially to the doctor, and said
      to him: &ldquo;Rest assured, my excellent friend, that you will thank me
      for the step I am taking, for you will assist in a noble action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tripeaud, who was not in the secret of the new plans of the doctor and the
      abbe in a low voice faltered to the latter, with a stupefied air, &ldquo;What!
      will you let her go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered D&rsquo;Aigrigny abruptly, making a sign
      that he should listen to the princess, who was about to speak. Advancing
      towards her niece, she said to her in a slow and measured tone, laying a
      peculiar emphasis on every word: &ldquo;One moment more, mademoiselle&mdash;one
      last word in presence of these gentlemen. Answer me! Notwithstanding the
      heavy charges impending over you, are you still determined to resist my
      formal commands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notwithstanding the scandalous exposure which has just taken place,
      you still persist in withdrawing yourself from my authority?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse positively to submit to the regular and decent mode of
      life which I would impose upon you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you, madame, that I am about to quit this
      dwelling in order to live alone and after my own fashion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your final decision?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my last word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect! the matter is serious. Beware!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given your highness my last word, and I never speak it
      twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, you hear all this?&rdquo; resumed the princess; &ldquo;I
      have tried in vain all that was possible to conciliate. Mademoiselle will
      have only herself to thank for the measures to which this audacious revolt
      will oblige me to have recourse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, madame,&rdquo; replied Adrienne. Then, addressing M.
      Baleinier, she said quickly to him: &ldquo;Come, my dear doctor; I am
      dying with impatience. Let us set out immediately. Every minute lost may
      occasion bitter tears to an honest family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Adrienne left the room precipitately with the physician. One of
      the servants called for M. Baleinier&rsquo;s carriage. Assisted by the
      doctor, Adrienne mounted the step, without perceiving that he said
      something in a low whisper to the footman that opened the coach-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, he was seated by the side of Mdlle. de Cardoville, and the
      door was closed upon them, he waited for about a second, and then called
      out in a loud voice to the coachman: &ldquo;To the house of the minister,
      by the private entrance!&rdquo; The horses started at a gallop.

      CHAPTER XLIII. A FALSE FRIEND.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ight had set in
      dark and cold. The sky, which had been clear till the sun went down, was
      now covered with gray and lurid clouds; a strong wind raised here and
      there, in circling eddies, the snow that was beginning to fall thick and
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamps threw a dubious light into the interior of Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s
      carriage, in which he was seated alone with Adrienne de Cardoville. The
      charming countenance of the latter, faintly illumined by the lamps beneath
      the shade of her little gray hat, looked doubly white and pure in contrast
      with the dark lining of the carriage, which was now filled with that,
      sweet, delicious, and almost voluptuous perfume which hangs about the
      garments of young women of taste. The attitude of the girl, seated next to
      the doctor, was full of grace. Her slight and elegant figure, imprisoned
      in her high-necked dress of blue cloth, imprinted its wavy outline on the
      soft cushion against which she leaned; her little feet, crossed one upon
      the other, and stretched rather forward, rested upon a thick bear-skin,
      which carpeted the bottom of the carriage. In her hand, which was ungloved
      and dazzlingly white, she held a magnificently embroidered handkerchief,
      with which, to the great astonishment of M. Baleinier, she dried her eyes,
      now filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; Adrienne wept, for she now felt the reaction from the painful scenes
      through which she had passed at Saint-Dizier House; to the feverish and
      nervous excitement, which had till then sustained her, had succeeded a
      sorrowful dejection. Resolute in her independence, proud in her disdain,
      implacable in her irony, audacious in her resistance to unjust oppression,
      Adrienne was yet endowed with the most acute sensibility, which she always
      dissembled, however, in the presence of her aunt and those who surrounded
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her courage, no one could have been less masculine, less
      of a virago, than Mdlle. Cardoville. She was essentially womanly, but as a
      woman, she knew how to exercise great empire over herself, the moment that
      the least mark of weakness on her part would have rejoiced or emboldened
      her enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage had rolled onwards for some minutes; but Adrienne, drying her
      tears in silence, to the doctor&rsquo;s great astonishment, had not yet
      uttered a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my dear Mdlle. Adrienne?&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, truly
      surprised at her emotion; &ldquo;what! you, that were just now so
      courageous, weeping?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, in an agitated voice; &ldquo;I weep
      in presence of a friend; but, before my aunt&mdash;oh! never.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, in that long interview, your stinging replies&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me! do you think that I resigned myself with pleasure to that
      war of sarcasm? Nothing is more painful to me than such combats of bitter
      irony, to which I am forced by the necessity of defending myself from this
      woman and her friends. You speak of my courage: it does not consist, I
      assure you, in the display of wicked feelings&mdash;but in the power to
      repress and hide all that I suffer, when I hear myself treated so grossly&mdash;in
      the presence, too, of people that I hate and despise&mdash;when, after
      all, I have never done them any harm, and have only asked to be allowed to
      live alone, freely and quietly, and see those about me happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it is: they envy your happiness, and that which
      you bestow upon others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is my aunt,&rdquo; cried Adrienne, with indignation, &ldquo;my
      aunt, whose whole life has been one long scandal that accuses me in this
      revolting manner!&mdash;as if she did not know me proud and honest enough
      never to make a choice of which I should be ashamed! Oh! if I ever love, I
      shall proclaim it, I shall be proud of it: for love, as I understand it,
      is the most glorious feeling in the world. But, alas!&rdquo; continued
      Adrienne, with redoubled bitterness, &ldquo;of what use are truth and
      honor, if they do not secure you from suspicions, which are as absurd as
      they are odious?&rdquo; So saying, she again pressed her handkerchief to
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear Mdlle. Adrienne,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, in a voice
      full of the softest unction, &ldquo;becalm&mdash;it is all over now. You
      have in me a devoted friend.&rdquo; As he pronounced these last words, he
      blushed in spite of his diabolical craft.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are my friend,&rdquo; said Adrienne: &ldquo;I shall
      never forget that, by taking my part to-day, you exposed yourself to the
      resentment of my aunt&mdash;for I am not ignorant of her power, which is
      very great, alas! for evil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; said the doctor, affecting a profound
      indifference, &ldquo;we medical men are pretty safe from personal
      enmities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my dear M. Baleinier! Mme. de Saint-Dizier and her friends
      never forgive,&rdquo; said the young girl, with a shudder. &ldquo;It
      needed all my invincible aversion, my innate horror for all that is base,
      cowardly, and perfidious, to induce me to break so openly with her. But if
      death itself were the penalty, I could not hesitate and yet,&rdquo; she
      added, with one of those graceful smiles which gave such a charm to her
      beautiful countenance, &ldquo;yet I am fond of life: if I have to reproach
      myself with anything, it is that I would have it too bright, too fair, too
      harmonious; but then, you know, I am resigned to my faults.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come, I am more tranquil,&rdquo; said the doctor, gayly;
      &ldquo;for you smile&mdash;that is a good sign.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is often the wisest course; and yet, ought I smile, after the
      threats that my aunt has held out to me? Still, what can she do? what is
      the meaning of this kind of family council? Did she seriously think that
      the advice of a M. D&rsquo;Aigrigny or a M. Tripeaud could have influenced
      me? And then she talked of rigorous measures. What measures can she take;
      do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, between ourselves, that the princess only wished to
      frighten you, and hopes to succeed by persuasion. She has the misfortune
      to fancy herself a mother of the Church, and dreams of your conversion,&rdquo;
      said the doctor, maliciously, for he now wished to tranquillize Adrienne
      at any cost; &ldquo;but let us think no more about it. Your fire eyes must
      shine with all their lustre, to fascinate the minister that we are going
      to see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, dear doctor; we ought always avoid grief, for it has
      the disadvantage of making us forget the sorrows of others. But here am I,
      availing myself of your kindness, without even telling you what I require.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily, we shall have plenty of time to talk over it, for our
      statesman lives at some distance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two words, here&rsquo;s the mystery,&rdquo; answered Adrienne.
      &ldquo;I told you what reasons I had to interest myself in that honest
      workman. This morning he came to me in great grief, to inform me that he
      was compromised by some songs he had written (for he is a poet), and that,
      though innocent, he was threatened with an arrest; and if they put him
      into prison, his family, whose sole support he is, would die of hunger.
      Therefore he came to beg me to procure bail for him, so that he might be
      left at liberty to work: I promised immediately, thinking of your interest
      with the minister; for, as they were already in pursuit of the poor lad, I
      chose to conceal him in my residence, and you know how my aunt has twisted
      that action. Now tell me, do you think, that, by means of your
      recommendation, the minister will grant me the freedom of this workman,
      bail being given for the same?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it. There will not be the shadow of a difficulty&mdash;especially
      when you have explained the facts to him, with that eloquence of the heart
      which you possess in perfection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear Dr. Baleinier, why I have taken the resolution
      (which is perhaps a strange one) to ask you to accompany me to the
      minister&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, doubtless, to recommend your friend in a more effective
      manner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but also to put an end, by a decisive step, to the
      calumnies which my aunt will be sure to spread with regard to me, and
      which she has already, you know, had inserted in the report of the
      commissary of police. I have preferred to address myself at once, frankly
      and openly, to a man placed in a high social position. I will explain all
      to him, who will believe me, because truth has an accent of its own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this, my dear Mdlle. Adrienne, is wisely planned. You will, as
      the saw says, kill two birds with one stone&mdash;or rather, you will
      obtain by one act of kindness two acts of justice; you will destroy a
      dangerous calumny, and restore a worthy youth to liberty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Adrienne, laughing, &ldquo;thanks to this
      pleasing prospect, my light heart has returned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How true that in life,&rdquo; said the doctor, philosophically,
      &ldquo;everything depends on the point of view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne was so completely ignorant of the forms of a constitutional
      government, and had so blind a confidence in the doctor, that she did not
      doubt for an instant what he told her. She therefore resumed with joy:
      &ldquo;What happiness it will be! when I go to fetch the daughters of
      Marshal Simon, to be able to console this workman&rsquo;s mother, who is
      now perhaps in a state of cruel anxiety, at not seeing her son return
      home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will have this pleasure,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, with a
      smile; &ldquo;for we will solicit and intrigue to such purpose, that the
      good, mother may learn from you the release of her son before she even
      knows that he has been arrested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind, how obliging you are!&rdquo; said Adrienne. &ldquo;Really,
      if the motive were not so serious, I should be ashamed of making you lose
      so much precious time, my dear M. Baleinier. But I know your heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no other wish, than to prove to you my profound devotion, my
      sincere attachment,&rdquo; said the doctor inhaling a pinch of snuff. But
      at the same time, he cast an uneasy glance through the window, for the
      carriage was just crossing the Place de l&rsquo;Odeon, and in spite of the
      snow, he could see the front of the Odeon theatre brilliantly illuminated.
      Now Adrienne, who had just turned her head towards that side, might
      perhaps be astonished at the singular road they were taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to draw off her attention by a skillful diversion, the doctor
      exclaimed suddenly: &ldquo;Bless me! I had almost forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, M. Baleinier?&rdquo; said Adrienne, turning
      hastily towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten a thing of the highest importance, in regard to the
      success of our petition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, please?&rdquo; asked the young girl, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Baleinier gave a cunning smile. &ldquo;Every man,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;has his weakness&mdash;ministers even more than others. The one we
      are going to visit has the folly to attach the utmost importance to his
      title, and the first impression would be unfavorable, if you did not lay
      great stress on the Minister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all, my dear M. Baleinier?&rdquo; said Adrienne, smiling in
      her turn. &ldquo;I will even go so far as Your Excellency, which is, I
      believe, one of his adopted titles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now&mdash;but that is no matter; if you could even slide in a
      My Lord or two, our business would be done at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied! since there are upstart ministers as well as
      City-turned gentlemen, I will remember Moliere&rsquo;s M. Jourdain, and
      feed full the gluttonous vanity of your friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give him up to you, for I know he will be in good hands,&rdquo;
      replied the physician, who rejoiced to see that the carriage had now
      entered those dark streets which lead from the Place de l&rsquo;Odeon to
      the Pantheon district; &ldquo;I do not wish to find fault with the
      minister for being proud, since his pride may be of service to us on this
      occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These petty devices are innocent enough,&rdquo; said Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, &ldquo;and I confess that I do not scruple to have recourse to
      them.&rdquo; Then, leaning towards the door-sash, she added: &ldquo;Gracious!
      how sad and dark are these streets. What wind! what snow! In which quarter
      are we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you so ungrateful, that you do not recognize by the
      absence of shops, your dear quarter of the Faubourg Saint Germain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine we had quitted it long ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so too,&rdquo; said the physician, leaning forward as if
      to ascertain where they were, &ldquo;but we are still there. My poor
      coachman, blinded by the snow, which is beating against his face, must
      have gone wrong just now&mdash;but we are all right again. Yes, I perceive
      we are in the Rue Saint Guillaume&mdash;not the gayest of streets by the
      way&mdash;but, in ten minutes, we shall arrive at the minister&rsquo;s
      private entrance, for intimate friends like myself enjoy the privilege of
      escaping the honors of a grand reception.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, like most carriage-people, was so little acquainted
      with certain streets of Paris, as well as with the customs of men in
      office, that she did not doubt for a moment the statements of Baleinier,
      in whom she reposed the utmost confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they left the Saint-Dizier House, the doctor had upon his lips a
      question which he hesitated to put, for fear of endangering himself in the
      eyes of Adrienne. The latter had spoken of important interests, the
      existence of which had been concealed from her. The doctor, who was an
      acute and skillful observer, had quite clearly remarked the embarrassment
      and anxiety of the princess and D&rsquo;Aigrigny. He no longer doubted,
      that the plot directed against Adrienne&mdash;one in which he was the
      blind agent, in submission to the will of the Order&mdash;related to
      interests which had been concealed from him, and which, for that very
      reason, he burned to discover; for every member of the dark conspiracy to
      which he belonged had necessarily acquired the odious vices inherent to
      spies and informers&mdash;envy, suspicion, and jealous curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to understand, therefore, that Dr. Baleinier, though quite
      determined to serve the projects of D&rsquo;Aigrigny, was yet very anxious
      to learn what had been kept from him. Conquering his irresolution, and
      finding the opportunity favorable, and no time to be lost, he said to
      Adrienne, after a moment&rsquo;s silence: &ldquo;I am going perhaps to ask
      you a very indiscreet question. If you think it such, pray do not answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay&mdash;go on, I entreat you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now&mdash;a few minutes before the arrival of the commissary
      of police was announced to your aunt&mdash;you spoke, I think, of some
      great interests, which had hitherto been concealed from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These words,&rdquo; continued M. Baleinier, speaking slowly and
      emphatically, &ldquo;appeared to make a deep impression on the princess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An impression so deep,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;that sundry
      suspicions of mine were changed to certainty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not tell you, my charming friend,&rdquo; resumed M.
      Baleinier, in a bland tone, &ldquo;that if I remind you of this
      circumstance, it is only to offer you my services, in case they should be
      required. If not&mdash;and there is the shadow of impropriety in letting
      me know more&mdash;forget that I have said a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne became serious and pensive, and, after a silence of some moments,
      she thus answered Dr. Baleinier: &ldquo;On this subject, there are some
      things that I do not know&mdash;others that I may tell you&mdash;others
      again that I must keep from you: but you are so kind to-day, that I am
      happy to be able to give you a new mark of confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wish to know nothing,&rdquo; said the doctor, with an air of
      humble deprecation, &ldquo;for I should have the appearance of accepting a
      kind of reward; whilst I am paid a thousand times over, by the pleasure I
      feel in serving you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Adrienne, without attending to the delicate
      scruples of Dr. Baleinier; &ldquo;I have powerful reasons for believing
      that an immense inheritance must, at no very distant period, be divided
      between the members of my family, all of whom I do not know&mdash;for,
      after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, those from whom we are
      descended were dispersed in foreign countries, and experienced a great
      variety of fortunes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried the doctor, becoming extremely interested.
      &ldquo;Where is this inheritance, in whose hands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now how will you assert your rights?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall learn soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will inform you of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I may not tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you find out the existence of this inheritance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also I may not tell you,&rdquo; returned Adrienne, in a soft
      and melancholy tone, which remarkably contrasted with the habitual
      vivacity of her conversation. &ldquo;It is a secret&mdash;a strange secret&mdash;and
      in those moments of excitement, in which you have sometimes surprised me,
      I have been thinking of extraordinary circumstances connected with this
      secret, which awakened within me lofty and magnificent ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne paused and was silent, absorbed in her own reflections. Baleinier
      did not seek to disturb her. In the first place, Mdlle. de Cardoville did
      not perceive the direction the coach was taking; secondly, the doctor was
      not sorry to ponder over what he had just heard. With his usual
      perspicuity, he saw that the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny was concerned in this
      inheritance, and he resolved instantly to make a secret report on the
      subject; either M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny was acting under the instructions of
      the Order, or by his own impulse; in the one event, the report of the
      doctor would confirm a fact; in the other, it would reveal one.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time, therefore, the lady and Dr. Baleinier remained perfectly
      silent, no longer even disturbed by the noise of the wheels, for the
      carriage now rolled over a thick carpet of snow, and the streets had
      become more and more deserted. Notwithstanding his crafty treachery,
      notwithstanding his audacity and the blindness of his dupe, the doctor was
      not quite tranquil as to the result of his machinations. The critical
      moment approached, and the least suspicion roused in the mind of Adrienne
      by any inadvertence on his part, might ruin all his projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, already fatigued by the painful emotions of the day, shuddered
      from time to time, as the cold became more and more piercing; in her haste
      to accompany Dr. Baleinier, she had neglected to take either shawl or
      mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes the coach had followed the line of a very high wall,
      which, seen through the snow, looked white against a black sky. The
      silence was deep and mournful. Suddenly the carriage stopped, and the
      footman went to knock at a large gateway; he first gave two rapid knocks,
      and then one other at a long interval. Adrienne did not notice the
      circumstance, for the noise was not loud, and the doctor had immediately
      begun to speak, to drown with his voice this species of signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are at last,&rdquo; said he gayly to Adrienne; &ldquo;you
      must be very winning&mdash;that is, you must be yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure I will do my best,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, with a smile;
      then she added, shivering in spite of herself: &ldquo;How dreadfully cold
      it is! I must confess, my dear Dr. Baleinier, that when I have been to
      fetch my poor little relations from the house of our workman&rsquo;s
      mother, I shall be truly glad to find myself once more in the warmth and
      light of my own cheerful rooms, for you know my aversion to cold and
      darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite natural,&rdquo; said the doctor, gallantly; &ldquo;the
      most charming flowers require the most light and heat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the doctor and Mdlle. de Cardoville exchanged these few words, a
      heavy gate had turned creaking upon its hinges, and the carriage had
      entered a court-yard. The physician got down first, to offer his arm to
      Adrienne.

      CHAPTER XLIV. THE MINISTER&rsquo;S CABINET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he carriage had
      stopped before some steps covered with snow, which led to a vestibule
      lighted by a lamp. The better to ascend the steps, which were somewhat
      slippery, Adrienne leaned upon the doctor&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! how you tremble,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied she, shuddering, &ldquo;I feel deadly cold. In
      my haste, I came out without a shawl. But how gloomy this house appears,&rdquo;
      she added, pointing to the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what you call the minister&rsquo;s private house, the sanctum
      sanctorum, whither our statesman retires far from the sound of the
      profane,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, with a smile. &ldquo;Pray come in!&rdquo;
      and he pushed open the door of a large hall, completely empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are right in saying,&rdquo; resumed Dr. Baleinier, who covered
      his secret agitation with an appearance of gayety, &ldquo;that a minister&rsquo;s
      house is like nobody else&rsquo;s. Not a footman&mdash;not a page, I
      should say&mdash;to be found in the antechamber. Luckily,&rdquo; added he,
      opening the door of a room which communicated with the vestibule,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In this seraglio reared, I know the secret ways.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville was now introduced into an apartment hung with green
      embossed paper, and very simply furnished with mahogany chairs, covered
      with yellow velvet; the floor was carefully polished, and a globe lamp,
      which gave at most a third of its proper light, was suspended (at a much
      greater height than usual) from the ceiling. Finding the appearance of
      this habitation singularly plain for the dwelling of a minister, Adrienne,
      though she had no suspicion, could not suppress a movement of surprise and
      paused a moment on the threshold of the door. M. Baleinier, by whose arm
      she held, guessed the cause of her astonishment, and said to her with a
      smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This place appears to you very paltry for &lsquo;his excellency,&rsquo;
      does it not? If you knew what a thing constitutional economy is!&mdash;Moreover,
      you will see a &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo; who has almost as little pretension
      as his furniture. But please to wait for me an instant. I will go and
      inform the minister you are here, and return immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently disengaging himself from the grasp of Adrienne, who had
      involuntarily pressed close to him, the physician opened a small side
      door, by which he instantly disappeared. Adrienne de Cardoville was left
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she could not have explained the cause of her impression, there was
      something awe-inspiring to the young lady in this large, cold, naked,
      curtainless room; and as, by degrees, she noticed certain peculiarities in
      the furniture, which she had not at first perceived, she was seized with
      an indefinable feeling of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the cheerless hearth, she perceived with surprise that an iron
      grating completely enclosed the opening of the chimney, and that the tongs
      and shovel were fastened with iron chains. Already astonished by this
      singularity, she was about mechanically to draw towards her an armchair
      placed against the wall, when she found that it remained motionless. She
      then discovered that the back of this piece of furniture, as well as that
      of all the other chairs, was fastened to the wainscoting by iron clamps.
      Unable to repress a smile, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Have they so little
      confidence in the statesman in whose house I am, that they are obliged to
      fasten the furniture to the walls?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne had recourse to this somewhat forced pleasantry as a kind of
      effort to resist the painful feeling of apprehension that was gradually
      creeping over her; for the most profound and mournful silence reigned in
      this habitation, where nothing indicated the life, the movement and the
      activity, which usually surround a great centre of business. Only, from
      time to time, the young lady heard the violent gusts of wind from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and M. Baleinier did not
      return. In her impatient anxiety, Adrienne wished to call some one to
      inquire about the doctor and the minister. She raised her eyes to look for
      a bell-rope by the side of the chimney-glass; she found none, but she
      perceived, that what she had hitherto taken for a glass, thanks to the
      half obscurity of the room, was in reality a large sheet of shining tin.
      Drawing nearer to it, she accidentally touched a bronzed candlestick; and
      this, as well as a clock, was fixed to the marble of the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain dispositions of mind, the most insignificant circumstances
      often assume terrific proportions. This immovable candlestick, this
      furniture fastened to the wainscot, this glass replaced by a tin sheet,
      this profound silence, and the prolonged absence of M. Baleinier, had such
      an effect upon Adrienne, that she was struck with a vague terror. Yet such
      was her implicit confidence in the doctor, that she reproached herself
      with her own fears, persuading herself that the causes of them were after
      all of no real importance, and that it was unreasonable to feel uneasy at
      such trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though she thus strove to regain courage, her anxiety induced her
      to do what otherwise she would never have attempted. She approached the
      little door by which the doctor had disappeared, and applied her ear to
      it. She held her breath, and listened, but heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a dull, heavy sound, like that of a falling body, was audible
      just above her head; she thought she could even distinguish a stifled
      moaning. Raising her eyes, hastily, she saw some particles of the plaster
      fall from the ceiling, loosened, no doubt, by the shaking of the floor
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer able to resist the feeling of terror, Adrienne ran to the door
      by which she had entered with the doctor, in order to call some one. To
      her great surprise, she found it was fastened on the outside. Yet, since
      her arrival, she had heard no sound of a key turning in the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more alarmed, the young girl flew to the little door by which the
      physician had disappeared, and at which she had just been listening. This
      door also was fastened on the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, wishing to struggle with the terror which was gaining invincibly
      upon her, Adrienne called to her aid all the firmness of her character,
      and tried to argue away her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have been deceived.&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it was only a
      fall that I heard. The moaning had no existence, except in my imagination.
      There are a thousand reasons for believing that it was not a person who
      fell down. But, then, these locked doors? They, perhaps, do not know that
      I am here; they may have thought that there was nobody in this room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered these words, Adrienne looked round with anxiety; then she
      added, in a firm voice: &ldquo;No weakness! it is useless to try to blind
      myself to my real situation. On the contrary, I must look it well in the
      face. It is evident that I am not here at a minister&rsquo;s house; no end
      of reasons prove it beyond a doubt; M. Baleinier has therefore deceived
      me. But for what end? Why has he brought me hither? Where am I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two questions appeared to Adrienne both equally insoluble. It
      only remained clear, that she was the victim of M. Baleinier&rsquo;s
      perfidy. But this certainly seemed so horrible to the young girl&rsquo;s
      truthful and generous soul, that she still tried to combat the idea by the
      recollection of the confiding friendship which she had always shown this
      man. She said to herself with bitterness: &ldquo;See how weakness and fear
      may lead one to unjust and odious suspicions! Yes; for until the last
      extremity, it is not justifiable to believe in so infernal a deception&mdash;and
      then only upon the clearest evidence. I will call some one: it is the only
      way of completely satisfying these doubts.&rdquo; Then, remembering that
      there was no bell, she added: &ldquo;No matter; I will knock, and some one
      will doubtless answer.&rdquo; With her little, delicate hand, Adrienne
      struck the door several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull, heavy sound which came from the door showed that it was very
      thick. No answer was returned to the young girl. She ran to the other
      door. There was the same appeal on her part, the same profound silence
      without&mdash;only interrupted from time to time by the howling of the
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not more timid than other people,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      shuddering; &ldquo;I do not know if it is the excessive cold, but I
      tremble in spite of myself. I endeavor to guard against all weakness; yet
      I think that any one in my position would find all this very strange and
      frightful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, loud cries, or rather savage and dreadful howls, burst
      furiously from the room just above, and soon after a sort of stamping of
      feet, like the noise of a violent struggle, shook the ceiling of the
      apartment. Struck with consternation, Adrienne uttered a loud cry of
      terror became deadly pale, stood for a moment motionless with affright,
      and then rushed to one of the windows, and abruptly threw it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent gust of wind, mixed with melted snow, beat against Adrienne&rsquo;s
      face, swept roughly into the room, and soon extinguished the flickering
      and smoky light of the lamp. Thus, plunged in profound darkness, with her
      hands clinging to the bars that were placed across the window, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville yielded at length to the full influence of her fears, so long
      restrained, and was about to call aloud for help, when an unexpected
      apparition rendered her for some minutes absolutely mute with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wing of the building, opposite to that in which she was, stood at
      no great distance. Through the midst of the black darkness, which filled
      the space between, one large, lighted window was distinctly visible.
      Through the curtainless panes, Adrienne perceived a white figure, gaunt
      and ghastly, dragging after it a sort of shroud, and passing and repassing
      continually before the window, with an abrupt and restless motion. Her
      eyes fixed upon this window, shining through the darkness, Adrienne
      remained as if fascinated by that fatal vision: and, as the spectacle
      filled up the measure of her fears, she called for help with all her
      might, without quitting the bars of the window to which she clung. After a
      few seconds, whilst she was thus crying out, two tall women entered the
      room in silence, unperceived by Mdlle. de Cardoville, who was still
      clinging to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      These women, of about forty to fifty years of age, robust and masculine,
      were negligently and shabbily dressed, like chambermaids of the lower
      sort; over their clothes they wore large aprons of blue cotton, cut
      sloping from their necks, and reaching down to their feet. One of them,
      who held a lamp in her hand, had a broad, red, shining face, a large
      pimpled nose, small green eyes, and tow hair, which straggled rough and
      shaggy from beneath her dirty white cap. The other, sallow, withered, and
      bony, wore a mourning-cap over a parchment visage, pitted with the
      small-pox, and rendered still more repulsive by the thick black eyebrows,
      and some long gray hairs that overshadowed the upper lip. This woman
      carried, half unfolded in her hand, a garment of strange form, made of
      thick gray stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both entered silently by the little door, at the moment when
      Adrienne, in the excess of her terror, was grasping the bars of the
      window, and crying out: &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pointing out the young lady to each other, one of them went to place the
      lamp on the chimney-piece, whilst the other (she who wore the mourning
      cap) approached the window, and laid her great bony hand upon Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning round, Adrienne uttered a new cry of terror at the sight of this
      grim figure. Then, the first moment of stupor over, she began to feel less
      afraid; hideous as was this woman, it was at least some one to speak to;
      she exclaimed, therefore, in an agitated voice: &ldquo;Where is M.
      Baleinier?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women looked at each other, exchanged a leer of mutual
      intelligence, but did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you, madame,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, &ldquo;where is M.
      Baleinier, who brought me hither? I wish to see him instantly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; said the big woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; cried Adrienne; &ldquo;gone without me!&mdash;Gracious
      heaven! what can be the meaning of all this?&rdquo; Then, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, she resumed, &ldquo;Please to fetch me a coach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women looked at each other, and shrugged their shoulders. &ldquo;I
      entreat you, madame,&rdquo; continued Adrienne, with forced calmness in
      her voice, &ldquo;to fetch me a coach since M. Baleinier is gone without
      me. I wish to leave this place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, madame,&rdquo; said the tall woman, who was called
      &ldquo;Tomboy,&rdquo; without appearing to listen to what Adrienne asked,
      &ldquo;it is time for you to go to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go to bed!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. Cardoville, in alarm. &ldquo;This
      is really enough to drive one mad.&rdquo; Then, addressing the two women,
      she added: &ldquo;What is this house? where am I? answer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in a house,&rdquo; said Tomboy, in a rough voice, &ldquo;where
      you must not make a row from the window, as you did just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where you must not put out the lamp as you have done,&rdquo;
      added the other woman, who was called Gervaise, &ldquo;or else we shall
      have a crow to pick with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, unable to utter a word, and trembling with fear, looked in a
      kind of stupor from one to the other of these horrible women; her reason
      strove in vain to comprehend what was passing around her. Suddenly she
      thought she had guessed it, and exclaimed: &ldquo;I see there is a mistake
      here. I do not understand how, but there is a mistake. You take me for
      some one else. Do you know who I am? My name is Adrienne de Cardoville You
      see, therefore, that I am at liberty to leave this house; no one in the
      world has the right to detain me. I command you, then, to fetch me a coach
      immediately. If there are none in this quarter, let me have some one to
      accompany me home to the Rue de Babylone, Saint-Dizier House. I will
      reward such a person liberally, and you also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you finished?&rdquo; said Tomboy. &ldquo;What is the use
      of telling us all this rubbish?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, who wished to try every means;
      &ldquo;if you detain me here by force, it will be very serious. You do not
      know to what you expose yourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to bed; yes or no?&rdquo; said Gervaise, in a tone of
      harsh impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, madame,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, precipitately,
      &ldquo;let me out this place, and I will give each of you two thousand
      francs. It is not enough? I will give you ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;whatever
      you ask. I am rich&mdash;only let me out for heaven&rsquo;s sake, let me
      out!&mdash;I cannot remain here&mdash;I am afraid.&rdquo; As she said
      this, the tone of the poor girl&rsquo;s voice was heartrending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand francs!&mdash;that&rsquo;s the usual figure, ain&rsquo;t
      it, Tomboy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let be, Gervaise! they all sing the same song.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then? since reasons, prayers, and menaces are all in vain,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne gathering energy from her desperate position, &ldquo;I
      declare to you that I will go out and that instantly. We will see if you
      are bold enough to employ force against me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Adrienne advanced resolutely towards the door. But, at this
      moment, the wild hoarse cries, which had preceded the noise of the
      struggle that had so frightened her, again resounded; only, this time they
      were not accompanied by the movement of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what screams!&rdquo; said Adrienne, stopping short, and in her
      terror drawing nigh to the two women. &ldquo;Do you not hear those cries?
      What, then, is this house, in which one hears such things? And over there,
      too,&rdquo; added she almost beside herself, as she pointed to the other
      wing where the lighted windows shone through the darkness, and the white
      figure continued to pass and repass before it; &ldquo;over there! do you
      see? What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that &lsquo;un,&rdquo; said Tomboy; &ldquo;one of the folks
      who, like you, have not behaved well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, clasping her
      hands in terror. &ldquo;Heavens! what is this house? What do they do to
      them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will be done to you, if you are naughty, and refuse to come to
      bed,&rdquo; answered Gervaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They put this on them,&rdquo; said Tomboy, showing the garment that
      she had held under her arm, &ldquo;they clap &lsquo;em into the
      strait-waistcoast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Adrienne, hiding her face in her hands with
      horror. A terrible discovery had flashed suddenly upon her. She understood
      it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capping the violent emotions of the day, the effect of this last blow was
      dreadful. The young girl felt her strength give way. Her hands fell
      powerless, her face became fearfully pale, all her limbs trembled, and
      sinking upon her knees, and casting a terrified glance at the strait
      waistcoat she was just able to falter in a feeble voice, &ldquo;Oh, no:&mdash;not
      that&mdash;for pity&rsquo;s sake, madame. I will do&mdash;whatever you
      wish.&rdquo; And, her strength quite failing, she would have fallen upon
      the ground if the two women had not run towards her, and received her
      fainting into their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fainting fit,&rdquo; said Tomboy; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not
      dangerous. Let us carry her to bed. We can undress her, and this will be
      all nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry her, then,&rdquo; said Gervaise. &ldquo;I will take the lamp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall and robust Tomboy took up Mdlle. de Cardoville as if she had been
      a sleeping child, carried her in her arms, and followed her companion into
      the chamber through which M. Baleinier had made his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chamber, though perfectly clean, was cold and bare. A greenish paper
      covered the walls, and a low, little iron bedstead, the head of which
      formed a kind of shelf, stood in one corner; a stove, fixed in the
      chimney-place, was surrounded by an iron grating, which forbade a near
      approach; a table fastened to the wall, a chair placed before this table,
      and also clamped to the floor, a mahogany chest of drawers, and a rush
      bottomed armchair completed the scanty furniture. The curtainless window
      was furnished on the inside with an iron grating, which served to protect
      the panes from being broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was into this gloomy retreat, which formed so painful a contrast with
      the charming little summer-house in the Rue de Babylone, that Adrienne was
      carried by Tomboy, who, with the assistance of Gervaise, placed the
      inanimate form on the bed. The lamp was deposited on the shelf at the head
      of the couch. Whilst one of the nurses held her up, the other unfastened
      and took off the cloth dress of the young girl, whose head drooped
      languidly on her bosom. Though in a swoon, large tears trickled slowly
      from her closed eyes, whose long black lashes threw their shadows on the
      transparent whiteness of her cheeks. Over her neck and breast of ivory
      flowed the golden waves of her magnificent hair, which had come down at
      the time of her fall. When, as they unlaced her satin corset, less soft,
      less fresh, less white than the virgin form beneath, which lay like a
      statue of alabaster in its covering of lace and lawn, one of the horrible
      hags felt the arms and shoulders of the young girl with her large, red,
      horny, and chapped hands. Though she did not completely recover the use of
      her senses, she started involuntarily from the rude and brutal touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she little feet?&rdquo; said the nurse, who, kneeling
      down, was employed in drawing off Adrienne&rsquo;s stockings. &ldquo;I
      could hold them both in the hollow of my hand.&rdquo; In fact, a small,
      rosy foot, smooth as a child&rsquo;s, here and there veined with azure,
      was soon exposed to view, as was also a leg with pink knee and ankle, of
      as pure and exquisite a form as that of Diana Huntress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what hair!&rdquo; said Tomboy; &ldquo;so long and soft!&mdash;She
      might almost walk upon it. &lsquo;Twould be a pity to cut it off, to put
      ice upon her skull!&rdquo; As she spoke, she gathered up Adrienne&rsquo;s
      magnificent hair, and twisted it as well as she could behind her head.
      Alas! it was no longer the fair, light hand of Georgette, Florine, or Hebe
      that arranged the beauteous locks of their mistress with so much love and
      pride!
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she again felt the rude touch of the nurse&rsquo;s hand, the young
      girl was once more seized with the same nervous trembling, only more
      frequently and strongly than before. And soon, whether by a sort of
      instinctive repulsion, magnetically excited during her swoon, or from the
      effect of the cold night air, Adrienne again started and slowly came to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe her alarm, horror, and chaste indignation,
      as, thrusting aside with both her hands the numerous curls that covered
      her face, bathed in tears, she saw herself half-naked between these filthy
      hags. At first, she uttered a cry of shame and terror; then to escape from
      the looks of the women, by a movement, rapid as thought, she drew down the
      lamp placed on the shelf at the head of her bed, so that it was
      extinguished and broken to pieces on the floor. After which, in the midst
      of the darkness, the unfortunate girl, covering herself with the
      bed-clothes, burst into passionate sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurses attributed Adrienne&rsquo;s cry and violent actions to a fit of
      furious madness. &ldquo;Oh! you begin again to break the lamps&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      your partickler fancy, is it?&rdquo; cried Tomboy, angrily, as she felt
      her way in the dark. &ldquo;Well! I gave you fair warning. You shall have
      the strait waistcoat on this very night, like the mad gal upstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;hold her fast,
      Tommy, while I go and fetch a light. Between us, we&rsquo;ll soon master
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, for, in spite of her soft look, she must be a regular
      fury. We shall have to sit up all night with her, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad and painful contrast! That morning, Adrienne had risen free, smiling,
      happy, in the midst of all the wonders of luxury and art, and surrounded
      by the delicate attentions of the three charming girls whom she had chosen
      to serve her. In her generous and fantastic mood, she had prepared a
      magnificent and fairy-like surprise for the young Indian prince, her
      relation; she had also taken a noble resolution with regard to the two
      orphans brought home by Dagobert; in her interview with Mme. de
      Saint-Dizier, she had shown herself by turns proud and sensitive,
      melancholy and gay, ironical and serious, loyal and courageous; finally,
      she had come to this accursed house to plead in favor of an honest and
      laborious artisan.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in the evening delivered over by an atrocious piece of treachery
      to the ignoble hands of two coarse-minded muses in a madhouse&mdash;Mdlle.
      de Cardoville felt her delicate limbs imprisoned in that abominable
      garment, which is called a strait-waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville passed a horrible night in company with the two hags.
      The next morning, at nine o&rsquo;clock, what was the young lady&rsquo;s
      stupor to see Dr. Baleinier enter the room, still smiling with an air at
      once benevolent and paternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear child?&rdquo; said he, in a bland, affectionate
      voice; &ldquo;how have we spent the night?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      The keepers, yielding to Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s prayers, and, above
      all, to her promises of good behavior, had only left on the canvas jacket
      a portion of the time. Towards morning, they had allowed her to rise and
      dress herself, without interfering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne was seated on the edge of her bed. The alteration in her
      features, her dreadful paleness, the lurid fire of fever shining in her
      eyes, the convulsive trembling which ever and anon shook her frame, showed
      already the fatal effects of this terrible night upon a susceptible and
      high-strung organization. At sight of Dr. Baleinier, who, with a sign,
      made Gervaise and her mate leave the room, Adrienne remained petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt a kind of giddiness at the thought of the audacity of the man,
      who dared to present himself to her! But when the physician repeated, in
      the softest tone of affectionate interest: &ldquo;Well, my poor child! how
      have we spent the night?&rdquo; she pressed her hands to her burning
      forehead, as if in doubt whether she was awake or sleeping. Then, staring
      at the doctor, she half opened her lips; but they trembled so much that it
      was impossible for her to utter a word. Anger, indignation, contempt, and,
      above all, the bitter and acutely painful feeling of a generous heart,
      whose confidence has been basely betrayed, so overpowered Adrienne that
      she was unable to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! I see how it is,&rdquo; said the doctor, shaking his
      head sorrowfully; &ldquo;you are very much displeased with me&mdash;is it
      not so? Well! I expected it, my dear child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, pronounced with the most hypocritical effrontery, made
      Adrienne start up. Her pale cheek flushed, her large eyes sparkled, she
      lifted proudly her beautiful head, whilst her upper lip curled slightly
      with a smile of disdainful bitterness; then, passing in angry silence
      before M. Baleinier, who retained his seat, she directed her swift and
      firm steps towards the door. This door, in which was a little wicket, was
      fastened on the outside. Adrienne turned towards the doctor, and said to
      him, with an imperious gesture; &ldquo;Open that door for me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear Mdlle. Adrienne,&rdquo; said the physician, &ldquo;be
      calm. Let us talk like good friends&mdash;for you know I am your friend.&rdquo;
      And he inhaled slowly a pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, in a voice trembling with
      indignation, &ldquo;I am not to leave this place to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! no. In such a state of excitement&mdash;if you knew how
      inflamed your face is, and your eyes so feverish, your pulse must be at
      least eighty to the minute&mdash;I conjure you, my dear child, not to
      aggravate your symptoms by this fatal agitation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After looking fixedly at the doctor, Adrienne returned with a slow step,
      and again took her seat on the edge of the bed. &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo;
      resumed M. Baleinier: &ldquo;only be reasonable; and, as I said before,
      let us talk together like good friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say well, sir,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, in a collected and
      perfectly calm voice; &ldquo;let us talk like friends. You wish to make me
      pass for mad&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, my dear child, that one day you may feel towards me as much
      gratitude as you now do aversion. The latter I had fully foreseen&mdash;but,
      however painful may be the performance of certain duties, we must resign
      ourselves to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Baleinier sighed, as he said this, with such a natural air of
      conviction, that for a moment Adrienne could not repress a movement of
      surprise; then, while her lip curled with a bitter laugh, she answered:
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s very clear, you have done all this for my good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear young lady&mdash;have I ever had any other design
      than to be useful to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, sir, if your impudence be not still more odious than
      your cowardly treachery!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, shrugging his shoulders with a
      grieved air; &ldquo;treachery, indeed! Only reflect, my poor child&mdash;do
      you think, if I were not acting with good faith, conscientiously, in your
      interest, I should return this morning to meet your indignation, for which
      I was fully prepared? I am the head physician of this asylum, which
      belongs to me&mdash;but I have two of my pupils here, doctors, like myself&mdash;and
      might have left them to take care of you but, no&mdash;I could not consent
      to it&mdash;I knew your character, your nature, your previous history, and
      (leaving out of the question the interest I feel for you) I can treat your
      case better than any one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne had heard M. Baleinier without interrupting him; she now looked
      at him fixedly, and said: &ldquo;Pray, sir, how much do they pay you to
      make me pass for mad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; cried M. Baleinier, who felt stung in spite of,
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am rich,&rdquo; continued Adrienne, with overwhelming
      disdain; &ldquo;I will double the sum that they give you. Come, sir&mdash;in
      the name of friendship, as you call it, let me have the pleasure of
      outbidding them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your keepers,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, recovering all his
      coolness, &ldquo;have informed me, in their report of the night&rsquo;s
      proceedings, that you made similar propositions to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir; I offered them what might be acceptable to poor
      women, without education, whom misfortune has forced to undertake a
      painful employment&mdash;but to you, sir a man of the world, a man of
      science, a man of great abilities&mdash;that is quite different&mdash;the
      pay must be a great deal higher. There is treachery at all prices; so do
      not found your refusal on the smallness of my offer to those wretched
      women. Tell me&mdash;how much do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your keepers, in their report of the night, have also spoken of
      threats,&rdquo; resumed M. Baleinier, with the same coolness; &ldquo;have
      you any of those likewise to address me? Believe me, my poor child, you
      will do well to exhaust at once your attempts at corruption, and your vain
      threats of vengeance. We shall then come to the true state of the case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you deem my threats vain!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, at
      length giving way to the full tide of her indignation, till then
      restrained. &ldquo;Do you think, sir, that when I leave this place&mdash;for
      this outrage must have an end&mdash;that I will not proclaim aloud your
      infamous treachery? Do you think chat I will not denounce to the contempt
      and horror of all, your base conspiracy with Madame de Saint-Dizier? Oh!
      do you think that I will conceal the frightful treatment I have received!
      But, mad as I may be, I know that there are laws in this country, by which
      I will demand a full reparation for myself, and shame, disgrace, and
      punishment, for you, and for those who have employed you! Henceforth,
      between you and me will be hate and war to the death; and all my strength,
      all my intelligence&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to interrupt you, my dear Mdlle. Adrienne,&rdquo; said
      the doctor, still perfectly calm and affectionate: &ldquo;nothing can be
      more unfavorable to your cure, than to cherish idle hopes: they will only
      tend to keep up a state of deplorable excitement: it is best to put the
      facts fairly before you, that you may understand clearly your position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1. It is impossible for you to leave this house. 2. You can have no
      communication with any one beyond its walls. 3. No one enters here that I
      cannot perfectly depend upon. 4. I am completely indifferent to your
      threats of vengeance because law and reason are both in my favor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! have you the right to shut me up here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should never have come to that determination, without a number
      of reasons of the most serious kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there are reasons for it, it seems.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, too many.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will perhaps inform me of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! they are only too conclusive; and if you should ever apply to
      the protection of the laws, as you threatened me just now, we should be
      obliged to state them. The fantastical eccentricity of your manner of
      living, your whimsical mode of dressing up your maids, your extravagant
      expenditure, the story of the Indian prince, to whom you offered a royal
      hospitality, your unprecedented resolution of going to live by yourself,
      like a young bachelor, the adventure of the man found concealed in your
      bed-chamber; finally, the report of your yesterday&rsquo;s conversation,
      which was faithfully taken down in shorthand, by a person employed for
      that purpose.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday?&rdquo; cried Adrienne, with as much indignation as
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! to be prepared for every event, in case you should
      misinterpret the interest we take in you, we had all your answers reported
      by a man who was concealed behind a curtain in the next room; and really,
      one day, in a calmer state of mind, when you come to read over quietly the
      particulars of what took place, you will no longer be astonished at the
      resolution we have been forced to adopt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts I have cited being thus confirmed and acknowledged, you
      will understand, my dear Mdlle. Adrienne, that your friends are perfectly
      free from responsibility. It was their duty to endeavor to cure this
      derangement of mind, which at present only shows itself in idle whims, but
      which, were it to increase, might seriously compromise the happiness of
      your future life. Now, in my opinion, we may hope to see a radical cure,
      by means of a treatment at once physical and moral; but the first
      condition of this attempt was to remove you from the scenes which so
      dangerously excited your imagination; whilst a calm retreat, the repose of
      a simple and solitary life combined with my anxious, I may say, paternal
      care, will gradually bring about a complete recovery&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a bitter laugh, &ldquo;the love
      of a noble independence, generosity, the worship of the beautiful,
      detestation of what is base and odious, such are the maladies of which you
      wish to cure me; I fear that my case is desperate, for my aunt has long
      ago tried to effect that benevolent purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we may perhaps not succeed; but at least we will attempt it.
      You see, then, there is a mass of serious facts, quite enough to justify
      the determination come to by the family-council, which puts me completely
      at my ease with regard to your menaces. It is to that I wish to return; a
      man of my age and condition never acts lightly&mdash;in such
      circumstances, and you can readily understand what I was saying to you
      just now. In a word, do not hope to leave this place before your complete
      recovery, and rest assured, that I am and shall ever be safe from your
      resentment. This being once admitted, let us talk of your actual state
      with all the interest that you naturally inspire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, that, considering I am mad, you speak to me very
      reasonably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad! no, thank heaven, my poor child, you are not mad yet&mdash;and
      I hope that, by my care, you will never be so. It is to prevent your
      becoming mad, that one must take it in time; and believe me, it is full
      time. You look at me with such an air of surprise&mdash;now tell me, what
      interest can I have in talking to you thus? Is it the hatred of your aunt
      that I wish to favor? To what end, I would ask? What can she do for me or
      against me? I think of her at this moment neither more nor less than I
      thought yesterday. Is it a new language that I hold to yourself? Did I not
      speak to you yesterday many times, of the dangerous excitement of mind in
      which you were, and of your singular whims and fancies? It is true, I made
      use of stratagem to bring you hither. No doubt, I did so. I hastened to
      avail myself of the opportunity, which you yourself offered, my poor, dear
      child; for you would never have come hither with your own good will. One
      day or the other, we must have found some pretext to get you here: and I
      said to myself; &lsquo;Her interest before all! Do your duty, let whatever
      will betide!&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst M. Baleinier was speaking, Adrienne&rsquo;s countenance, which had
      hitherto expressed alternately indignation and disdain, assumed an
      indefinable look of anguish and horror. On hearing this man talk in such a
      natural manner, and with such an appearance of sincerity, justice and
      reason, she felt herself more alarmed than ever. An atrocious deception,
      clothed in such forms, frightened her a hundred times more than the avowed
      hatred of Madame de Saint-Dizier. This audacious hypocrisy seemed to her
      so monstrous, that she believed it almost impossible.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/10437.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Adrienne had so little the art of hiding her emotions, that the doctor, a
      skillful and profound physiognomist, instantly perceived the impression he
      had produced. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;that is a
      great step. Fright has succeeded to disdain and anger. Doubt will come
      next. I shall not leave this place, till she has said to me: &lsquo;Return
      soon, my good M. Baleinier!&rsquo;&rdquo; With a voice of sorrowful
      emotion, which seemed to come from the very depths of his heart, the
      doctor thus continued: &ldquo;I see, you are still suspicious of me. All I
      can say to you is falsehood, fraud, hypocrisy, hate&mdash;is it not so?&mdash;Hate
      you? why, in heaven&rsquo;s name, should I hate you? What have you done to
      me? or rather&mdash;you will perhaps attach more value to this reason from
      a man of my sort,&rdquo; added M. Baleinier, bitterly, &ldquo;or rather,
      what interest have I to hate you?&mdash;You, that have only been reduced
      to the state in which you are by an over abundance of the most generous
      instincts&mdash;you, that are suffering, as it were, from an excess of
      good qualities&mdash;you can bring yourself coolly and deliberately to
      accuse an honest man, who has never given you any but marks of affection,
      of the basest, the blackest, the most abominable crime, of which a human
      being could be guilty. Yes, I call it a crime; because the audacious
      deception of which you accuse me would not deserve any other name. Really,
      my poor child, it is hard&mdash;very hard&mdash;and I now see, that an
      independent spirit may sometimes exhibit as much injustice and intolerance
      as the most narrow mind. It does not incense me&mdash;no&mdash;it only
      pains me: yes, I assure you&mdash;it pains me cruelly.&rdquo; And the
      doctor drew his hand across his moist eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to give the accent, the look, the gesture of M.
      Baleinier, as he thus expressed himself. The most able and practiced
      lawyer, or the greatest actor in the world, could not have played this
      scene with more effect than the doctor&mdash;or rather, no one could have
      played it so well&mdash;M. Baleinier, carried away by the influence of the
      situations, was himself half convinced of what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In few words, he felt all the horror of his own perfidy but he felt also
      that Adrienne could not believe it; for there are combinations of such
      nefarious character, that pure and upright minds are unable to comprehend
      them as possible. If a lofty spirit looks down into the abyss of evil,
      beyond a certain depth it is seized with giddiness, and no longer able to
      distinguish one object from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the most perverse of men have a day, an hour, a moment, in which
      the good instincts, planted in the heart of every creature, appear in
      spite of themselves. Adrienne was too interesting, was in too cruel a
      position, for the doctor mot to feel some pity for her in his heart; the
      tone of sympathy, which for some time past he had been obliged to assume
      towards her, and the sweet confidence of the young girl in return, had
      become for this man habitual and necessary ratifications. But sympathy and
      habit were now to yield to implacable necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny had idolized his mother; dying, she
      called him to her&mdash;and he turned away from the last prayer of a
      parent in the agony of death. After such an example, how could M.
      Baleinier hesitate to sacrifice Adrienne? The members of the Order, of
      which he formed a part, were bound to him&mdash;but he was perhaps still
      more strongly bound to them, for a long partnership in evil creates
      terrible and indissoluble ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment M. Baleinier finished his fervid address to Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, the slide of the wicket in the door was softly pushed back,
      and a pair of eyes peered attentively into the chamber, unperceived by the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne could not withdraw her gaze from the physician&rsquo;s, which
      seemed to fascinate her. Mute, overpowered, seized with a vague terror,
      unable to penetrate the dark depths of this man&rsquo;s soul, moved in
      spite of herself by the accent of sorrow, half feigned and half real&mdash;the
      young lady had a momentary feeling of doubt. For the first time, it came
      into her mind, that M. Baleinier might perhaps be committing a frightful
      error&mdash;committing it in good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the anguish of the past night, the dangers of her position, her
      feverish agitation, all concurred to fill her mind with trouble and
      indecision. She looked at the physician with ever increasing surprise, and
      making a violent effort not to yield to a weakness, of which she partly
      foresaw the dreadful consequences, she exclaimed: &ldquo;No, no, sir; I
      will not, I cannot believe it. You have too much skill, too much
      experience, to commit such an error.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An error!&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, in a grave and sorrowful tone.
      &ldquo;Let me speak to you in the name of that skill and experience, which
      you are pleased to ascribe to me. Hear me but for a moment, my dear child;
      and then I will appeal to yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me!&rdquo; replied the young girl, in a kind of stupor; &ldquo;you
      wish to persuade me, that&mdash;&rdquo; Then, interrupting herself, she
      added, with a convulsive laugh: &ldquo;This only is wanting to your
      triumph&mdash;to bring me to confess that I am mad&mdash;that my proper
      place is here&mdash;that I owe you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude. Yes, you do owe it me, even as I told you at the
      commencement of this conversation. Listen to me then; my words may be
      cruel, but there are wounds which can only be cured with steel and fire. I
      conjure you, my dear child&mdash;reflect&mdash;throw back one impartial
      glance at your past life&mdash;weigh your own thoughts&mdash;and you will
      be afraid of yourself. Remember those moments of strange excitement,
      during which, as you have told me, you seemed to soar above the earth&mdash;and,
      above all, while it is yet time&mdash;while you preserve enough clearness
      of mind to compare and judge&mdash;compare, I entreat, your manner of
      living with that of other ladies of your age? Is there a single one who
      acts as you act? who thinks as you think? unless, indeed, you imagine
      yourself so superior to other women, that, in virtue of that supremacy,
      you can justify a life and habits that have no parallel in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had such stupid pride, you know it well,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, looking at the doctor with growing terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear child, to what are we to attribute your strange and
      inexplicable mode of life? Can you even persuade yourself that it is
      founded on reason? Oh, my child! take care?&mdash;As yet, you only indulge
      in charming originalities of conduct, poetical eccentricities, sweet and
      vague reveries&mdash;but the tendency is fatal, the downward course
      irresistible. Take care, take care!&mdash;the healthful, graceful,
      spiritual portion of your intelligence has yet the upper hand, and
      imprints its stamp upon all your extravagances; but you do not know,
      believe me, with what frightful force the insane portion of the mind, at a
      given moment, develops itself and strangles up the rest. Then we have no
      longer graceful eccentricities, like yours, but ridiculous, sordid,
      hideous delusions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you frighten me,&rdquo; said the unfortunate girl, as she
      passed her trembling hands across her burning brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued M. Baleinier, in an agitated voice, &ldquo;then
      the last rays of intelligence are extinguished; then madness&mdash;for we
      must pronounce the dreaded word&mdash;gets the upper hand, and displays
      itself in furious and savage transports.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the woman upstairs,&rdquo; murmured Adrienne, as, with fixed
      and eager look, she raised her finger towards the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; continued the doctor, alarmed himself at the
      terrible consequences of his own words, but yielding to the inexorable
      fatality of his situation, &ldquo;sometimes madness takes a stupid and
      brutal form; the unfortunate creature, who is attacked by it, preserves
      nothing human but the shape&mdash;has only the instincts of the lower
      animals&mdash;eats with voracity, and moves ever backwards and forwards in
      the cell, in which such a being is obliged to be confined. That is all its
      life&mdash;all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the woman yonder.&rdquo; cried Adrienne, with a still wilder
      look, as she slowly raised her arm towards the window that was visible on
      the other side of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier. &ldquo;Like you, unhappy
      child, those women were young, fair, and sensible, but like you, alas!
      they had in them the fatal germ of insanity, which, not having been
      destroyed in time, grew, and grew, larger and ever larger, until it
      overspread and destroyed their reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, whose head was
      getting confused with terror; &ldquo;mercy! do not tell me such things!&mdash;I
      am afraid. Take me from this place&mdash;oh! take me from this place!&rdquo;
      she added, with a heartrending accent; &ldquo;for, if I remain here, I
      shall end by going mad! No,&rdquo; added she, struggling with the terrible
      agony which assailed her, &ldquo;no, do not hope it! I shall not become
      mad. I have all my reason. I am not blind enough to believe what you tell
      me. Doubtless, I live differently from others; think differently from
      others; am shocked by things that do not offend others; but what does all
      this prove? Only that I am different from others. Have I a bad heart? Am I
      envious or selfish? My ideas are singular, I knew&mdash;yes, I confess it&mdash;but
      then, M. Baleinier, is not their tendency good, generous, noble!&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
      cried Adrienne&rsquo;s supplicating voice, while her tears flowed
      abundantly, &ldquo;I have never in my life done one malicious action; my
      worst errors have arisen from excess of generosity. Is it madness to wish
      to see everybody about one too happy? And again, if you are mad, you must
      feel it yourself&mdash;and I do not feel it&mdash;and yet&mdash;I scarcely
      know&mdash;you tell me such terrible things of those two women! You ought
      to know these things better than I. But then,&rdquo; added Mdlle, de
      Cardoville, with an accent of the deepest despair, &ldquo;something ought
      to have been done. Why, if you felt an interest for me, did you wait so
      long? Why did you not take pity on me sooner? But the most frightful fact
      is, that I do not know whether I ought to believe you&mdash;for all this
      may be a snare&mdash;but no, no! you weep&mdash;it is true, then!&mdash;you
      weep!&rdquo; She looked anxiously at M. Baleinier, who, notwithstanding
      his cynical philosophy, could not restrain his tears at the sight of these
      nameless tortures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weep over me,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;so it is true! But
      (good heaven!) must there not be something done? I will do all that you
      wish&mdash;all&mdash;so that I may not be like those women. But if it
      should be too late? no, it is not too late&mdash;say it is not too late,
      my good M. Baleinier! Oh, now I ask your pardon for what I said when you
      came in&mdash;but then I did not know, you see&mdash;I did not know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To these few broken words, interrupted by sobs, and rushing forth in a
      sort of feverish excitement, succeeded a silence of some minutes, during
      which the deeply affected physician dried his tears. His resolution had
      almost failed him. Adrienne hid her face in her hands. Suddenly she again
      lifted her head; her countenance was calmer than before, though agitated
      by a nervous trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Baleinier,&rdquo; she resumed, with touching dignity, &ldquo;I
      hardly know what I said to you just now. Terror, I think, made me wander;
      I have again collected myself. Hear me! I know that I am in your power; I
      know that nothing can deliver me from it. Are you an implacable enemy? or
      are you a friend? I am not able to determine. Do you really apprehend, as
      you assure me, that what is now eccentricity will hereafter become madness&mdash;or
      are you rather the accomplice in some infernal machination? You alone can
      answer. In spite of my boasted courage, I confess myself conquered.
      Whatever is required of me&mdash;you understand, whatever it may be, I
      will subscribe to, I give you my word and you know that I hold it sacred&mdash;you
      have therefore no longer any interest to keep me here. If, on the
      contrary, you really think my reason in danger&mdash;and I own that you
      have awakened in my mind vague, but frightful doubts&mdash;tell it me, and
      I will believe you. I am alone, at your mercy, without friends, without
      counsel. I trust myself blindly to you. I know not whether I address
      myself to a deliverer or a destroyer&mdash;but I say to you&mdash;here is
      my happiness&mdash;here is my life&mdash;take it&mdash;I have no strength
      to dispute it with you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These touching words, full of mournful resignation and almost hopeless
      reliance, gave the finishing stroke to the indecision of M. Baleinier.
      Already deeply moved by this scene, and without reflecting on the
      consequences of what he was about to do, he determined at all events to
      dissipate the terrible and unjust fears with which he had inspired
      Adrienne. Sentiments of remorse and pity, which now animated the
      physician, were visible in his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! they were too visible. The moment he approached to take the hand of
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, a low but sharp voice exclaimed from behind the
      wicket: &ldquo;M. Baleinier!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rodin!&rdquo; muttered the startled doctor to himself; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      been spying on me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who calls you?&rdquo; asked the lady of the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A person that I promised to meet here this morning.&rdquo; replied
      he, with the utmost depression, &ldquo;to go with him to St. Mary&rsquo;s
      Convent, which is close at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what answer have you to give me?&rdquo; said Adrienne with
      mortal anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s solemn silence, during which he turned his face
      towards the wicket, the doctor replied, in a voice of deep emotion:
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;what I have always been&mdash;a friend incapable of
      deceiving you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne became deadly pale. Then, extending her hand to M. Baleinier, she
      said to him in a voice that she endeavored to render calm: &ldquo;Thank
      you&mdash;I will have courage&mdash;but will it be very long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a month. Solitude, reflection, a proper regimen, my
      attentive care, may do much. You will be allowed everything that is
      compatible with your situation. Every attention will be paid you. If this
      room displeases you, I will see you have another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;this or another&mdash;it is of little consequence,&rdquo;
      answered Adrienne, with an air of the deepest dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! be of good courage. There is no reason to despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you flatter me,&rdquo; said Adrienne with the shadow of a
      smile. &ldquo;Return soon,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;my dear M. Baleinier!
      my only hope rests in you now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head fell upon her bosom, her hands upon her knees and she remained
      sitting on the edge of the bed, pale, motionless, overwhelmed with woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; she said when M. Baleinier had disappeared. &ldquo;Perhaps
      mad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have enlarged upon this episode much less romantic than it may appear.
      Many times have motives of interest or vengeance or perfidious machination
      led to the abuse of the imprudent facility with which inmates are received
      in certain private lunatic asylums from the hands of their families or
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall subsequently explain our views, as to the establishment of a
      system of inspection, by the crown or the civil magistrates, for the
      periodical survey of these institutions, and others of no less importance,
      at present placed beyond the reach of all superintendence. These latter
      are the nunneries of which we will presently have an example.

      CHAPTER XLVI. PRESENTIMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hilst the
      preceding events took place in Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s asylum, other scenes
      were passing about the same hour, at Frances Baudoin&rsquo;s, in the Rue
      Brise-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning had just struck at St. Mary church; the
      day was dark and gloomy, and the sleet rattled against the windows of the
      joyless chamber of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet ignorant of her son&rsquo;s arrest, Frances had waited for him the
      whole of the preceding evening, and a good part of the night, with the
      most anxious uneasiness; yielding at length to fatigue and sleep, about
      three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, she had thrown herself on a mattress
      beside the bed of Rose and Blanche. But she rose with the first dawn of
      day, to ascend to Agricola&rsquo;s garret, in the very faint hope that he
      might have returned home some hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche had just risen, and dressed themselves. They were alone
      in the sad, chilly apartment. Spoil-sport, whom Dagobert had left in
      Paris, was stretched at full length near the cold stove; with his long
      muzzle resting on his forepaws, he kept his eye fixed on the sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having slept but little during the night, they had perceived the agitation
      and anguish of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife. They had seen her walk up and down,
      now talking to herself, now listening to the least noise that came up the
      staircase, and now kneeling before the crucifix placed at one extremity of
      the room. The orphans were not aware, that, whilst she brayed with fervor
      on behalf of her son, this excellent woman was praying for them also. For
      the state of their souls filled her with anxiety and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before, when Dagobert had set out for Chartres, Frances, having
      assisted Rose and Blanche to rise, had invited them to say their morning
      prayer: they answered with the utmost simplicity, that they did not know
      any, and that they never more than addressed their mother, who was in
      heaven. When Frances, struck with painful surprise, spoke to them of
      catechism, confirmation, communion, the sisters opened widely their large
      eyes with astonishment, understanding nothing of such talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to her simple faith, terrified at the ignorance of the young
      girls in matters of religion, Dagobert&rsquo;s wife believed their souls
      to be in the greatest peril, the more so as, having asked them if they had
      ever been baptized (at the same time explaining to them the nature of that
      sacrament), the orphans answered they did not think they had, since there
      was neither church nor priest in the village where they were born, during
      their mother&rsquo;s exile in Siberia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing one&rsquo;s self in the position of Frances, you understand how
      much she was grieved and alarmed; for, in her eyes, these young girls,
      whom she already loved tenderly, so charmed was she with their sweet
      disposition, were nothing but poor heathens, innocently doomed to eternal
      damnation. So, unable to restrain her tears, or conceal her horrors, she
      had clasped them in her arms, promising immediately to attend to their
      salvation, and regretting that Dagobert had not thought of having them
      baptized by the way. Now, it must be confessed, that this notion had never
      once occurred to the ex-grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went to her usual Sunday devotions, Frances had not dared to take
      Rose and Blanche with her, as their complete ignorance of sacred things
      would have rendered their presence at church, if not useless, scandalous;
      but, in her own fervent prayers she implored celestial mercy for these
      orphans, who did not themselves know the desperate position of their
      souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche were now left alone, in the absence of Dagobert&rsquo;s
      wife. They were still dressed in mourning, their charming faces seeming
      even more pensive than usual. Though they were accustomed to a life of
      misfortune, they had been struck, since their arrival in the Rue Brise
      Miche, with the painful contrast between the poor dwelling which they had
      come to inhabit, and the wonders which their young imagination had
      conceived of Paris, that golden city of their dreams. But, soon this
      natural astonishment was replaced by thoughts of singular gravity for
      their age. The contemplation of such honest and laborious poverty made the
      orphans have reflections no longer those of children, but of young women.
      Assisted by their admirable spirit of justice and of sympathy for all that
      is good, by their noble heart, by a character at once delicate and
      courageous, they had observed and meditated much during the last
      twenty-four hours.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Rose to Blanche, when Frances had quitted the
      room, &ldquo;Dagobert&rsquo;s poor wife is very uneasy. Did you remark in
      the night, how agitated she was? how she wept and prayed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was grieved to see it, sister, and wondered what could be the
      cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am almost afraid to guess. Perhaps we may be the cause of her
      uneasiness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, sister? Because we cannot say prayers, nor tell if we have
      ever been baptized?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seemed to give her a good deal of pain, it is true. I was
      quite touched by it, for it proves that she loves us tenderly. But I could
      not understand how we ran such terrible danger as she said we did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I either, sister. We have always tried not to displease our
      mother, who sees and hears us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We love those who love us; we are resigned to whatever may happen
      to us. So, who can reproach us with any harm?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one. But, perhaps, we may do some without meaning it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and therefore I thought: We may perhaps be the cause of her
      uneasiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, sister! yesterday Madame Baudoin tried to work at those
      sacks of coarse cloth there on the table.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but in about an half-hour, she told us sorrowfully, that she
      could not go on, because her eyes failed her, and she could not see
      clearly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that she is not able to earn her living.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but her son, M. Agricola, works for her. He looks so good,
      so gay, so frank, and so happy to devote himself for his mother. Oh,
      indeed! he is the worthy brother of our angel Gabriel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see my reason for speaking of this. Our good old Dagobert
      told us, that, when we arrived here, he had only a few pieces of money
      left.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now both he and his wife are unable to earn their living; what can
      a poor old soldier like him do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; he only knows how to love us, and take care of us,
      like his children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must then be M. Agricola who will have to support his father;
      for Gabriel is a poor priest, who possesses nothing, and can render no
      assistance to those who have brought him up. So M. Agricola will have to
      support the whole family by himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless&mdash;he owes it to father and mother&mdash;it is his
      duty, and he will do it with a good will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sister&mdash;but he owes us nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Blanche?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is obliged to work for us also, as we possess nothing in the
      world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought of that. True.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well, sister, for our father to be Duke and Marshal
      of France, as Dagobert tells us, it is all very well for us to hope great
      things from this medal, but as long as father is not here, and our hopes
      are not realized, we shall be merely poor orphans, obliged to remain a
      burden to this honest family, to whom we already owe so much, and who find
      it so hard to live, that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you pause, sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I am about to say would make other people laugh; but you will
      understand it. Yesterday, when Dagobert&rsquo;s wife saw poor Spoil-sport
      at his dinner, she said, sorrowfully: &lsquo;Alas! he eats as much as a
      man!&rsquo;&mdash;so that I could almost have cried to hear her. They must
      be very poor, and yet we have come to increase their poverty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters looked sadly at each other, while Spoil-sport pretended not to
      know they were talking of his voracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, I understand,&rdquo; said Rose, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. &ldquo;Well, we must not be at the charge of any one. We are
      young, and have courage. Till our fate is decided, let us fancy ourselves
      daughters of workmen. After all, is not our grandfather a workman? Let us
      find some employment, and earn our own living. It must be so proud and
      happy to earn one&rsquo;s living!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good little sister,&rdquo; said Blanche, kissing Rose. &ldquo;What
      happiness! You have forestalled my thought; kiss me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your project is mine exactly. Yesterday, when I heard Dagobert&rsquo;s
      wife complain so sadly that she had lost her sight. I looked into your
      large eyes, which reminded me of my own, and said to myself: &lsquo;Well!
      this poor old woman may have lost her sight, but Rose and Blanche Simon
      can see pretty clearly&rsquo;&mdash;which is a compensation,&rdquo; added
      Blanche, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo; resumed Rose, smiling in her turn, &ldquo;the
      young ladies in question are not so very awkward, as not to be able to sew
      up great sacks of coarse cloth&mdash;though it may chafe their fingers a
      little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we had both the same thought, as usual; only I wished to
      surprise you, and waited till we were alone, to tell you my plan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there is something teases me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, Dagobert and his wife will be sure to say to us:
      &lsquo;Young ladies, you are not fitted for such work. What, daughters of
      a Marshal of France sewing up great ugly bags!&rsquo; And then, if we
      insist upon it, they will add: &lsquo;Well, we have no work to give you.
      If you want any, you must hunt for it.&rsquo; What would Misses Simon do
      then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, that when Dagobert has made up his mind to anything&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! even then, if we coax him well&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in certain things; but in others he is immovable. It is just
      as when upon the journey, we wished to prevent his doing so much for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, an idea strikes me,&rdquo; cried Rose, &ldquo;an excellent
      idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? quick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the young woman they call Mother Bunch, who appears to be
      so serviceable and persevering?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! and so timid and discreet. She seems always to be afraid of
      giving offence, even if she looks at one. Yesterday, she did not perceive
      that I saw her; but her eyes were fixed on you with so good and sweet an
      expression, that tears came into mine at the very sight of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must ask her how she gets work, for certainly she lives by
      her labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. She will tell us all about it; and when we know,
      Dagobert may scold us, or try to make great ladies of us, but we will be
      as obstinate as he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is it; we must show some spirit! We will prove to him, as he
      says himself, that we have soldier&rsquo;s blood in our veins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will say to him: &lsquo;Suppose, as you say, we should one day
      be rich, my good Dagobert, we shall only remember this time with the more
      pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is agreed then, is it not, Rose? The first time we are alone
      with Mother Bunch, we must make her our confidant, and ask her for
      information. She is so good a person, that she will not refuse us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when father comes home, he will be pleased, I am sure, with our
      courage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will approve our wish to support ourselves, as if we were alone
      in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words of her sister, Rose started. A cloud of sadness, almost of
      alarm, passed over her charming countenance, as she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh,
      sister, what a horrible idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter? your look frightens me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment I heard you say, that our father would approve our
      wish to support ourselves, as if we were alone in the world&mdash;a
      frightful thought struck me&mdash;I know not why&mdash;but feel how my
      heart beats&mdash;just as if some misfortune were about to happen us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; your poor heart beats violently. But what was this
      thought? You alarm me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were prisoners, they did not at least separate us, and,
      besides, the prison was a kind of shelter&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sad one, though shared with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if, when arrived here, any accident had parted us from Dagobert&mdash;if
      we had been left alone, without help, in this great town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister! do not speak of that. It would indeed be terrible. What
      would become of us, kind heaven?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This cruel thought made the girls remain for a moment speechless with
      emotion. Their sweet faces, which had just before glowed with a noble
      hope, grew pale and sad. After a pretty long silence, Rose uplifted her
      eyes, now filled with tears, &ldquo;Why does this thought,&rdquo; she
      said, trembling, &ldquo;affect us so deeply, sister? My heart sinks within
      me, as if it were really to happen to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as frightened as you yourself. Alas! were we both to be lost
      in this immense city, what would become of us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let us give way to such ideas, Blanche! Are we not here in
      Dagobert&rsquo;s house, in the midst of good people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, sister,&rdquo; said Rose, with a pensive air, &ldquo;it is
      perhaps good for us to have had this thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we shall now find this poor lodging all the better, as it
      affords a shelter from all our fears. And when, thanks to our labor, we
      are no longer a burden to any one, what more can we need until the arrival
      of our father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall want for nothing&mdash;there you are right&mdash;but
      still, why did this thought occur to us, and why does it weigh so heavily
      on our minds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;why? Are we not here in the midst of friends that
      love us? How could we suppose that we should ever be left alone in Paris?
      It is impossible that such a misfortune should happen to us&mdash;is it
      not, my dear sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Rose, shuddering. &ldquo;If the day before
      we reached that village in Germany, where poor Jovial was killed, any one
      had said to us: &lsquo;To-morrow, you will be in prison&rsquo;&mdash;we
      should have answered as now: &lsquo;It is impossible. Is not Dagobert here
      to protect us; what have we to fear?&rsquo; And yet, sister, the day after
      we were in prison at Leipsic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not speak thus, my dear sister! It frightens me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By a sympathetic impulse, the orphans took one another by the hand, while
      they pressed close together, and looked around with involuntary fear. The
      sensation they felt was in fact deep, strange, inexplicable, and yet
      lowering&mdash;one of those dark presentiments which come over us, in
      spite of ourselves&mdash;those fatal gleams of prescience, which throw a
      lurid light on the mysterious profundities of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unaccountable glimpses of divination! often no sooner perceived than
      forgotten&mdash;but, when justified by the event, appearing with all the
      attributes of an awful fatality!
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughters of Marshal Simon were still absorbed in the mournful reverie
      which these singular thoughts had awakened, when Dagobert&rsquo;s wife,
      returning from her son&rsquo;s chamber, entered the room with a painfully
      agitated countenance.

      agitation was so perceptible that Rose could not help exclaiming: &ldquo;Good
      gracious, what is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear young ladies! I can no longer conceal it from you,&rdquo;
      said Frances, bursting into tears. &ldquo;Since yesterday I have not seen
      him. I expected my son to supper as usual, and he never came; but I would
      not let you see how much I suffered. I continued to expect him, minute
      after minute; for ten years he has never gone up to bed without coming to
      kiss me; so I spent a good part of the night close to the door, listening
      if I could hear his step. But he did not come; and, at last, about three o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning, I threw myself down upon the mattress. I have just been to
      see (for I still had a faint hope), if my son had come in this morning&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no sign of him!&rdquo; said the poor mother, drying her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche looked at each other with emotion; the same thought
      filled the minds of both; if Agricola should not return, how would this
      family live? would they not, in such an event, become doubly burdensome?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, perhaps, madame,&rdquo; said Blanche, &ldquo;M. Agricola
      remained too late at his work to return home last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no! he would have returned in the middle of the night,
      because he knew what uneasiness he would cause me by stopping out. Alas!
      some misfortune must have happened to him! Perhaps he has been injured at
      the forge, he is so persevering at his work. Oh, my poor boy! and, as if I
      did not feel enough anxiety about him, I am also uneasy about the poor
      young woman who lives upstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I left my son&rsquo;s room, I went into hers, to tell her my
      grief, for she is almost a daughter to me; but I did not find her in the
      little closet where she lives, and the bed had not even been slept in.
      Where can she have gone so early&mdash;she, that never goes out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche looked at each other with fresh uneasiness, for they
      counted much upon Mother Bunch to help them in the resolution they had
      taken. Fortunately, both they and Frances were soon to be satisfied on
      this head, for they heard two low knocks at the door, and the sempstress&rsquo;s
      voice, saying: &ldquo;Can I come in, Mrs. Baudoin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By a spontaneous impulse, Rose and Blanche ran to the door, and opened it
      to the young girl. Sleet and snow had been falling incessantly since the
      evening before; the gingham dress of the young sempstress, her scanty
      cotton shawl, and the black net cap, which, leaving uncovered two thick
      bands of chestnut hair, encircled her pale and interesting countenance,
      were all dripping wet; the cold had given a livid appearance to her thin,
      white hands; it was only in the fire of her blue eyes, generally so soft
      and timid, that one perceived the extraordinary energy which this frail
      and fearful creature had gathered from the emergency of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! where do you come from, my good Mother Bunch?&rdquo; said
      Frances. &ldquo;Just now, in going to see if my son had returned, I opened
      your door, and was quite astonished to find you gone out so early.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring you news of Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my son!&rdquo; cried Frances, trembling all over. &ldquo;What
      has happened to him? Did you see him?&mdash;Did you speak to him?&mdash;Where
      is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see him, but I know where he is.&rdquo; Then, perceiving
      that Frances grew very pale, the girl added: &ldquo;He is well; he is in
      no danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God, who has pity on a poor sinner!&mdash;who yesterday
      restored me my husband, and to-day, after a night of cruel anguish,
      assures me of the safety of my child!&rdquo; So saying, Frances knelt down
      upon the floor, and crossed herself with fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the moment of silence, caused by this pious action, Rose and
      Blanche approached Mother Bunch, and said to her in a low voice, with an
      expression of touching interest: &ldquo;How wet you are! you must be very
      cold. Take care you do not get ill. We did not venture to ask Madame
      Frances to light the fire in the stove, but now we will do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised and affected by the kindness of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters,
      the hunchback, who was more sensible than others to the least mark of
      kindness, answered them with a look of ineffable gratitude: &ldquo;I am
      much obliged to you, young ladies; but I am accustomed to the cold, and am
      moreover so anxious that I do not feel it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my son?&rdquo; said Frances, rising after she had remained some
      moments on her knees; &ldquo;why did he stay out all night? And could you
      tell me where to find him, my good girl? Will he soon come? why is he so
      long?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, Agricola is well; but I must inform you, that for
      some time&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have courage, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the blood runs cold in my veins. What has happened? why shall I
      not see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, he is arrested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo; cried Rose and Blanche, with affright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! Thy will be done!&rdquo; said Frances; &ldquo;but it is a
      great misfortune. Arrested! for what? He is so good and honest, that there
      must be some mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before yesterday,&rdquo; resumed Mother Bunch, &ldquo;I
      received an anonymous letter, by which I was informed that Agricola might
      be arrested at any moment, on account of his song. We agreed together that
      he should go to the rich young lady in the Rue de Babylone, who had
      offered him her services, and ask her to procure bail for him; to prevent
      his going to prison. Yesterday morning he set out to go to the young lady&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And neither of you told me anything of all this&mdash;why did you
      hide it from me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we might not make you uneasy, mother; for, counting on the
      generosity of that young lady, I expected Agricola back every moment. When
      he did not come yesterday evening. I said to myself: &lsquo;Perhaps the
      necessary formalities with regard to the bail have detained him.&rsquo;
      But the time passed on, and he did not make his appearance. So, I watched
      all night, expecting him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did not go to bed either, my good girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was too uneasy. This morning, not being able to conquer my
      fears, I went out before dawn. I remembered the address of the young lady
      in the Rue de Babylone, and I ran thither.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Frances, with anxiety; &ldquo;you were in the
      right. According to what my son told us, that young lady appeared very
      good and generous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch shook her head sorrowfully; a tear glittered in her eyes, as
      she continued: &ldquo;It was still dark when I arrived at the Rue de
      Babylone; I waited till daylight was come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child! you, who are so weak and timid,&rdquo; said Frances,
      with deep feeling, &ldquo;to go so far, and in this dreadful weather!&mdash;Oh,
      you have been a real daughter to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not Agricola been like a brother to me!&rdquo; said Mother
      Bunch, softly, with a slight blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it was daylight,&rdquo; she resumed: &ldquo;I ventured to ring
      at the door of the little summer-house; a charming young girl, but with a
      sad, pale countenance, opened the door to me. &lsquo;I come in the name of
      an unfortunate mother in despair,&rsquo; said I to her immediately, for I
      was so poorly dressed that I feared to be sent away as a beggar; but
      seeing, on the contrary, that the young girl listened to me with kindness,
      I asked her if, the day before, a young workman had not come to solicit a
      great favor of her mistress. &lsquo;Alas! yes,&rsquo; answered the young
      girl; &lsquo;my mistress was going to interest herself for him, and,
      hearing that he was in danger of being arrested, she concealed him here;
      unfortunately, his retreat was discovered, and yesterday afternoon, at
      four o&rsquo;clock, he was arrested and taken to prison.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the orphans took no part in this melancholy conversation, the
      sorrow and anxiety depicted in their countenances, showed how much they
      felt for the sufferings of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the young lady?&rdquo; cried Frances. &ldquo;You should have
      tried to see her, my good Mother Bunch, and begged her not to abandon my
      son. She is so rich that she must have influence, and her protection might
      save us from great calamities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, with bitter grief, &ldquo;we must
      renounce this last hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Frances. &ldquo;If this young lady is so good, she
      will have pity upon us, when she knows that my son is the only support of
      a whole family, and that for him to go to prison is worse than for
      another, because it will reduce us all to the greatest misery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this young lady,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;according to
      what I learned from her weeping maid, was taken last evening to a lunatic
      asylum: it appears she is mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad! Oh! it is horrible for her, and for us also&mdash;for now
      there is no hope. What will become of us without my son? Oh, merciful
      heaven!&rdquo; The unfortunate woman hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence followed this heart-rending outburst. Rose and Blanche
      exchanged mournful glances, for they perceived that their presence
      augmented the weighty embarrassments of this family. Mother Bunch, worn
      out with fatigue, a prey to painful emotions, and trembling with cold in
      her wet clothes, sank exhausted on a chair, and reflected on their
      desperate position.
    </p>
    <p>
      That position was indeed a cruel one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, in times of political disturbances, or of agitation amongst the
      laboring classes, caused by want of work, or by the unjust reduction of
      wages (the result of the powerful coalition of the capitalists)&mdash;often
      are whole families reduced, by a measure of preventive imprisonment, to as
      deplorable a position as that of Dagobert&rsquo;s household by Agricola&rsquo;s
      arrest&mdash;an arrest, which, as will afterwards appear, was entirely
      owing to Rodin&rsquo;s arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, with regard to this &ldquo;precautionary imprisonment,&rdquo; of
      which the victims are almost always honest and industrious mechanics,
      driven to the necessity of combining together by the In organization of
      Labor and the Insufficiency of Wages, it is painful to see the law, which
      ought to be equal for all, refuse to strikers what it grants to masters&mdash;because
      the latter can dispose of a certain sum of money. Thus, under many
      circumstances, the rich man, by giving bail, can escape the annoyance and
      inconveniences of a preventive incarceration; he deposits a sum of money,
      pledges his word to appear on a certain day, and goes back to his
      pleasures, his occupations, and the sweet delights of his family. Nothing
      can be better; an accused person is innocent till he is proved guilty; we
      cannot be too much impressed with that indulgent maxim. It is well for the
      rich man that he can avail himself of the mercy of the law. But how is it
      with the poor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only has he no bail to give, for his whole capital consists of his
      daily labor; but it is upon him chiefly that the rigors of preventive
      measures must fall with a terrible and fatal force.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rich man, imprisonment is merely the privation of ease and
      comfort, tedious hours, and the pain of separation from his family&mdash;distresses
      not unworthy of interest, for all suffering deserves pity, and the tears
      of the rich man separated from his children are as bitter as those of the
      poor. But the absence of the rich man does not condemn his family to
      hunger and cold, and the incurable maladies caused by exhaustion and
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the workman, on the contrary, imprisonment means want, misery,
      sometimes death, to those most dear to him. Possessing nothing, he is
      unable to find bail, and he goes to prison. But if he have, as it often
      happens, an old, infirm father or mother, a sick wife, or children in the
      cradle? What will become of this unfortunate family? They could hardly
      manage to live from day to day upon the wages of this man, wages almost
      always insufficient, and suddenly this only resource will be wanting for
      three or four months together.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will this family do? To whom will they have recourse?
    </p>
    <p>
      What will become of these infirm old men, these sickly wives, these little
      children, unable to gain their daily bread? If they chance to have a
      little linen and a few spare clothes, these will be carried to the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and thus they will exist for a week or so&mdash;but
      afterwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if winter adds the rigors of the season to this frightful and
      inevitable misery?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then will the imprisoned artisan see in his mind&rsquo;s eyes, during the
      long and sleepless nights, those who are dear to him, wan, gaunt, haggard,
      exhausted, stretched almost naked upon filthy straw, or huddled close
      together to warm their frozen limbs. And, should he afterwards be
      acquitted, it is ruin and desolation that he finds on his return to his
      poor dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after that long cessation from labor, he will find it difficult
      to return to his old employers. How many days will be lost in seeking for
      work! and a day without employment is a day without bread!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us repeat our opinion, that if, under various circumstances, the law
      did not afford to the rich the facility of giving bail, we could only
      lament over all such victims of individual and inevitable misfortune. But
      since the law does provide the means of setting provisionally at liberty
      those who possess a certain sum of money, why should it deprive of this
      advantage those very persons, for whom liberty is indeed indispensable, as
      it involves the existence of themselves and families?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any remedy for this deplorable state of things? We believe there
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law has fixed the minimum of bail at five hundred francs. Now five
      hundred francs represent, upon the average, six months&rsquo; labor of an
      industrious workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he have a wife and two children (which is also about the average), it
      is evidently quite impossible for him to have saved any such sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to ask of such a man five hundred francs, to enable him to continue to
      support his family, is in fact to put him beyond the pale of the law,
      though, more than any one else, he requires its protection, because of the
      disastrous consequences which his imprisonment entails upon others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it not be equitable and humane, a noble and salutary example, to
      accept, in every case where bail is allowed (and where the good character
      of the accused could be honorably established), moral guarantees, in the
      absence of material ones, from those who have no capital but their labor
      and their integrity&mdash;to accept the word of an honest man to appear
      upon the day of trial? Would it not be great and moral, in these days to
      raise the value of the lighted word, and exalt man in his own eyes, by
      showing him that his promise was held to be sufficient security?
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you so degrade the dignity of man, as to treat this proposition as an
      impossible and Utopian dream? We ask, how many prisoners of war have ever
      broken their parole, and if officers and soldiers are not brothers of the
      workingman?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without exaggerating the virtue of promise-keeping in the honest and
      laborious poor, we feel certain, that an engagement taken by the accused
      to appear on the day of trial would be always fulfilled, not only with
      fidelity, but with the warmest gratitude&mdash;for his family would not
      have suffered by his absence, thanks to the indulgence of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also another fact, of which France may well be proud. It is, that
      her magistrates (although miserably paid as the army itself) are generally
      wise, upright, humane, and independent; they have the true feeling of
      their own useful and sacred mission; they know how to appreciate the wants
      and distresses of the working classes, with whom they are so often brought
      in contact; to them might be safely granted the power of fixing those
      cases in which a moral security, the only one that can be given by the
      honest and necessitous man, should be received as sufficient.(10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if those who make the laws have so low an opinion of the people
      as to reject with disdain the suggestions we have ventured to throw out,
      let them at least so reduce the minimum of bail, as to render it available
      for those who have most need to escape the fruitless rigors of
      imprisonment. Let them take as their lowest limit, the month&rsquo;s wages
      of an artisan&mdash;say eighty francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sum would still be exorbitant; but, with the aid of friends, the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and some little advances, eighty francs might perhaps
      be found&mdash;not always, it is true&mdash;but still sometimes&mdash;and,
      at all events, many families would be rescued from frightful misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made these observations, let us return to Dagobert&rsquo;s family,
      who, in consequence of the preventive arrest of Agricola, were now reduced
      to an almost hopeless state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anguish of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife increased, the more she reflected on
      her situation, for, including the marshal&rsquo;s daughters, four persons
      were left absolutely without resource. It must be confessed, however, that
      the excellent mother thought less of herself, than of the grief which her
      son must feel in thinking over her deplorable position.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is me&mdash;Father Loriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Dagobert&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dyer, who also performed the functions of a porter, appeared at the
      door of the room. This time, his arms were no longer of a bright apple
      green, but of a magnificent violet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Baudoin,&rdquo; said Father Loriot, &ldquo;here is a letter
      that the giver of holy water at Saint Merely&rsquo;s has just brought from
      Abbe Dubois, with a request that I would bring it up to you immediately,
      as it is very pressing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from my confessor?&rdquo; said Frances, in astonishment;
      and, as she took it, added: &ldquo;Thank you, Father Loriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not want anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Father Loriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My respects to the ladies!&rdquo; and the dyer went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch, will you read this letter for me?&rdquo; said
      Frances, anxious to learn the contents of the missive in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo;&mdash;and the young girl read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;MY DEAR MADAME BAUDOIN,&mdash;I am in the habit of hearing
      you Tuesday and Saturday, but I shall not be at liberty either to-morrow
      or the last day of the week; you must then come to me this morning, unless
      you wish to remain a whole week without approaching the tribunal of
      penance.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! a week!&rdquo; cried Dagobert&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Alas!
      I am only too conscious of the necessity of going there today,
      notwithstanding the trouble and grief in which I am plunged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing herself to the orphans, she continued: &ldquo;Heaven has
      heard the prayers that I made for you, my dear young ladies; this very day
      I shall be able to consult a good and holy man with regard to the great
      dangers to which you are exposed. Poor dear souls, that are so innocent,
      and yet so guilty, without any fault of your own! Heaven is my witness,
      that my heart bleeds for you as much as for my son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche looked at each other in confusion; they could not
      understand the fears with which the state of their souls inspired the wife
      of Dagobert. The latter soon resumed, addressing the young sempstress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good girl, will you render me yet another service?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband took Agricola&rsquo;s week&rsquo;s wages with him to pay
      his journey to Chartres. It was all the money I had in the house; I am
      sure that my poor child had none about him, and in prison he will perhaps
      want some. Therefore take my silver cup, fork, and spoon, the two pair of
      sheets that remain over, and my wadded silk shawl, that Agricola gave me
      on my birthday, and carry them all to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. I will try
      and find out in which prison my son is confined, and will send him half of
      the little sum we get upon the things; the rest will serve us till my
      husband comes home. And then, what shall we do? What a blow for him&mdash;and
      only more misery in prospect&mdash;since my son is in prison, and I have
      lost my sight. Almighty Father!&rdquo; cried the unfortunate mother, with
      an expression of impatient and bitter grief, &ldquo;why am I thus
      afflicted? Have I not done enough to deserve some pity, if not for myself,
      at least for those belonging to me?&rdquo; But immediately reproaching
      herself for this outburst, she added, &ldquo;No, no! I ought to accept
      with thankfulness all that Thou sandiest me. Forgive me for these
      complaints, or punish only myself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of good courage, mother!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch. &ldquo;Agricola
      is innocent, and will not remain long in prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now I think of it,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert&rsquo;s wife,
      &ldquo;to go to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s will make you lose much time, my
      poor girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make up that in the night, Madame Frances; I could not sleep,
      knowing you in such trouble. Work will amuse me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the candles&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, I am a little beforehand with my work,&rdquo; said the
      poor girl, telling a falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, at least,&rdquo; said Frances, with moist eyes, &ldquo;for
      you are the very best creature in the world.&rdquo; So saying, she
      hastened cut of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche were left alone with Mother Bunch; at length had arrived
      the moment for which they had waited with so much impatience. Dagobert&rsquo;s
      wife proceeded to St. Merely Church, where her confessor was expecting to
      see her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. THE CONFESSIONAL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>othing could be
      more gloomy than the appearance of St. Merely Church, on this dark and
      snowy winter&rsquo;s day. Frances stopped a moment beneath the porch, to
      behold a lugubrious spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a priest was mumbling some words in a low voice, two or three dirty
      choristers, in soiled surplices, were charting the prayers for the dead,
      with an absent and sullen air, round a plain deal coffin, followed only by
      a sobbing old man and a child, miserably clad. The beadle and the
      sacristan, very much displeased at being disturbed for so wretched a
      funeral, had not deigned to put on their liveries, but, yawning with
      impatience, waited for the end of the ceremony, so useless to the
      interests of the establishment. At length, a few drops of holy water being
      sprinkled on the coffin, the priest handed the brush to the beadle, and
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then took place one of those shameful scenes, the necessary consequence of
      an ignoble and sacrilegious traffic, so frequent with regard to the
      burials of the poor, who cannot afford to pay for tapers, high mass, or
      violins&mdash;for now St. Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; Church has violins even
      for the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stretched forth his hand to the sacristan to receive the
      brush. &ldquo;Come, look sharp!&rdquo; said that official, blowing on his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emotion of the old man was profound, and his weakness extreme; he
      remained for a moment without stirring, while the brush was clasped
      tightly in his trembling hand. In that coffin was his daughter, the mother
      of the ragged child who wept by his side&mdash;his heart was breaking at
      the thought of that last farewell; he stood motionless, and his bosom
      heaved with convulsive sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, will you make haste?&rdquo; said the brutal beadle. &ldquo;Do
      you think we are going to sleep here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man quickened his movements. He made the sign of the cross over
      the corpse, and, stooping down, was about to place the brush in the hand
      of his grandson, when the sacristan, thinking the affair had lasted long
      enough, snatched the sprinkling-brush from the child, and made a sign to
      the bearers to carry away the coffin&mdash;which was immediately done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that old beggar a slow coach?&rdquo; said the beadle
      to his companion, as they went back to the sacristy. &ldquo;We shall
      hardly have time to get breakfast, and to dress ourselves for the bang-up
      funeral of this morning. That will be something like a dead man, that&rsquo;s
      worth the trouble. I shall shoulder my halberd in style!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mount your colonel&rsquo;s epaulets, to throw dust in the eyes
      of the women that let out the chairs&mdash;eh, you old rascal!&rdquo; said
      the other, with a sly look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do, Capillare? When one has a fine figure, it must be
      seen,&rdquo; answered the beadle, with a triumphant air. &ldquo;I cannot
      blind the women to prevent their losing their hearts!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus conversing; the two men reached the sacristy. The sight of the
      funeral had only increased the gloom of Frances. When she entered the
      church, seven or eight persons, scattered about upon chairs, alone
      occupied the damp and icy building. One of the distributors of holy water,
      an old fellow with a rubicund, joyous, wine-bibbing face, seeing Frances
      approach the little font, said to her in a low voice: &ldquo;Abbe Dubois
      is not yet in his box. Be quick, and you will have the first wag of his
      beard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though shocked at this pleasantry, Frances thanked the irreverent speaker,
      made devoutly the sign of the cross, advanced some steps into the church,
      and knelt down upon the stones to repeat the prayer, which she always
      offered up before approaching the tribunal of penance. Having said this
      prayer, she went towards a dark corner of the church, in which was an
      oaken confessional, with a black curtain drawn across the grated door. The
      places on each side were vacant; so Frances knelt down in that upon the
      right hand, and remained there for some time absorbed in bitter
      reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, a priest of tall stature, with gray hair and a stern
      countenance, clad in a long black cassock, stalked slowly along one of the
      aisles of the church. A short, old, misshapen man, badly dressed, leaning
      upon an umbrella, accompanied him, and from time to time whispered in his
      ear, when the priest would stop to listen with a profound and respectful
      deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the confessional, the short old man, perceiving Frances
      on her knees, looked at the priest with an air of interrogation. &ldquo;It
      is she,&rdquo; said the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in two or three hours, they will expect the two girls at St.
      Mary&rsquo;s Convent. I count upon it,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, for the sake of their souls,&rdquo; answered the priest;
      and, bowing gravely, he entered the confessional. The short old man
      quitted the church.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10465m.jpg" alt="10465m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10465.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This old man was Rodin. It was on leaving Saint Merely&rsquo;s that he
      went to the lunatic asylum, to assure himself that Dr. Baleinier had
      faithfully executed his instructions with regard to Adrienne de
      Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances was still kneeling in the interior of the confessional. One of the
      slides opened, and a voice began to speak. It was that of the priest, who,
      for the last twenty years had been the confessor of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife,
      and exercised over her an irresistible and all-powerful influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You received my letter?&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;I listen to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, father&mdash;for I have sinned!&rdquo; said Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice pronounced the formula of the benediction. Dagobert&rsquo;s wife
      answered &ldquo;amen,&rdquo; as was proper, said her confider to &ldquo;It
      is my fault,&rdquo; gave an account of the manner in which she had
      performed her last penance, and then proceeded to the enumeration of the
      new sins, committed since she had received absolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this excellent woman, a glorious martyr of industry and maternal love,
      always fancied herself sinning: her conscience was incessantly tormented
      by the fear that she had committed some incomprehensible offence. This
      mild and courageous creature, who, after a whole life of devotion, ought
      to have passed what time remained to her in calm serenity of soul, looked
      upon herself as a great sinner, and lived in continual anxiety, doubting
      much her ultimate salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Frances, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;I accuse
      myself of omitting my evening prayer the day before yesterday. My husband,
      from whom I had been separated for many years, returned home. The joy and
      the agitation caused by his arrival, made me commit this great sin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; said the voice, in a severe tone, which redoubled
      the poor woman&rsquo;s uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I accuse myself of falling into the same sin yesterday
      evening. I was in a state of mortal anxiety, for my son did not come home
      as usual, and I waited for him minute after minute, till the hour had
      passed over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I accuse myself of having told a falsehood all this week to
      my son, by letting him think that on account of his reproaching me for
      neglecting my health, I had taken a little wine for my dinner&mdash;whereas
      I had left it for him, who has more need of it, because he works so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I accuse myself of a momentary want of resignation this
      morning, when I learned that my poor son was arrested; instead of
      submitting with respect and gratitude to this new trial which the Lord
      hath sent me&mdash;alas! I rebelled against it in my grief&mdash;and of
      this I accuse myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad week,&rdquo; said the priest, in a tone of still greater
      severity, &ldquo;a bad week&mdash;for you have always put the creature
      before the Creator. But proceed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, father!&rdquo; resumed Frances, much dejected, &ldquo;I know
      that I am a great sinner; and I fear that I am on the road to sins of a
      still graver kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband brought with him from Siberia two young orphans,
      daughters of Marshal Simon. Yesterday morning, I asked them to say their
      prayers, and I learned from them, with as much fright as sorrow, that they
      know none of the mysteries of our holy faith, though they are fifteen
      years old. They have never received the sacrament, nor are they even
      baptized, father&mdash;not even baptized!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be heathens!&rdquo; cried the voice, in a tone of angry
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what so much grieves me, father; for, as I and my husband
      are in the room of parents to these young orphans, we should be guilty of
      the sins which they might commit&mdash;should we not, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&mdash;since you take the place of those who ought to
      watch over their souls. The shepherd must answer for his flock,&rdquo;
      said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they should happen to be in mortal sin, father, I and my
      husband would be in mortal sin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the voice; &ldquo;you take the place of their
      parents; and fathers and mothers are guilty of all the sins which their
      children commit when those sins arise from the want of a Christian
      education.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, father! what am I to do? I address myself to you as I would
      to heaven itself. Every day, every hour, that these poor young girls
      remain heathens, may contribute to bring about their eternal damnation,
      may it not, father?&rdquo; said Frances, in a tone of the deepest emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the voice; &ldquo;and the weight of this
      terrible responsibility rests upon you and your husband; you have the
      charge of souls!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me!&rdquo; said Frances weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not grieve yourself thus,&rdquo; answered the voice, in a
      softer tone; &ldquo;happily for these unfortunates, they have met you upon
      the way. They, will have in you and your husband good and pious examples&mdash;for
      I suppose that your husband, though formerly an ungodly person, now
      practices his religious duties!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must pray for him, father,&rdquo; said Frances, sorrowfully;
      &ldquo;grace has not yet touched his heart. He is like my poor child, who
      has also not been called to holiness. Ah, father!&rdquo; said Frances,
      drying her tears, &ldquo;these thoughts are my heaviest cross.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So neither your husband nor your son practises,&rdquo; resumed the
      voice, in a tone of reflection; &ldquo;this is serious&mdash;very serious.
      The religious education of these two unfortunate girls has yet to begin.
      In your house, they will have ever before them the most deplorable
      examples. Take care! I have warned you. You have the charge of souls&mdash;your
      responsibility is immense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, it is that which makes me wretched&mdash;I am at a loss
      what to do. Help me, and give me your counsels: for twenty years your
      voice has been to me as the voice of the Lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! you must agree with your husband to send these unfortunate
      girls to some religious house where they may be instructed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are too poor, father, to pay for their schooling, and
      unfortunately my son has just been put in prison for songs that he wrote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the fruit of impiety,&rdquo; said the voice, severely;
      &ldquo;look at Gabriel! he has followed my counsels, and is now the model
      of every Christian virtue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, Agricola, has had good qualities, father; he is so kind, so
      devoted!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without religion,&rdquo; said the voice, with redoubled severity,
      &ldquo;what you call good qualities are only vain appearances; at the
      least breath of the devil they will disappear&mdash;for the devil lurks in
      every soul that has no religion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my poor son!&rdquo; said Frances, weeping; &ldquo;I pray for
      him every day, that faith may enlighten him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always told you,&rdquo; resumed the voice, &ldquo;that you
      have been too weak with him. God now punishes you for it. You should have
      parted from this irreligious son, and not sanctioned his impiety by loving
      him as you do. &lsquo;If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off,&rsquo;
      saith the Scripture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, father! you know it is the only time I have disobeyed you;
      but I could not bring myself to part from my son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore is your salvation uncertain&mdash;but God is merciful. Do
      not fall into the same fault with regard to these young girls, whom
      Providence has sent you, that you might save them from eternal damnation.
      Do not plunge them into it by your own culpable indifference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! I have wept and prayed for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not sufficient. These unfortunate children cannot have any
      notion of good or evil. Their souls must be an abyss of scandal and
      impurity&mdash;brought up as they have been, by an impious mother, and a
      soldier devoid of religion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, father,&rdquo; said Frances, with simplicity, &ldquo;they
      are gentle as angels, and my husband, who has not quitted them since their
      birth, declares they have the best hearts in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband has dwelt all his life in mortal sin,&rdquo; said the
      voice, harshly; &ldquo;how can he judge of the state of souls? I repeat to
      you, that as you represent the parents of these unfortunates, it is not
      to-morrow, but it is today, and on the instant, that you must labor for
      their salvation, if you would not incur a terrible responsibility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true&mdash;I know it well, father&mdash;and I suffer as much
      from this fear as from grief at my son&rsquo;s arrest. But what is to be
      done? I could not instruct these young girls at home&mdash;for I have not
      the knowledge&mdash;I have only faith&mdash;and then my poor husband, in
      his blindness, makes game of sacred things, which my son, at least,
      respects in my presence, out of regard for me. Then, once more, father,
      come to my aid, I conjure you! Advise me: what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot abandon these two young souls to frightful perdition,&rdquo;
      said the voice, after a moment&rsquo;s silence: &ldquo;there are not two
      ways of saving them: there is only one, and that is to place them in a
      religious house, where they may be surrounded by good and pious examples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! if we were not so poor, or if I could still work, I
      would try to gain sufficient to pay for their board, and do for them as I
      did for Gabriel. Unfortunately, I have quite lost my sight; but you,
      father, know some charitable souls, and if you could get any of them to
      interest them, selves for these poor orphans&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is their father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in India; but, my husband tells me, he will soon be in
      France. That, however, is uncertain. Besides, it would make my heart bleed
      to see those poor children share our misery&mdash;which will soon be
      extreme&mdash;for we only live by my son&rsquo;s labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have these girls no relation here?&rdquo; asked the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was their mother who entrusted them to your husband, to bring
      them to France?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; he was obliged to set out yesterday for Chartres, on
      some very pressing business, as he told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that Dagobert had not thought fit to inform his wife
      of the hopes which the daughters of Marshall Simon founded on the
      possession of the medal, and that he had particularly charged them not to
      mention these hopes, even to Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; resumed the voice, after a pause of some moments&rsquo;
      duration, &ldquo;your husband is not in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father; but he will doubtless return this evening or to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said the voice, after another pause. &ldquo;Every
      minute lost for those two young girls is a new step on the road to
      perdition. At any moment the hand of God may smite them, for He alone
      knows the hour of our death; and were they to die in the state in which
      they now are, they would most probably be lost to all eternity. This very
      day, therefore, you must open their eyes to the divine light, and place
      them in a religious house. It is your duty&mdash;it should be your desire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, father; but, unfortunately, I am too poor, as I have
      already told you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&mdash;you do not want for zeal or faith&mdash;but even
      were you capable of directing these young girls, the impious examples of
      your husband and son would daily destroy your work. Others must do for
      these orphans, in the name of Christian charity, that which you cannot do,
      though you are answerable for them before heaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! if, thanks to you, this good work could be
      accomplished, how grateful I should be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not impossible. I know the superior of a convent, where these
      young girls would be instructed as they ought. The charge for their board
      would be diminished in consideration of their poverty; but, however small,
      it must be paid and there would be also an outfit to furnish. All that
      would be too dear for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by taking a little from my poor-box, and by applying to one or
      two generous persons, I think I shall be able to complete the necessary
      sum, and so get the young girls received at the convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, father! you are my deliverer, and these children&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to be so&mdash;but, in the interest of their salvation, and
      to make these measures really efficacious, I must attach some conditions
      to the support I offer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them, father; they are accepted beforehand. Your commands
      shall be obeyed in everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, the children must be taken this very morning to the
      convent, by my housekeeper, to whom you must bring them almost
      immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, father; that is impossible!&rdquo; cried Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible? why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the absence of my husband&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not take a such a step without consulting him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only must you abstain from consulting him, but the thing must
      be done during his absence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, father? should I not wait for his return?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for two reasons,&rdquo; answered the priest, sternly: &ldquo;first,
      because his hardened impiety would certainly lead him to oppose your pious
      resolution; secondly, because it is indispensable that these young girls
      should break off all connection with your husband, who, therefore, must be
      left in ignorance of the place of their retreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said Frances, a prey to cruel doubt and
      embarrassment, &ldquo;it is to my husband that these children were
      entrusted&mdash;and to dispose of them without his consent would be&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you instruct these children at your house&mdash;yes or no?&rdquo;
      interrupted the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father, I cannot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they exposed to fall into a state of final impenitence by
      remaining with you&mdash;yes or no?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, they are so exposed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you responsible, as you take the place of their parents, for
      the mortal sins they may commit&mdash;yes or no?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, father! I am responsible before God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it in the interest of their eternal salvation that I enjoin you
      to place them this very day in a convent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for their salvation, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, choose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, I entreat you, father if I have the right to dispose
      of them without the consent of my husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right! you have not only the right, but it is your sacred duty.
      Would you not be bound, I ask you, to rescue these unfortunate creatures
      from a fire, against the will of your husband, or during his absence?
      Well! you must now rescue them, not from a fire that will only consume the
      body, but from one in which their souls would burn to all eternity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, I implore you, father,&rdquo; said the poor woman,
      whose indecision and anguish increased every minute; &ldquo;satisfy my
      doubts!&mdash;How can I act thus, when I have sworn obedience to my
      husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obedience for good&mdash;yes&mdash;but never for evil. You confess,
      that, were it left to him, the salvation of these orphans would be
      doubtful, and perhaps impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said Frances, trembling, &ldquo;when my husband
      returns, he will ask me where are these children? Must I tell him a
      falsehood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence is not falsehood; you will tell him that you cannot answer
      his question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband is the kindest of men; but such an answer will drive him
      almost mad. He has been a soldier, and his anger will be terrible, father,&rdquo;
      said Frances, shuddering at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were his anger a hundred times more terrible, you should be
      proud to brave it in so sacred a cause!&rdquo; cried the voice, with
      indignation. &ldquo;Do you think that salvation is to be so easily gained
      on earth? Since when does the sinner, that would walk in the way of the
      Lord, turn aside for the stones and briars that may bruise and tear him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, father, pardon!&rdquo; said Frances, with the resignation
      of despair. &ldquo;Permit me to ask one more question, one only. Alas! if
      you do not guide me, how shall I find the way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Marshal Simon arrives, he will ask his children of my husband.
      What answer can he then give to their father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Marshal Simon arrives, you will let me know immediately, and
      then&mdash;I will see what is to be done. The rights of a father are only
      sacred in so far as he make use of them for the salvation of his children.
      Before and above the father on earth, is the Father in heaven, whom we
      must first serve. Reflect upon all this. By accepting what I propose to
      you, these young girls will be saved from perdition; they will not be at
      your charge; they will not partake of your misery; they will be brought up
      in a sacred institution, as, after all, the daughters of a Marshal of
      France ought to be&mdash;and, when their father arrives at Paris, if he be
      found worthy of seeing them again, instead of finding poor, ignorant, half
      savage heathens, he will behold two girls, pious, modest, and well
      informed, who, being acceptable with the Almighty, may invoke His mercy
      for their father, who, it must be owned, has great need of it&mdash;being
      a man of violence, war, and battle. Now decide! Will you, on peril of your
      soul, sacrifice the welfare of these girls in this world and the next,
      because of an impious dread of your husband&rsquo;s anger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though rude and fettered by intolerance, the confessor&rsquo;s language
      was (taking his view of the case) reasonable and just, because the honest
      priest was himself convinced of what he said; a blind instrument of Rodin,
      ignorant of the end in view, he believed firmly, that, in forcing Frances
      to place these young girls in a convent, he was performing a pious duty.
      Such was, and is, one of the most wonderful resources of the order to
      which Rodin belonged&mdash;to have for accomplices good and sincere
      people, who are ignorant of the nature of the plots in which they are the
      principal actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances, long accustomed to submit to the influence of her confessor,
      could find nothing to object to his last words. She resigned herself to
      follow his directions, though she trembled to think of the furious anger
      of Dagobert, when he should no longer find the children that a dying
      mother had confided to his care. But, according to the priest&rsquo;s
      opinion, the more terrible this anger might appear to her, the more she
      would show her pious humility by exposing herself to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done, father!&rdquo; said she, in reply to her
      confessor. &ldquo;Whatever may happen, I wilt do my duty as a Christian&mdash;in
      obedience to your commands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Lord will reward you for what you may have to suffer in the
      accomplishment of this meritorious act. You promise then, before God, that
      you will not answer any of your husband&rsquo;s questions, when he asks
      you for the daughters of Marshal Simon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, I promise!&rdquo; said Frances, with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will preserve the same silence towards Marshal Simon himself,
      in case he should return, before his daughters appear to me sufficiently
      grounded in the faith to be restored to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Frances, in a still fainter voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come and give me an account of the scene that takes place
      between you and your husband, upon his return?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; when must I bring the orphans to your house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour. I will write to the superior, and leave the letter with
      my housekeeper. She is a trusty person, and will conduct the young girls
      to the convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had listened to the exhortations of her confessor, and received
      absolution for her late sins, on condition of performing penance, Dagobert&rsquo;s
      wife left the confessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was no longer deserted. An immense crowd pressed into it, drawn
      thither by the pomp of the grand funeral of which the beadle had spoken to
      the sacristan two hours before. It was with the greatest difficulty that
      Frances could reach the door of the church, now hung with sumptuous
      drapery.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast to the poor and humble train, which had that morning so
      timidly presented themselves beneath the porch!
    </p>
    <p>
      The numerous clergy of the parish, in full procession, advanced
      majestically to receive the coffin covered with a velvet pall; the watered
      silks and stuffs of their copes and stoles, their splendid silvered
      embroideries, sparkled in the light of a thousand tapers. The beadle
      strutted in all the glory of his brilliant uniform and flashing epaulets;
      on the opposite side walked in high glee the sacristan, carrying his
      whalebone staff with a magisterial air; the voice of the choristers, now
      clad in fresh, white surplices, rolled out in bursts of thunder; the
      trumpets&rsquo; blare shook the windows; and upon the countenances of all
      those who were to have a share in the spoils of this rich corpse, this
      excellent corpse, this first-class corpse, a look of satisfaction was
      visible, intense and yet subdued, which suited admirably with the air and
      attitude of the two heirs, tall, vigorous fellows with florid complexions,
      who, without overstepping the limits of a charming modesty of enjoyment,
      seemed to cuddle and hug themselves most comfortably in their mourning
      cloaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her simplicity and pious faith, Dagobert&rsquo;s wife was
      painfully impressed with this revolting difference between the reception
      of the rich and the poor man&rsquo;s coffin at the door of the house of
      God&mdash;for surely, if equality be ever real, it is in the presence of
      death and eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sad spectacles she had witnessed, tended still further to depress
      the spirits of Frances. Having succeeded with no small trouble in making
      her way out of the church, she hastened to return to the Rue Brise-Miche,
      in order to fetch the orphans and conduct them to the housekeeper of her
      confessor, who was in her turn to take them to St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent,
      situated, as we know, next door to Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s lunatic-asylum,
      in which&mdash;Adrienne de Cardoville was confined.

      CHAPTER XLIX. MY LORD AND SPOIL-SPORT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he wife of
      Dagobert, having quitted the church, arrived at the corner of the Rue
      Brise-Miche, when she was accosted by the distributor of holy water; he
      came running out of breath, to beg her to return to Saint Mery&rsquo;s,
      where the Abbe Dubois had yet something of importance to say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Frances turned to go back, a hackney-coach stopped in front of
      the house she inhabited. The coachman quitted his box to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; said a stout woman dressed in black, who was seated
      in the carriage, and held a pug-dog upon her knees, &ldquo;ask if Mrs.
      Frances Baudoin lives in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will no doubt have recognized Mrs. Grivois, head waiting-woman
      to the Princess de Saint-Dizier, accompanied by My Lord, who exercised a
      real tyranny over his mistress. The dyer, whom we have already seen
      performing the duties of a porter, being questioned by the coachman as to
      the dwelling of Frances, came out of his workshop, and advanced gallantly
      to the coach-door, to inform Mrs. Grivois, that Frances Baudoin did in
      fact live in the house, but that she was at present from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arms, hands, and part of the face of Father Loriot were now of a
      superb gold-color. The sight of this yellow personage singularly provoked
      My Lord, and at the moment the dyer rested his hand upon the edge of the
      coach-window, the cur began to yelp frightfully, and bit him in the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! gracious heaven!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grivois, in an agony, whilst
      Father Loriot, withdrew his hand with precipitation; &ldquo;I hope there
      is nothing poisonous in the dye that you have about you&mdash;my dog is so
      delicate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she carefully wiped the pug-nose, spotted with yellow. Father
      Loriot, not at all satisfied with this speech, when he had expected to
      receive some apology from Mrs. Grivois on account of her dog&rsquo;s
      behavior, said to her, as with difficulty he restrained his anger: &ldquo;If
      you did not belong to the fair sex, which obliges me to respect you in the
      person of that wretched animal I would have the pleasure of taking him by
      the tail, and making him in one minute a dog of the brightest orange
      color, by plunging him into my cauldron, which is already on the fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dye my pet yellow!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grivois, in great wrath, as
      she descended from the hackney-coach, clasping My Lord tenderly to her
      bosom, and surveying Father Loriot with a savage look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, Mrs. Baudoin is not at home,&rdquo; said the dyer, as
      he saw the pug-dog&rsquo;s mistress advance in the direction of the dark
      staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; I will wait for her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois tartly.
      &ldquo;On which story does she live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up four pair!&rdquo; answered Father Loriot, returning abruptly to
      his shop. And he added to himself, with a chuckle at the anticipation:
      &ldquo;I hope Father Dagobert&rsquo;s big prowler will be in a bad humor,
      and give that villainous pug a shaking by the skin of his neck.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois mounted the steep staircase with some difficulty, stopping at
      every landing-place to take breath, and looking about her with profound
      disgust. At length she reached the fourth story, and paused an instant at
      the door of the humble chamber, in which the two sisters and Mother Bunch
      then were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young sempstress was occupied in collecting the different articles
      that she was about to carry to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. Rose and Blanche
      seemed happier, and somewhat less uneasy about the future; for they had
      learned from Mother Bunch, that, when they knew how to sew, they might
      between them earn eight francs a week, which would at least afford some
      assistance to the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of Mrs. Grivois in Baudoin&rsquo;s dwelling was occasioned by
      a new resolution of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny and the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier; they had thought it more prudent to send Mrs. Grivois, on
      whom they could blindly depend, to fetch the young girls, and the
      confessor was charged to inform Frances that it was not to his
      housekeeper, but to a lady that would call on her with a note from him,
      that she was to deliver the orphans, to be taken to a religious
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having knocked at the door, the waiting-woman of the Princess de Saint
      Dizier entered the room, and asked for Frances Baudoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not at home, madame,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch timidly, not a
      little astonished at so unexpected a visit, and casting down her eyes
      before the gaze of this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will wait for her, as I have important affairs to speak of,&rdquo;
      answered Mrs. Grivois, examining with curiosity and attention the faces of
      the two orphans, who also cast down their eyes with an air of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Madame Grivois sat down, not without some repugnance, in the
      old arm-chair of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, and believing that she might now
      leave her favorite at liberty, she laid him carefully on the floor.
      Immediately, a low growl, deep and hollow, sounding from behind the
      armchair, made Mrs. Grivois jump from her seat, and sent the pug-dog,
      yelping with affright, and trembling through his fat, to take refuge close
      to his mistress, with all the symptoms of angry alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is there a dog here?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grivois, stooping
      precipitately to catch up My Lord, whilst, as if he wished himself to
      answer the question, Spoil-sport rose leisurely from his place behind the
      arm-chair, and appeared suddenly, yawning and stretching himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of this powerful animal, with his double row of formidable
      pointed fangs, which he seemed to take delight in displaying as he opened
      his large jaws, Mrs. Grivois could not help giving utterance to a cry of
      terror. The snappish pug had at first trembled in all his limbs at the
      Siberian&rsquo;s approach; but, finding himself in safety on the lap of
      his mistress, he began to growl insolently, and to throw the most
      provoking glances at Spoil-sport. These the worthy companion of the
      deceased Jovial answered disdainfully by gaping anew; after which he went
      smelling round Mrs. Grivois with a sort of uneasiness, turned his back
      upon My Lord, and stretched himself at the feet of Rose and Blanche,
      keeping his large, intelligent eyes fixed upon them, as if he foresaw that
      they were menaced with some danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out that beast,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, imperiously; &ldquo;he
      frightens my dog, and may do him some harm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be afraid, madame,&rdquo; replied Rose, with a smile;
      &ldquo;Spoil-sport will do no harm, if he is not attacked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/10473m.jpg" alt="10473m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/10473.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grivois; &ldquo;an accident soon
      happens. The very sight of that enormous dog, with his wolf&rsquo;s head
      and terrible teeth, is enough to make one tremble at the injuries he might
      do one. I tell you to turn him out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois had pronounced these last words in a tone of irritation,
      which did not sound at all satisfactory in Spoil-sport&rsquo;s ears; so he
      growled and showed his teeth, turning his head in the direction of the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Spoilsport!&rdquo; said Blanche sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new personage here entered the room, and put an end to this situation,
      which was embarrassing enough for the two young girls. It was a
      commissionaire, with a letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; asked Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very pressing letter from the good man of the house; the dyer
      below stairs told me to bring it up here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Dagobert!&rdquo; cried Rose and Blanche, with a
      lively expression of pleasure. &ldquo;He is returned then? where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know whether the good man is called Dagobert or not,&rdquo;
      said the porter; &ldquo;but he is an old trooper, with a gray moustache,
      and may be found close by, at the office of the Chartres coaches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is he!&rdquo; cried Blanche. &ldquo;Give me the letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter handed it to the young girl, who opened it in all haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois was struck dumb with dismay; she knew that Dagobert had been
      decoyed from Paris, that the Abbe Dubois might have an opportunity to act
      with safety upon Frances. Hitherto, all had succeeded; the good woman had
      consented to place the young girls in the hands of a religious community&mdash;and
      now arrives this soldier, who was thought to be absent from Paris for two
      or three days at least, and whose sudden return might easily ruin this
      laborious machination, at the moment when it seemed to promise success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Blanche, when she had read the letter. &ldquo;What
      a misfortune!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then, sister?&rdquo; cried Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, half way to Chartres, Dagobert perceived that he had
      lost his purse. He was unable to continue his journey; he took a place
      upon credit, to return, and he asks his wife to send him some money to the
      office, to pay what he owes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the porter; &ldquo;for the good man
      told me to make haste, because he was there in pledge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing in the house!&rdquo; cried Blanche. &ldquo;Dear me!
      what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Mrs. Grivois felt her hopes revive for a moment, they were
      soon, however, dispelled by Mother Bunch, who exclaimed, as she pointed to
      the parcel she had just made up: &ldquo;Be satisfied, dear young ladies!
      here is a resource. The pawnbroker&rsquo;s, to which I am going, is not
      far off, and I will take the money direct to M. Dagobert: in half an hour,
      at latest, he will be here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear friend! you are right,&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;How
      good you are! you think of everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here,&rdquo; said Blanche, &ldquo;is the letter, with the
      address upon it. Take that with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch: then, addressing the
      porter, she added: &ldquo;Return to the person who sent you, and tell him
      I shall be at the coach-office very shortly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

      <a href="images/10481.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infernal hunchback!&rdquo; thought Mrs. Grivois, with suppressed
      rage, &ldquo;she thinks of everything. Without her, we should have escaped
      the plague of this man&rsquo;s return. What is to be done now? The girls
      would not go with me, before the arrival of the soldier&rsquo;s wife; to
      propose it to them would expose me to a refusal, and might compromise all.
      Once more, what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be uneasy, ladies,&rdquo; said the porter as he went out;
      &ldquo;I will go and assure the good man, that he will not have to remain
      long in pledge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Mother Bunch was occupied in tying her parcel, in which she had
      placed the silver cup, fork, and spoon, Mrs. Grivois seemed to reflect
      deeply. Suddenly she started. Her countenance, which had been for some
      moments expressive of anxiety and rage, brightened up on the instant. She
      rose, still holding My Lord in her arms, and said to the young girls:
      &ldquo;As Mrs. Baudoin does not come in, I am going to pay a visit in the
      neighborhood, and will return immediately. Pray tell her so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Mr. Grivois took her departure, a few minutes before
      Mother Bunch left.

      CHAPTER L. APPEARANCES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter she had again
      endeavored to cheer up the orphans, the sewing-girl descended the stairs,
      not without difficulty, for, in addition to the parcel, which was already
      heavy, she had fetched down from her own room the only blanket she
      possessed&mdash;thus leaving herself without protection from the cold of
      her icy garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before, tortured with anxiety as to Agricola&rsquo;s fate, the
      girl had been unable to work; the miseries of expectation and hope delayed
      had prevented her from doing so; now another day would be lost, and yet it
      was necessary to live. Those overwhelming sorrows, which deprive the poor
      of the faculty of labor, are doubly dreaded; they paralyze the strength,
      and, with that forced cessation from toil, want and destitution are often
      added to grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mother Bunch, that complete incarnation of holiest duty, had yet
      strength enough to devote herself for the service of others. Some of the
      most frail and feeble creatures are endowed with extraordinary vigor of
      soul; it would seem as if, in these weak, infirm organizations, the spirit
      reigned absolutely over the body, and knew how to inspire it with a
      factitious energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, for the last twenty-four hours, Mother Bunch had neither slept nor
      eaten; she had suffered from the cold, through the whole of a frosty
      night. In the morning she had endured great fatigue, in going, amid rain
      and snow, to the Rue de Babylone and back, twice crossing Paris and yet
      her strength was not exhausted&mdash;so immense is the power of the human
      heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had just arrived at the corner of the Rue Saint Mery. Since the recent
      Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy, there were stationed in this populous
      quarter of the town a much larger number of police-officers than usual.
      Now the young sempstress, though bending beneath the weight of her parcel,
      had quickened her pace almost to a run, when, just as she passed in front
      of one of the police, two five-franc pieces fell on the ground behind her,
      thrown there by a stout woman in black, who followed her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the stout woman pointed out the two pieces to the
      policeman, and said something hastily to him with regard to Mother Bunch.
      Then she withdrew at all speed in the direction of the Rue Brise-Miche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman, struck with what Mrs. Grivois had said to him ( for it was
      that person), picked up the money, and, running after the humpback, cried
      out to her: &ldquo;Hi, there! young woman, I say&mdash;stop! stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this outcry, several persons turned round suddenly and, as always
      happens in those quarters of the town, a nucleus of five or six persons
      soon grew to a considerable crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing that the policeman was calling to her, Mother Bunch only
      quickened her speed, wishing to get to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s as soon as
      possible, and trying to avoid touching any of the passers-by, so much did
      she dread the brutal and cruel railleries, to which her infirmity so often
      exposed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, she heard many persons running after her, and at the same
      instant a hand was laid rudely on her shoulder. It was the policeman,
      followed by another officer, who had been drawn to the spot by the noise.
      Mother Bunch turned round, struck with as much surprise as fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself in the centre of a crowd, composed chiefly of that
      hideous scum, idle and in rags, insolent and malicious, besotted with
      ignorance, brutalized by want, and always loafing about the corners.
      Workmen are scarcely ever met with in these mobs, for they are for the
      most part engaged in their daily labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, can&rsquo;t you hear? you are deaf as Punch&rsquo;s dog,&rdquo;
      said the policeman, seizing Mother Bunch so rudely by the arm, that she
      let her parcel fall at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the unfortunate girl, looking round in terror, saw herself exposed to
      all those insolent, mocking, malicious glances, when she beheld the
      cynical and coarse grimace on so many ignoble and filthy countenances, she
      trembled in all her limbs, and became fearfully pale. No doubt the
      policeman had spoken roughly to her; but how could he speak otherwise to a
      poor deformed girl, pale and trembling, with her features agitated by
      grief and fear&mdash;to a wretched creature, miserably clad, who wore in
      winter a thin cotton gown, soiled with mud, and wet with melted snow&mdash;for
      the poor sempstress had walked much and far that morning. So the policeman
      resumed, with great severity, following that supreme law of appearances
      which makes poverty always suspected: &ldquo;Stop a bit, young woman! it
      seems you are in a mighty hurry, to let your money fall without picking it
      up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was her blunt hid in her hump?&rdquo; said the hoarse voice of a
      match-boy, a hideous and repulsive specimen of precocious depravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sally was received with laughter, shouts, and hooting, which served
      to complete the sewing-girl&rsquo;s dismay and terror. She was hardly able
      to answer, in a feeble voice, as the policeman handed her the two pieces
      of silver: &ldquo;This money, sir, is not mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; said the other officer, approaching; &ldquo;a
      respectable lady saw it drop from your pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, sir, it is not so,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch,
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that you lie,&rdquo; resumed the officer; &ldquo;for the
      lady, struck with your guilty and frightened air, said to me: &lsquo;Look
      at yonder little hunchback, running away with that large parcel, and
      letting her money fall without even stopping to pick it up&mdash;it is not
      natural.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; resumed the match-vendor in his hoarse voice, &ldquo;be
      on your guard! Feel her hump, for that is her luggage-van. I&rsquo;m sure
      that you&rsquo;ll find boots, and cloaks, and umbrellas, and clocks in it&mdash;for
      I just heard the hour strike in the bend of her back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came fresh bursts of laughter and shouts and hooting, for this
      horrible mob has no pity for those who implore and suffer. The crowd
      increased more and more, and now they indulged in hoarse cries, piercing
      whistles, and all kinds of horse play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let a fellow see her; it&rsquo;s free gratis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push so; I&rsquo;ve paid for my place!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make her stand up on something, that all may have a look.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My corns are being ground: it was not worth coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show her properly&mdash;or return the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it us in the &lsquo;garden&rsquo; style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trot her out in all her paces! Kim up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy the feelings of this unfortunate creature, with her delicate mind,
      good heart, and lofty soul, and yet with so timid and nervous a character,
      as she stood alone with the two policemen in the thick of the crowd, and
      was forced to listen to all these coarse and savage insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young sempstress did not yet understand of what crime she was
      accused. She soon discovered it, however, for the policeman, seizing the
      parcel which she had picked up and now held in her trembling hands, said
      to her rudely: &ldquo;What is there in that bundle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;it is&mdash;I am going&mdash;&rdquo; The unfortunate girl
      hesitated&mdash;unable, in her terror, to find the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you have to answer,&rdquo; said the policeman,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no great shakes. Come, make haste! turn your bundle
      inside out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the policeman snatched the parcel from her, half opened it, and
      repeated, as he enumerated the divers articles it contained: &ldquo;The
      devil!&mdash;sheets&mdash;a spoon and fork&mdash;a silver mug&mdash;a
      shawl&mdash;a blanket&mdash;you&rsquo;re a downy mot! it was not so bad a
      move. Dressed like a beggar, and with silver plate about you. Oh, yes! you&rsquo;re
      a deep &lsquo;un.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those articles do not belong to you,&rdquo; said the other officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Mother Bunch, whose strength was failing
      her; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, vile hunchback! you have stolen more than you are big!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, clasping her hands in horror,
      for she now understood it all. &ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guard! make way for the lobsters!&rdquo; cried several persons
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ho! here&rsquo;s the lobsters!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire-eaters!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arab devourers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come for their dromedary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these noisy jests, two soldiers and a corporal advanced
      with much difficulty. Their bayonets and the barrels of their guns were
      alone visible above the heads of this hideous and compact crowd. Some
      officious person had been to inform the officer at the nearest guard
      house, that a considerable crowd obstructed the public way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, here is the guard&mdash;so march to the guard-house!&rdquo;
      said the policeman, taking Mother Bunch by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the poor girl, in a voice stifled by sobs,
      clasping her hands in terror, and sinking upon her knees on the pavement;
      &ldquo;sir,&mdash;have pity&mdash;let me explain&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will explain at the guard-house; so come on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;I am not a thief,&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, in a
      heart-rending tone; &ldquo;have pity upon me&mdash;do not take me away
      like a thief, before all this crowd. Oh! mercy! mercy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, there will be time to explain at the guard-house. The
      street is blocked up; so come along!&rdquo; Grasping the unfortunate
      creature by both her hands, he set her, as it were, on her feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, the corporal and his two soldiers, having succeeded in
      making their way through the crowd, approached the policeman. &ldquo;Corporal,&rdquo;
      said the latter, &ldquo;take this girl to the guard-house. I am an officer
      of the police.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, gentlemen!&rdquo; cried the girl, weeping hot tears, and
      wringing her hands, &ldquo;do not take me away, before you let me explain
      myself. I am not a thief&mdash;indeed, indeed, I am not a thief! I will
      tell you&mdash;it was to render service to others&mdash;only let me tell
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, you should give your explanations at the guard-house;
      if you will not walk, we must drag you along,&rdquo; said the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must renounce the attempt to paint this scene, at once ignoble and
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weak, overpowered, filled with alarm, the unfortunate girl was dragged
      along by the soldiers, her knees sinking under her at every step. The two
      police-officers had each to lend an arm to support her, and mechanically
      she accepted their assistance. Then the vociferations and hootings burst
      forth with redoubled fury. Half-swooning between the two men, the hapless
      creature seemed to drain the cup of bitterness to the dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath that foggy sky, in that dirty street, under the shadow of the tall
      black houses, those hideous masses of people reminded one of the wildest
      fancies of Callot and of Goya: children in rags, drunken women, grim and
      blighted figures of men, rushed against each other, pushed, fought,
      struggled, to follow with howls and hisses an almost inanimate victim&mdash;the
      victim of a deplorable mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a mistake! How one shudders to think, that such arrests may often take
      place, founded upon nothing but the suspicion caused by the appearance of
      misery, or by some inaccurate description. Can we forget the case of that
      young girl, who, wrongfully accused of participating in a shameful
      traffic, found means to escape from the persons who were leading her to
      prison, and, rushing up the stairs of a house, threw herself from a
      window, in her despair, and was crushed to death upon the paving-stones?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, after the abominable denunciation of which Mother Bunch was the
      victim, Mrs. Grivois had returned precipitately to the Rue Brise Miche.
      She ascended in haste to the fourth story, opened the door of Frances
      Baudoin&rsquo;s room, and saw&mdash;Dagobert in company with his wife and
      the two orphans!

      CHAPTER LI. THE CONVENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>et us explain in a
      few words the presence of Dagobert. His countenance was impressed with
      such an air of military frankness that the manager of the coach-office
      would have been satisfied with his promise to return and pay the money;
      but the soldier had obstinately insisted on remaining in pledge, as he
      called it, till his wife had answered his letter. When, however, on the
      return of the porter, he found that the money was coming, his scruples
      were satisfied, and he hastened to run home.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may imagine the stupor of Mrs. Grivois, when, upon entering the
      chamber, she perceived Dagobert (whom she easily recognized by the
      description she had heard of him) seated beside his wife and the orphans.
      The anxiety of Frances at sight of Mrs. Grivois was equally striking. Rose
      and Blanche had told her of the visit of a lady, during her absence, upon
      important business; and, judging by the information received from her
      confessor, Frances had no doubt that this was the person charged to
      conduct the orphans to a religious establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her anxiety was terrible. Resolved to follow the counsels of Abbe Dubois,
      she dreaded lest a word from Mrs. Grivois should put Dagobert on the scent&mdash;in
      which case all would be lost, and the orphans would remain in their
      present state of ignorance and mortal sin, for which she believed herself
      responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, who held the hands of Rose and Blanche, left his seat as the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s waiting-woman entered the room and cast
      an inquiring glance on Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment was critical&mdash;nay, decisive; but Mrs. Grivois had profited
      by the example of the Princess de Saint-Dizier. So, taking her resolution
      at once, and turning to account the precipitation with which she had
      mounted the stairs, after the odious charge she had brought against poor
      Mother Bunch, and even the emotion caused by the unexpected sight of
      Dagobert, which gave to her features an expression of uneasiness and alarm&mdash;she
      exclaimed, in an agitated voice, after the moment&rsquo;s silence
      necessary to collect her thoughts: &ldquo;Oh, madame! I have just been the
      spectator of a great misfortune. Excuse my agitation! but I am so excited&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! what is the matter?&rdquo; said Frances, in a trembling
      voice, for she dreaded every moment some indiscretion on the part of Mrs.
      Grivois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called just now,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;to speak to you
      on some important business; whilst I was waiting for you, a poor young
      woman, rather deformed, put up sundry articles in a parcel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frances; &ldquo;it was Mother Bunch, an excellent,
      worthy creature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much, madame; well, you shall hear what has happened.
      As you did not come in, I resolved to pay a visit in the neighborhood. I
      go out, and get as far as the Rue St. Mery, when&mdash;Oh, madame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Dagobert, &ldquo;what then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a crowd&mdash;I inquire what is the matter&mdash;I learn that
      a policeman has just arrested a young girl as a thief, because she had
      been seen carrying a bundle, composed of different articles which did not
      appear to belong to her&mdash;I approached&mdash;what do I behold?&mdash;the
      same young woman that I had met just before in this room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the poor child!&rdquo; exclaimed Frances, growing pale, and
      clasping her hands together. &ldquo;What a dreadful thing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain, then,&rdquo; said Dagobert to his wife. &ldquo;What was in
      this bundle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear&mdash;to confess the truth&mdash;I was a little
      short, and I asked our poor friend to take some things for me to the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and they thought she had robbed us!&rdquo; cried Dagobert;
      &ldquo;she, the most honest girl in the world! it is dreadful&mdash;you
      ought to have interfered, madame; you ought to have said that you knew
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to do so, sir; but, unfortunately, they would not hear me.
      The crowd increased every moment, till the guard came up, and carried her
      off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might die of it, she is so sensitive and timid!&rdquo;
      exclaimed Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good Mother Bunch! so gentle! so considerate!&rdquo; said
      Blanche, turning with tearful eyes towards her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not being able to help her,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Grivois &ldquo;I
      hastened hither to inform you of this misadventure&mdash;which may,
      indeed, easily be repaired&mdash;as it will only be necessary to go and
      claim the young girl as soon as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Dagobert hastily seized his hat, and said abruptly to Mrs.
      Grivois: &ldquo;Zounds, madame! you should have begun by telling us that.
      Where is the poor child? Do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not, sir; but there are still so many excited people in the
      street that, if you will have the kindness to step out, you will be sure
      to learn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the devil do you talk of kindness? It is my duty, madame. Poor
      child!&rdquo; repeated Dagobert. &ldquo;Taken up as a thief!&mdash;it is
      really horrible. I will go to the guard-house, and to the commissary of
      police for this neighborhood, and, by hook or crook, I will find her, and
      have her out, and bring her home with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Dagobert hastily departed. Frances, now that she felt more
      tranquil as to the fate of Mother Bunch, thanked the Lord that this
      circumstance had obliged her husband to go out, for his presence at this
      juncture caused her a terrible embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois had left My Lord in the coach below, for the moments were
      precious. Casting a significant glance at Frances she handed her Abbe
      Dubois&rsquo; letter, and said to her, with strong emphasis on every word:
      &ldquo;You will see by this letter, madame, what was the object of my
      visit, which I have not before been able to explain to you, but on which I
      truly congratulate myself, as it brings me into connection with these two
      charming young ladies.&rdquo; Rose and Blanche looked at each other in
      surprise. Frances took the letter with a trembling hand. It required all
      the pressing and threatening injunctions of her confessor to conquer the
      last scruples of the poor woman, for she shuddered at the thought of
      Dagobert&rsquo;s terrible indignation. Moreover, in her simplicity, she
      knew not how to announce to the young girls that they were to accompany
      this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois guessed her embarrassment, made a sign to her to be at her
      ease, and said to Rose, whilst Frances was reading the letter of her
      confessor: &ldquo;How happy your relation will be to see you, my dear
      young lady!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our relation, madame?&rdquo; said Rose, more and more astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. She knew of your arrival here, but, as she is still
      suffering from the effects of a long illness, she was not able to come
      herself to-day, and has sent me to fetch you to her. Unfortunately,&rdquo;
      added Mrs. Grivois, perceiving a movement of uneasiness on the part of the
      two sisters, &ldquo;it will not be in her power, as she tells Mrs. Baudoin
      in her letter, to see you for more than a very short time&mdash;so you may
      be back here in about an hour. But to-morrow or the next day after, she
      will be well enough to leave home, and then she will come and make
      arrangements with Mrs. Baudoin and her husband, to take you into her house&mdash;for
      she could not bear to leave you at the charge of the worthy people who
      have been so kind to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These last words of Mrs. Grivois made a favorable impression upon the two
      sisters, and banished their fears of becoming a heavy burden to Dagobert&rsquo;s
      family. If it had been proposed to them to quit altogether the house in
      the Rue Bris-Miche, without first asking the consent of their old friend,
      they would certainly have hesitated; but Mrs. Grivois had only spoken of
      an hour&rsquo;s visit. They felt no suspicion, therefore, and Rose said to
      Frances: &ldquo;We may go and see our relation, I suppose, madame, without
      waiting for Dagobert&rsquo;s return?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Frances, in a feeble voice, &ldquo;since you
      are to be back almost directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madame, I would beg these dear young ladies to come with me
      as soon as possible, as I should like to bring them back before noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are ready, madame,&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, young ladies, embrace your second mother, and come,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Grivois, who was hardly able to control her uneasiness, for she
      trembled lest Dagobert should return from one moment to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche embraced Frances, who, clasping in her arms the two
      charming and innocent creatures that she was about to deliver up, could
      with difficulty restrain her tears, though she was fully convinced that
      she was acting for their salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, young ladies,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, in the most affable
      tone, &ldquo;let us make haste&mdash;you will excuse my impatience, I am
      sure&mdash;but it is in the name of your relation that I speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having once more tenderly kissed the wife of Dagobert, the sisters quitted
      the room hand in hand, and descended the staircase close behind Mrs.
      Grivois, followed (without their being aware of it), by Spoil-sport. The
      intelligent animal cautiously watched their movements, for, in the absence
      of his master, he never let them out of his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      For greater security, no doubt, the waiting-woman of Madame de Saint
      Dizier had ordered the hackney-coach to wait for her at a little distance
      from the Rue Brise-Miche, in the cloister square. In a few seconds, the
      orphans and their conductress reached the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, missus!&rdquo; said the coachman, opening the door; &ldquo;no
      offence, I hope&mdash;but you have the most ill-tempered rascal of a dog!
      Since you put him into my coach, he has never ceased howling like a
      roasted cat, and looks as if he would eat us all up alive!&rdquo; In fact,
      My Lord, who detested solitude, was yelling in the most deplorable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, My Lord! here I am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois; then
      addressing the two sisters, she added: &ldquo;Pray, get in, my dear young
      ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche got into the coach. Before she followed them, Mrs.
      Grivois was giving to the coachman in a low voice the direction to St.
      Mary&rsquo;s Convent, and was adding other instructions, when suddenly the
      pug dog, who had growled savagely when the sisters took their seats in the
      coach, began to bark with fury. The cause of this anger was clear enough;
      Spoil-sport, until now unperceived, had with one bound entered the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pug, exasperated by this boldness, forgetting his ordinary prudence,
      and excited to the utmost by rage and ugliness of temper, sprang at his
      muzzle, and bit him so cruelly, that, in his turn, the brave Siberian dog,
      maddened by the pain, threw himself upon the teaser, seized him by the
      throat, and fairly strangled him with two grips of his powerful jaws&mdash;as
      appeared by one stifled groan of the pug, previously half suffocated with
      fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this took place in less time than is occupied by the description. Rose
      and Blanche had hardly opportunity to exclaim twice: &ldquo;Here, Spoil
      sport! down!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good gracious!&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, turning round at the
      noise. &ldquo;There again is that monster of a dog&mdash;he will certainly
      hurt my love. Send him away, young ladies&mdash;make him get down&mdash;it
      is impossible to take him with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant of the degree of Spoil-sport&rsquo;s criminality, for his paltry
      foe was stretched lifeless under a seat, the young girls yet felt that it
      would be improper to take the dog with them, and they therefore said to
      him in an angry tone, at the same time slightly touching him with their
      feet: &ldquo;Get down, Spoil-sport! go away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithful animal hesitated at first to obey this order. Sad and
      supplicatingly looked he at the orphans, and with an air of mild reproach,
      as if blaming them for sending away their only defender. But, upon the
      stern repetition of the command, he got down from the coach, with his tail
      between his legs, feeling perhaps that he had been somewhat over-hasty
      with regard to the pug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois, who was in a great hurry to leave that quarter of the town,
      seated herself with precipitation in the carriage; the coachman closed the
      door, and mounted his box; and then the coach started at a rapid rate,
      whilst Mrs. Grivois prudently let down the blinds, for fear of meeting
      Dagobert by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having taken these indispensable precautions, she was able to turn her
      attention to her pet, whom she loved with all that deep, exaggerated
      affection, which people of a bad disposition sometimes entertain for
      animals, as if then concentrated and lavished upon them all those feelings
      in which they are deficient with regard to their fellow creatures. In a
      word. Mrs. Grivois was passionately attached to this peevish, cowardly,
      spiteful dog, partly perhaps from a secret sympathy with his vices. This
      attachment had lasted for six years, and only seemed to increase as My
      Lord advanced in age.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have laid some stress on this apparently puerile detail, because the
      most trifling causes have often disastrous effects, and because we wish
      the reader to understand what must have been the despair, fury, and
      exasperation of this woman, when she discovered the death of her dog&mdash;a
      despair, a fury, and an exasperation, of which the orphans might yet feel
      the cruel consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hackney-coach had proceeded rapidly for some seconds, when Mrs.
      Grivois, who was seated with her back to the horses, called My Lord. The
      dog had very good reasons for not replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you sulky beauty!&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, soothingly;
      &ldquo;you have taken offence, have you? It was not my fault if that great
      ugly dog came into the coach, was it, young ladies? Come and kiss your
      mistress, and let us make peace, old obstinate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same obstinate silence continued on the part of the canine noble. Rose
      and Blanche began to look anxiously at each other, for they knew that
      Spoil-sport was somewhat rough in his ways, though they were far from
      suspecting what had really happened. But Mrs. Grivois, rather surprised
      than uneasy at her pug-log&rsquo;s insensibility to her affectionate
      appeals, and believing him to be sullenly crouching beneath the seat,
      stooped clown to take him up, and feeling one of his paws, drew it
      impatiently towards her whilst she said to him in a half-jesting, half
      angry tone: &ldquo;Come, naughty fellow! you will give a pretty notion of
      your temper to these young ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she took up the dog, much astonished at his unresisting torpor;
      but what was her fright, when, having placed him upon her lap, she saw
      that he was quite motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apoplexy!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;The dear creature ate too
      much&mdash;I was always afraid of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning round hastily, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Stop, coachman! stop!&rdquo;
      without reflecting that the coachman could not hear her. Then raising the
      cur&rsquo;s head, still thinking that he was only in a fit, she perceived
      with horror the bloody holes imprinted by five or six sharp fangs, which
      left no doubt of the cause of his deplorable end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first impulse was one of grief and despair. &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed; &ldquo;dead! and already cold! Oh, goodness!&rdquo; And this
      woman burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears of the wicked are ominous. For a bad man to weep, he must have
      suffered much; and, with him, the reaction of suffering, instead of
      softening the soul, inflames it to a dangerous anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, after yielding to that first painful emotion, the mistress of My
      Lord felt herself transported with rage and hate&mdash;yes, hate&mdash;violent
      hate for the young girls, who had been the involuntary cause of the dog&rsquo;s
      death. Her countenance so plainly betrayed her resentment, that Blanche
      and Rose were frightened at the expression of her face, which had now
      grown purple with fury, as with agitated voice and wrathful glance she
      exclaimed: &ldquo;It was your dog that killed him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo; said Rose; &ldquo;we had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your dog that bit Spoil-sport first,&rdquo; added Blanche,
      in a plaintive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of terror impressed on the features of the orphans recalled Mrs.
      Grivois to herself. She saw the fatal consequences that might arise from
      yielding imprudently to her anger. For the very sake of vengeance, she had
      to restrain herself, in order not to awaken suspicion in the minds of
      Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters. But not to appear to recover too soon
      from her first impression, she continued for some minutes to cast
      irritated glances at the young girls; then, little by little, her anger
      seemed to give way to violent grief; she covered her face with her hands,
      heaved a long sigh, and appeared to weep bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lady!&rdquo; whispered Rose to Blanche. &ldquo;How she weeps!&mdash;No
      doubt, she loved her dog as much as we love Spoil-sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes,&rdquo; replied Blanche. &ldquo;We also wept when our old
      Jovial was killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes, Mrs. Grivois raised her head, dried her eyes
      definitively, and said in a gentle, and almost affectionate voice: &ldquo;Forgive
      me, young ladies! I was unable to repress the first movement of
      irritation, or rather of deep sorrow&mdash;for I was tenderly attached to
      this poor dog he has never left me for six years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very sorry for this misfortune, madame,&rdquo; resumed Rose;
      &ldquo;and we regret it the more, that it seems to be irreparable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just saying to my sister, that we can the better fancy your
      grief, as we have had to mourn the death of our old horse, that carried us
      all the way from Siberia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear young ladies, let us think no more about it. It was
      my fault; I should not have brought him with me; but he was always so
      miserable, whenever I left him. You will make allowance for my weakness. A
      good heart feels for animals as well as people; so I must trust to your
      sensibility to excuse my hastiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think of it, madame; it is only your grief that afflicts us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall get over it, my dear young ladies&mdash;I shall get over
      it. The joy of the meeting between you and your relation will help to
      console me. She will be so happy. You are so charming! and then the
      singular circumstance of your exact likeness to each other adds to the
      interest you inspire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too kind to us, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I am sure you resemble each other as much in
      disposition as in face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite natural, madame,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;for since
      our birth we have never left each other a minute, whether by night or day.
      It would be strange, if we were not like in character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear young ladies! you have never left each other a
      minute?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, madame.&rdquo; The sisters joined hands with an expressive
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, how unhappy you would be, and how much to be pitied, if ever
      you were separated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! it is impossible,&rdquo; said Blanche, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How impossible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would have the heart to separate us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, my dear young ladies, it would be very cruel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame,&rdquo; resumed Blanche, &ldquo;even very wicked people
      would not think of separating us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better, my dear young ladies&mdash;pray, why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it would cause us too much grief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it would kill us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little dears!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months ago, we were shut up in prison. Well when the governor
      of the prison saw us, though he looked a very stern man, he could not help
      saying: &lsquo;It would be killing these children to separate them;&rsquo;
      and so we remained together, and were as happy as one can be in prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows your excellent heart, and also that of the persons who
      knew how to appreciate it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped, and they heard the coachman call out &ldquo;Any one
      at the gate there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! here we are at your relation&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois.
      Two wings of a gate flew open, and the carriage rolled over the gravel of
      a court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois having drawn up one of the blinds, they found themselves in a
      vast court, across the centre of which ran a high wall, with a kind of
      porch upon columns, under which was a little door. Behind this wall, they
      could see the upper part of a very large building in freestone. Compared
      with the house in the Rue Brise-Miche, this building appeared a palace; so
      Blanche said to Mrs. Grivois, with an expression of artless admiration:
      &ldquo;Dear me, madame, what a fine residence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; replied Madame Grivois; &ldquo;wait till
      you see the interior, which is much finer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coachman opened the door of the carriage, what was the rage of
      Mrs. Grivois, and the surprise of the girls, to see Spoil-sport, who had
      been clever enough to follow the coach. Pricking up his ears, and wagging
      his tail, he seemed to have forgotten his late offences, and to expect to
      be praised for his intelligent fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grivois, whose sorrows were renewed at the
      sight; &ldquo;has that abominable dog followed the coach?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A famous dog, mum,&rdquo; answered the coachman &ldquo;he never
      once left the heels of my horses. He must have been trained to it. He&rsquo;s
      a powerful beast, and two men couldn&rsquo;t scare him. Look at the throat
      of him now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress of the deceased pug, enraged at the somewhat unseasonable
      praises bestowed upon the Siberian, said to the orphans, &ldquo;I will
      announce your arrival, wait for me an instant in the coach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she went with a rapid step towards the porch, and rang the
      bell. A woman, clad in a monastic garb, appeared at the door, and bowed
      respectfully to Mrs. Grivois, who addressed her in these few words,
      &ldquo;I have brought you the two young girls; the orders of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and the princess are, that they be instantly separated, and kept apart in
      solitary cells&mdash;you understand, sister&mdash;and subjected to the
      rule for impenitents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and inform the superior, and it will be done,&rdquo; said
      the portress, with another bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, will you come, my dear young ladies?&rdquo; resumed Mrs.
      Grivois, addressing the two girls, who had secretly bestowed a few
      caresses upon Spoil sport, so deeply were they touched by his instinctive
      attachment; &ldquo;you will be introduced to your relation, and I will
      return and fetch you in half an hour. Coachman keep that dog back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose and Blanche, in getting out of the coach, were so much occupied with
      Spoil-sport, that they did not perceive the portress, who was half hidden
      behind the little door. Neither did they remark, that the person who was
      to introduce them was dressed as a nun, till, taking them by the hand, she
      had led them across the threshold, when the door was immediately closed
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Mrs. Grivois had seen the orphans safe into the convent, she
      told the coachman to leave the court-yard, and wait for her at the outer
      gate. The coachman obeyed; but Spoil-sport, who had seen Rose and Blanche
      enter by the little door, ran to it, and remained there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grivois then called the porter of the main entrance, a tall, vigorous
      fellow and said to him: &ldquo;Here are ten francs for you, Nicholas, if
      you will beat out the brains of that great dog, who is crouching under the
      porch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas shook his head, as he observed Spoil-sport&rsquo;s size and
      strength. &ldquo;Devil take me, madame!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis
      not so easy to tackle a dog of that build.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you twenty francs; only kill him before me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One ought to have a gun, and I have only an iron hammer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do; you can knock him down at a blow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame&mdash;I will try&mdash;but I have my doubts.&rdquo;
      And Nicholas went to fetch his mallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if I had the strength!&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter returned with his weapon, and advanced slowly and treacherously
      towards Spoil-sport, who was still crouching beneath the porch. &ldquo;Here,
      old fellow! here, my good dog!&rdquo; said Nicholas striking his left hand
      on his thigh, and keeping his right behind him, with the crowbar grasped
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoil-sport rose, examined Nicholas attentively, and no doubt perceiving
      by his manner that the porter meditated some evil design, bounded away
      from him, outflanked the enemy, saw clearly what was intended, and kept
      himself at a respectful distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He smells a rat,&rdquo; said Nicholas; &ldquo;the rascal&rsquo;s on
      his guard. He will not let me come near him. It&rsquo;s no go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an awkward fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois in a passion,
      as she threw a five-franc piece to Nicholas: &ldquo;at all events, drive
      him away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be easier than to kill him, madame,&rdquo; said the
      porter. Indeed, finding himself pursued, and conscious probably that it
      would be useless to attempt an open resistance, Spoil-sport fled from the
      court-yard into the street; but once there, he felt himself, as it were,
      upon neutral ground, and notwithstanding all the threats of Nicholas,
      refused to withdraw an inch further than just sufficient to keep out of
      reach of the sledge-hammer. So that when Mrs. Grivois, pale with rage,
      again stepped into her hackney-coach, in which were My Lord&rsquo;s
      lifeless remains, she saw with the utmost vexation that Spoil-sport was
      lying at a few steps from the gate, which Nicholas had just closed, having
      given up the chase in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Siberian dog, sure of finding his way back to the Rue Brise-Miche, had
      determined, with the sagacity peculiar to his race, to wait for the
      orphans on the spot where he then was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were the two sisters confined in St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, which, as
      we have already said, was next door to the lunatic asylum in which
      Adrienne de Cardoville was immured.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now conduct the reader to the dwelling of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, who
      was waiting with dreadful anxiety for the return of her husband, knowing
      that he would call her to account for the disappearance of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. THE INFLUENCE OF A CONFESSOR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ardly had the
      orphans quitted Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, when the poor woman, kneeling down,
      began to pray with fervor. Her tears, long restrained, now flowed
      abundantly; notwithstanding her sincere conviction that she had performed
      a religious duty in delivering up the girl&rsquo;s she waited with extreme
      fear her husband&rsquo;s return. Though blinded by her pious zeal, she
      could not hide from herself, that Dagobert would have good reason to be
      angry; and then this poor mother had also, under these untoward
      circumstances, to tell him of Agricola&rsquo;s arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every noise upon the stairs made Frances start with trembling anxiety;
      after which, she would resume her fervent prayers, supplicating strength
      to support this new and arduous trial. At length, she heard a step upon
      the landing-place below, and, feeling sure this time that it was Dagobert,
      she hastily seated herself, dried her tears, and taking a sack of coarse
      cloth upon her lap, appeared to be occupied with sewing&mdash;though her
      aged hands trembled so much, that she could hardly hold the needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes the door opened, and Dagobert appeared. The soldier&rsquo;s
      rough countenance was stern and sad; as he entered, he flung his hat
      violently upon the table, so full of painful thought, that he did not at
      first perceive the absence of the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;It is really terrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didst see Mother Bunch? didst claim her?&rdquo; said Frances
      hastily, forgetting for a moment her own fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have seen her&mdash;but in what a state&mdash;twas enough to
      break one&rsquo;s heart. I claimed her, and pretty loud too, I can tell
      you; but they said to me, that the commissary must first come to our place
      in order&mdash;&rdquo; here Dagobert paused, threw a glance of surprise
      round the room, and exclaimed abruptly: &ldquo;Where are the children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances felt herself seized with an icy shudder. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo;
      she began in a feeble voice&mdash;but she was unable to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are Rose and Blanche! Answer me then! And Spoil-sport, who is
      not here either!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be angry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Dagobert, abruptly, &ldquo;I see you have let
      them go out with a neighbor&mdash;why not have accompanied them yourself,
      or let them wait for me, if they wished to take a walk; which is natural
      enough, this room being so dull. But I am astonished that they should have
      gone out before they had news of good Mother Bunch&mdash;they have such
      kind hearts. But how pale you are?&rdquo; added the soldier looking nearer
      at Frances; &ldquo;what is the matter, my poor wife? Are you ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert took Frances&rsquo;s hand affectionately in his own but the
      latter, painfully agitated by these words, pronounced with touching
      goodness, bowed her head and wept as she kissed her husband&rsquo;s hand.
      The soldier, growing more and more uneasy as he felt the scalding tears of
      his wife, exclaimed: &ldquo;You weep, you do not answer&mdash;tell me,
      then, the cause of your grief, poor wife! Is it because I spoke a little
      loud, in asking you how you could let the dear children go out with a
      neighbor? Remember their dying mother entrusted them to my care&mdash;&lsquo;tis
      sacred, you see&mdash;and with them, I am like an old hen after her
      chickens,&rdquo; added he, laughing to enliven Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right in loving them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then&mdash;becalm&mdash;you know me of old. With my great,
      hoarse voice, I am not so bad a fellow at bottom. As you can trust to this
      neighbor, there is no great harm done; but, in future, my good Frances, do
      not take any step with regard to the children without consulting me. They
      asked, I suppose, to go out for a little stroll with Spoil-sport?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Who is this neighbor, to whom you have entrusted them? Where
      has she taken them? What time will she bring them back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; murmured Frances, in a failing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, with indignation; but
      restraining himself, he added, in a tone of friendly reproach: &ldquo;You
      do not know? You cannot even fix an hour, or, better still, not entrust
      them to any one? The children must have been very anxious to go out. They
      knew that I should return at any moment, so why not wait for me&mdash;eh,
      Frances? I ask you, why did they not wait for me? Answer me, will you!&mdash;Zounds!
      you would make a saint swear!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, stamping his foot;
      &ldquo;answer me, I say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The courage of Frances was fast failing. These pressing and reiterated
      questions, which might end by the discovery of the truth, made her endure
      a thousand slow and poignant tortures. She preferred coming at once to the
      point, and determined to bear the full weight of her husband&rsquo;s
      anger, like a humble and resigned victim, obstinately faithful to the
      promise she had sworn to her confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having the strength to rise, she bowed her head, allowed her arms to
      fall on either side of the chair, and said to her husband in a tone of the
      deepest despondency: &ldquo;Do with me what you will&mdash;but do not ask
      what is become of the children&mdash;I cannot answer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If a thunderbolt had fallen at the feet of the soldier, he would not have
      been more violently, more deeply moved; he became deadly pale; his bald
      forehead was covered with cold sweat; with fixed and staring look, he
      remained for some moments motionless, mute, and petrified. Then, as if
      roused with a start from this momentary torpor, and filled with a terrific
      energy, he seized his wife by the shoulders, lifted her like a feather,
      placed her on her feet before him, and, leaning over her, exclaimed in a
      tone of mingled fury and despair: &ldquo;The children!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! mercy!&rdquo; gasped Frances, in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the children?&rdquo; repeated Dagobert, as he shook with
      his powerful hands that poor frail body, and added in a voice of thunder:
      &ldquo;Will you answer? the children!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill me, or forgive me, I cannot answer you,&rdquo; replied the
      unhappy woman, with that inflexible, yet mild obstinacy, peculiar to timid
      characters, when they act from convictions of doing right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried the soldier; wild with rage, grief, despair,
      he lifted up his wife as if he would have dashed her upon the floor&mdash;but
      he was too brave a man to commit such cowardly cruelty, and, after that
      first burst of involuntary fury, he let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overpowered, Frances sank upon her knees, clasped her hands, and, by the
      faint motion of her lips, it was clear that she was praying. Dagobert had
      then a moment of stunning giddiness; his thoughts wandered; what had just
      happened was so sudden, so incomprehensible that it required some minutes
      to convince himself that his wife (that angel of goodness, whose life had
      been one course of heroic self-devotion, and who knew what the daughters
      of Marshal Simon were to him) should say to him: &ldquo;Do not ask me
      about them&mdash;I cannot answer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The firmest, the strongest mind would have been shaken by this
      inexplicable fact. But, when the soldier had a little recovered himself,
      he began to look coolly at the circumstances, and reasoned thus sensibly
      with himself: &ldquo;My wife alone can explain to me this inconceivable
      mystery&mdash;I do not mean either to beat or kill her&mdash;let us try
      every possibly method, therefore, to induce her to speak, and above all,
      let me try to control myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a chair, handed another to his wife, who was still on her knees,
      and said to her: &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; With an air of the utmost
      dejection, Frances obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, wife,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert in a broken voice,
      interrupted by involuntary starts, which betrayed the boiling impatience
      he could hardly restrain. &ldquo;Understand me&mdash;this cannot pass over
      in this manner&mdash;you know. I will never use violence towards you&mdash;just
      now, I gave way to a first moment of hastiness&mdash;I am sorry for it. Be
      sure, I shall not do so again: but, after all, I must know what has become
      of these children. Their mother entrusted them to my care, and I did not
      bring them all the way from Siberia, for you to say to me: &lsquo;Do not
      ask me&mdash;I cannot tell you what I have done with them.&rsquo; There is
      no reason in that. Suppose Marshal Simon were to arrive, and say to me,
      &lsquo;Dagobert, my children?&rsquo; what answer am I to give him? See, I
      am calm&mdash;judge for yourself&mdash;I am calm&mdash;but just put
      yourself in my place, and tell me&mdash;what answer am I to give to the
      marshal? Well&mdash;what say you! Will you speak!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my dear&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no use crying alas!&rdquo; said the soldier wiping his
      forehead, on which the veins were swollen as if they would burst; &ldquo;what
      am I to answer to the marshal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accuse me to him&mdash;I will bear it all&mdash;I will say&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, on going out, you entrusted the two girls to me, and that not
      finding them on return you asked be about them&mdash;and that my answer
      was, that I could not tell you what had become of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think the marshal will be satisfied with such reasons?&rdquo;
      cried Dagobert, clinching his fists convulsively upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, I can give no other&mdash;either to him or you&mdash;no&mdash;not
      if I were to die for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert bounded from his chair at this answer, which was given with
      hopeless resignation. His patience was exhausted; but determined not to
      yield to new bursts of anger, or to spend his breath in useless menaces,
      he abruptly opened one of the windows, and exposed his burning forehead to
      the cool air. A little calmer, he walked up and down for a few moments,
      and then returned to seat himself beside his wife. She, with her eyes
      bathed in tears, fixed her gaze upon the crucifix, thinking that she also
      had to bear a heavy cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert resumed: &ldquo;By the manner in which you speak, I see that no
      accident has happened, which might endanger the health of the children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh no! thank God, they are quite well&mdash;that is all I can
      say to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they go out alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot answer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one taken them away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear! why ask me these questions? I cannot answer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they come back here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert started up; his patience was once more exhausted. But, after
      taking a few turns in the room, he again seated himself as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said he to his wife, &ldquo;you have no interest
      to conceal from me what is become of the children. Why refuse to let me
      know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do otherwise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will change your opinion, when you know something that
      I am now forced to tell you. Listen to me well!&rdquo; added Dagobert, in
      an agitated voice; &ldquo;if these children are not restored to me before
      the 13th of February&mdash;a day close at hand&mdash;I am in the position
      of a man that would rob the daughters of Marshal Simon&mdash;rob them, d&rsquo;ye
      understand?&rdquo; said the soldier, becoming more and more agitated.
      Then, with an accent of despair which pierced Frances&rsquo;s heart, he
      continued: &ldquo;And yet I have done all that an honest man could do for
      those poor children&mdash;you cannot tell what I have had to suffer on the
      road&mdash;my cares, my anxieties&mdash;I, a soldier, with the charge of
      two girls. It was only by strength of heart, by devotion, that I could go
      through with it&mdash;and when, for my reward, I hoped to be able to say
      to their father: &lsquo;Here are your children!&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo; The
      soldier paused. To the violence of his first emotions had succeeded a
      mournful tenderness; he wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the tears rolling slowly down Dagobert&rsquo;s gray moustache,
      Frances felt for a moment her resolution give way; but, recalling the oath
      which she had made to her confessor, and reflecting that the eternal
      salvation of the orphans was at stake, she reproached herself inwardly
      with this evil temptation, which would no doubt be severely blamed by Abbe
      Dubois. She answered, therefore, in a trembling voice: &ldquo;How can they
      accuse you of robbing these children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, drawing his hand across his eyes,
      &ldquo;that if these young girls have braved so many dangers, to come
      hither, all the way from Siberia, it is that great interests are concerned&mdash;perhaps
      an immense fortune&mdash;and that, if they are not present on the 13th
      February&mdash;here, in Paris, Rue Saint Francois&mdash;all will be lost&mdash;and
      through my fault&mdash;for I am responsible for your actions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 13th February? Rue Saint Francois?&rdquo; cried Frances,
      looking at her husband with surprise. &ldquo;Like Gabriel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say about Gabriel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I took him in (poor deserted child!), he wore a bronze medal
      about his neck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bronze medal!&rdquo; cried the soldier, struck with amazement;
      &ldquo;a bronze medal with these words, &lsquo;At Paris you will be, the
      13th of February, 1832, Rue Saint Francois?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;how do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel, too!&rdquo; said the soldier speaking to himself. Then he
      added hastily: &ldquo;Does Gabriel know that this medal was found upon
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke to him of it at some time. He had also about him a
      portfolio, filled with papers in a foreign tongue. I gave them to Abbe
      Dubois, my confessor, to look over. He told me afterwards, that they were
      of little consequence; and, at a later period, when a charitable person
      named M. Rodin, undertook the education of Gabriel, and to get him into
      the seminary, Abbe Dubois handed both papers and medal to him. Since then,
      I have heard nothing of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Frances spoke of her confessor a sudden light flashed across the mind
      of the soldier, though he was far from suspecting the machinations which
      had so long been at work with regard to Gabriel and the orphans. But he
      had a vague feeling that his wife was acting in obedience to some secret
      influence of the confessional&mdash;an influence of which he could not
      understand the aim or object, but which explained, in part at least,
      Frances&rsquo;s inconceivable obstinacy with regard to the disappearance
      of the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, he rose, and said sternly to his wife,
      looking fixedly at her: &ldquo;There is a priest at the bottom of all
      this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, my dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no interest to conceal these children. You are one of the
      best of women. You see that I suffer; if you only were concerned, you
      would have pity upon me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, all this smacks of the confessional,&rdquo; resumed
      Dagobert. &ldquo;You would sacrifice me and these children to your
      confessor; but take care&mdash;I shall find out where he lives&mdash;and a
      thousand thunders! I will go and ask him who is master in my house, he or
      I&mdash;and if he does not answer,&rdquo; added the soldier, with a
      threatening expression of countenance, &ldquo;I shall know how to make him
      speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; cried Frances, clasping her hands in horror
      at these sacrilegious words; &ldquo;remember he is a priest!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest, who causes discord, treachery, and misfortune in my
      house, is as much of a wretch as any other; whom I have a right to call to
      account for the evil he does to me and mine. Therefore, tell me
      immediately where are the children&mdash;or else, I give you fair warning,
      I will go and demand them of the confessor. Some crime is here hatching,
      of which you are an accomplice without knowing it, unhappy woman! Well, I
      prefer having to do with another than you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Frances, in a mild, firm voice, &ldquo;you
      cannot think to impose by violence on a venerable man, who for twenty
      years has had the care of my soul. His age alone should be respected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No age shall prevent me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! where are you going? You alarm me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to your church. They must know you there&mdash;I will
      ask for your confessor&mdash;and we shall see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you, my dear,&rdquo; cried Frances, throwing herself in a
      fright before Dagobert, who was hastening towards the door; &ldquo;only
      think, to what you will expose yourself! Heavens! insult a priest? Why, it
      is one of the reserved cases!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These last words, which appeared most alarming to the simplicity of
      Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, did not make any impression upon the soldier. He
      disengaged himself from her grasp, and was going to rush out bareheaded,
      so high was his exasperation, when the door opened, and the commissary of
      police entered, followed by Mother Bunch and a policeman, carrying the
      bundle which he had taken from the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The commissary!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, who recognized him by his
      official scarf. &ldquo;Ah! so much the better&mdash;he could not have come
      at a fitter moment.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LIII. THE EXAMINATION.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Mistress Frances Baudoin?&rdquo; asked the magistrate.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;it is I,&rdquo; said Frances. Then, perceiving the
      pale and trembling sewing-girl, who did not dare to come forward, she
      stretched out her arms to her. &ldquo;Oh, my poor child!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, bursting into tears; &ldquo;forgive&mdash;forgive us&mdash;since
      it is for our sake you have suffered this humiliation!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dagobert&rsquo;s wife had tenderly embraced the young sempstress, the
      latter, turning towards the commissary, said to him with an expression of
      sad and touching dignity: &ldquo;You see, sir, that I am not a thief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the magistrate, addressing Frances, &ldquo;am I
      to understand that the silver mug, the shawl, the sheets contained in this
      bundle&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belong to me, sir. It was to render me a service that this dear
      girl, who is the best and most honest creature in the world, undertook to
      carry these articles to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the magistrate sternly to the policeman, &ldquo;you
      have committed a deplorable error. I shall take care to report you, and
      see that you are punished. You may go, sir.&rdquo; Then, addressing Mother
      Bunch, with an air of real regret, he added: &ldquo;I can only express my
      sorrow for what has happened. Believe me, I deeply feel for the cruel
      position in which you have been placed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it, sir,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, &ldquo;and I thank
      you.&rdquo; Overcome by so many emotions, she sank upon a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate was about to retire, when Dagobert, who had been seriously
      reflecting for some minutes, said to him in a firm voice: &ldquo;Please to
      hear me, Sir; I have a deposition to make.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I am about to say is very important; it is to you, in your
      quality of a magistrate, that I make this declaration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as a magistrate I will hear you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I arrived here two days ago, bringing with me from Russia two girls
      who had been entrusted to me by their mother&mdash;the wife of Marshal
      Simon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Marshal Simon, Duke de Ligny?&rdquo; said the commissary, very
      much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir. Well, I left them here, being obliged to get out on
      pressing business. This morning, during my absence, they disappeared&mdash;and
      I am certain I know the man who has been the cause of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear,&rdquo; said Frances, much alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the magistrate, &ldquo;your declaration is a very
      serious one. Disappearance of persons&mdash;sequestration, perhaps. But
      are you quite sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These young ladies were here an hour ago; I repeat, sir, that
      during my absence, they have been taken away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt the sincerity of your declaration, sir; but still it
      is difficult to explain so strange an abduction. Who tells you that these
      young girls will not return? Besides, whom do you suspect? One word,
      before you make your accusation. Remember, it is the magistrate who hears
      you. On leaving this place, the law will take its course in this affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I wish, Sir; I am responsible for those young ladies
      to their father. He may arrive at any moment, and I must be prepared to
      justify myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand all these reasons, sir; but still have a care you are
      not deceived by unfounded suspicions. Your denunciation once made, I may
      have to act provisionally against the person accused. Now, if you should
      be under a mistake, the consequences would be very serious for you; and,
      without going further,&rdquo; said the magistrate, pointing to Mother
      Bunch, with emotion, &ldquo;you see what are the results of a false
      accusation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, my dear,&rdquo; cried Frances, terrified at the
      resolution of Dagobert to accuse Abbe Dubois; &ldquo;do not say a word
      more, I entreat you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the more the soldier reflected, the more he felt convinced that
      nothing but the influence of her confessor could have induced Frances to
      act as she had done; so he resumed, with assurance: &ldquo;I accuse my
      wife&rsquo;s confessor of being the principal or the accomplice in the
      abduction of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances uttered a deep groan, and hid her face in her hands; while Mother
      Bunch, who had drawn nigh, endeavored to console her. The magistrate had
      listened to Dagobert with extreme astonishment, and he now said to him
      with some severity: &ldquo;Pray, sir, do not accuse unjustly a man whose
      position is in the highest degree respectable&mdash;a priest, sir?&mdash;yes,
      a priest? I warned you beforehand to reflect upon what you advanced. All
      this becomes very serious, and, at your age, any levity in such matters
      would be unpardonable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, sir!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with impatience; &ldquo;at my
      age, one has common sense. These are the facts. My wife is one of the best
      and most honorable of human creatures&mdash;ask any one in the
      neighborhood, and they will tell you so&mdash;but she is a devotee; and,
      for twenty years, she has always seen with her confessor&rsquo;s eyes. She
      adores her son, she loves me also; but she puts the confessor before us
      both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the commissary, &ldquo;these family details&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are indispensable, as you shall see. I go out an hour ago, to look
      after this poor girl here. When I come back, the young ladies have
      disappeared. I ask my wife to whom she has entrusted them, and where they
      are; she falls at my feet weeping, and says: &lsquo;Do what you will with
      me, but do not ask me what has become of the children. I cannot answer
      you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is thus true, madame?&rdquo; cried the commissary, looking at
      Frances with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anger, threats, entreaties, had no effect,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert;
      &ldquo;to everything she answered as mildly as a saint: &lsquo;I can tell
      you nothing!&rsquo; Now, sir, I maintain that my wife has no interest to
      take away these children; she is under the absolute dominion of her
      confessor; she has acted by his orders and for his purposes; he is the
      guilty party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Dagobert spoke, the commissary looked more and more attentively at
      Frances, who, supported by the hunchback, continued to weep bitterly.
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, the magistrate advanced towards
      Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, and said to her: &ldquo;Madame, you have heard what
      your husband has just declared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say in your justification?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, &ldquo;it is not my wife that I
      accuse&mdash;I do not mean that; it is her confessor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you have applied to a magistrate; and the magistrate must act
      as he thinks best for the discovery of the truth. Once more, madame,&rdquo;
      he resumed, addressing Frances, &ldquo;what have you to say in your
      justification?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! nothing, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that your husband left these young girls in your charge
      when he went out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that, on his return, they were no longer to be found?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that, when he asked you where they were, you told him
      that you could give him no information on the subject?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissary appeared to wait for Frances&rsquo; reply with kind of
      anxious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said she, with the utmost simplicity, &ldquo;that
      was the answer I made my husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, madame!&rdquo; said the magistrate, with an air of painful
      astonishment; &ldquo;that was your only answer to all the prayers and
      commands of your husband? What! you refused to give him the least
      information? It is neither probable nor possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the truth, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but, after all, madame, what have you done with the young
      ladies that were entrusted to your care?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you nothing about it, sir. If I would not answer my poor
      husband, I certainly will not answer any one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, &ldquo;was I wrong? An honest,
      excellent woman like that, who was always full of good sense and
      affection, to talk in this way&mdash;is it natural? I repeat to you, sir
      that it is the work of her confessor; act against him promptly and
      decidedly, we shall soon know all, and my poor children will be restored
      to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; continued the commissary, without being able to
      repress a certain degree of emotion, &ldquo;I am about to speak to you
      very severely. My duty obliges me to do so. This affair becomes so serious
      and complicated, that I must instantly commence judicial proceedings on
      the subject. You acknowledge that these young ladies have been left in
      your charge, and that you cannot produce them. Now, listen to me: if you
      refuse to give any explanation in the matter, it is you alone that will be
      accused of their disappearance. I shall be obliged, though with great
      regret, to take you into custody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Frances, with the utmost alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her!&rdquo; exclaimed Dagobert; &ldquo;never! It is her confessor
      that I accuse, not my poor wife. Take her into custody, indeed!&rdquo; He
      ran towards her, as if he would protect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late, sir,&rdquo; said the commissary. &ldquo;You have
      made your charge for the abduction of these two young ladies. According to
      your wife&rsquo;s own declaration, she alone is compromised up to this
      point. I must take her before the Public Prosecutor, who will decide what
      course to pursue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say, sir,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in a menacing tone, &ldquo;that
      my wife shall not stir from this room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the commissary coolly, &ldquo;I can appreciate
      your feelings; but, in the interest of justice, I would beg you not to
      oppose a necessary measure&mdash;a measure which, moreover, in ten minutes
      it would be quite impossible for you to prevent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, spoken with calmness, recalled the soldier to himself.
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do not accuse my wife.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, my dear&mdash;do not think of me!&rdquo; said Frances,
      with the angelic resignation of a martyr. &ldquo;The Lord is still pleased
      to try me sorely; but I am His unworthy servant, and must gratefully
      resign myself to His will. Let them arrest me, if they choose; I will say
      no more in prison than I have said already on the subject of those poor
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, &ldquo;you see that my wife is out
      of her head. You cannot arrest her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no charge, proof, or indication against the other person
      whom you accuse, and whose character should be his protection. If I take
      your wife, she may perhaps be restored to you after a preliminary
      examination. I regret,&rdquo; added the commissary, in a tone of pity,
      &ldquo;to have to execute such a mission, at the very moment when your son&rsquo;s
      arrest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, looking with speechless astonishment
      at his wife and Mother Bunch; &ldquo;what does he say? my son?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not then aware of it? Oh, sir, a thousand pardons!&rdquo;
      said the magistrate, with painful emotion. &ldquo;It is distressing to
      make you such a communication.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son!&rdquo; repeated Dagobert, pressing his two hands to his
      forehead. &ldquo;My son! arrested!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a political offence of no great moment,&rdquo; said the
      commissary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this is too much. All comes on me at once!&rdquo; cried the
      soldier, falling overpowered into a chair, and hiding his face with his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a touching farewell, during which, in spite of her terror, Frances
      remained faithful to the vow she had made to the Abbe Dubois&mdash;Dagobert,
      who had refused to give evidence against his wife, was left leaning upon a
      table, exhausted by contending emotions, and could not help explaining:
      &ldquo;Yesterday, I had with me my wife, my son, my two poor orphans&mdash;and
      now&mdash;I am alone&mdash;alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he pronounced these words, in a despairing tone, a mild sad
      voice was heard close behind him, saying timidly: &ldquo;M. Dagobert, I am
      here; if you will allow me, I will remain and wait upon you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mother Bunch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Trusting that the reader&rsquo;s sympathy is with the old soldier thus
      left desolate, with Agricola in his prison, Adrienne in hers, the
      madhouse, and Rose and Blanche Simon in theirs, the nunnery; we hasten to
      assure him (or her, as the case may be), that not only will their future
      steps be traced, but the dark machinations of the Jesuits, and the
      thrilling scenes in which new characters will perform their varied parts,
      pervaded by the watching spirit of the Wandering Jew, will be revealed in
      Part Second of this work, entitled: THE CHASTISEMENT.

      unassisted eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1831, the powerful Order of the Jesuits saw fit to begin to
      act upon information which had for some time been digesting in their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it related to a sum estimated at no less than thirty or forty millions
      of francs, it is no wonder that they should redouble all exertions to
      obtain it from the rightful owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were, presumably, the descendants of Marius, Count of Rennepont, in
      the reign of Louis XIV. of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were distinguished from other men by a simple token, which all, in
      the year above named, had in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bronze medal, bearing these legends on reverse and obverse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 VICTIM
                  of
               L. C. D. J.
               Pray for me!

                 PARIS,
            February the 13th, 1682.

                IN PARIS
            Rue St Francois, No. 3,
            In a century and a half
               you will be.

            February the 13th, 1832.
               PRAY FOR ME!
</pre>
    <p>
      Those who had this token were descendants of a family whom, a hundred and
      fifty years ago, persecution scattered through the world, in emigration
      and exile; in changes of religion, fortune and name. For this family&mdash;what
      grandeur, what reverses, what obscurity, what lustre, what penury, what
      glory! How many crimes sullied, how many virtues honored it! The history
      of this single family is the history of humanity! Passing through many
      generations, throbbing in the veins of the poor and the rich, the
      sovereign and the bandit, the wise and the simple, the coward and the
      brave, the saint and the atheist, the blood flowed on to the year we have
      named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven representatives summed up the virtue, courage, degradation,
      splendor, and poverty of the race. Seven: two orphan twin daughters of
      exiled parents, a dethroned prince, a humble missionary priest, a man of
      the middle class, a young lady of high name and large fortune, and a
      working man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate scattered them in Russia, India, France, and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans, Rose and Blanche Simon, had left their dead mother&rsquo;s
      grave in Siberia, under charge of a trooper named Francis Baudoin, alias
      Dagobert, who was as much attached to them as he had been devoted to their
      father, his commanding general.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the road to France, this little party had met the first check, in the
      only tavern of Mockern village. Not only had a wild beast showman, known
      as Morok the lion-tamer, sought to pick a quarrel with the inoffensive
      veteran, but that failing, had let a panther of his menagerie loose upon
      the soldier&rsquo;s horse. That horse had carried Dagobert, under General
      Simon&rsquo;s and the Great Napoleon&rsquo;s eyes, through many battles;
      had borne the General&rsquo;s wife (a Polish lady under the Czar&rsquo;s
      ban) to her home of exile in Siberia, and their children now across Russia
      and Germany, but only to perish thus cruelly. An unseen hand appeared in a
      manifestation of spite otherwise unaccountable. Dagobert, denounced as a
      French spy, and his fair young companions accused of being adventuresses
      to help his designs, had so kindled at the insult, not less to him than to
      his old commander&rsquo;s daughters, that he had taught the pompous
      burgomaster of Mockern a lesson, which, however, resulted in the
      imprisonment of the three in Leipsic jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Simon, who had vainly sought to share his master&rsquo;s St.
      Helena captivity, had gone to fight the English in India. But
      notwithstanding his drilling of Radja-sings sepoys, they had been beaten
      by the troops taught by Clive, and not only was the old king of Mundi
      slain, and the realm added to the Company&rsquo;s land, but his son,
      Prince Djalma, taken prisoner. However, at length released, he had gone to
      Batavia, with General Simon. The prince&rsquo;s mother was a Frenchwoman,
      and among the property she left him in the capital of Java, the general
      was delighted to find just such another medal as he knew was in his wife&rsquo;s
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unseen hand of enmity had reached to him, for letters miscarried, and
      he did not know either his wife&rsquo;s decease or that he had twin
      daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a trick, on the eve of the steamship leaving Batavia for the Isthmus of
      Suez, Djalma was separated from his friend, and sailing for Europe alone,
      the latter had to follow in another vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary priest trod the war trails of the wilderness, with that
      faith and fearlessness which true soldiers of the cross should evince. In
      one of these heroic undertakings, Indians had captured him, and dragging
      him to their village under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, they had
      nailed him in derision to a cross, and prepared to scalp him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if an unseen hand of a foe smote or stabbed at the sons of Rennepont,
      a visible interpositor had often shielded them, in various parts of the
      globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, seeming of thirty years of age, very tall, with a countenance as
      lofty as mournful, marked by the black eyebrows meeting, had thrown
      himself&mdash;during a battle&rsquo;s height&mdash;between a gun of a park
      which General Simon was charging and that officer. The cannon vomited its
      hail of death, but when the flame and smoke had passed, the tall man stood
      erect as before, smiling pityingly on the gunner, who fell on his knees as
      frightened as if he beheld Satan himself. Again, as General Simon lay upon
      the lost field of Waterloo, raging with his wounds, eager to die after
      such a defeat, this same man staunched his hurts, and bade him live for
      his wife&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years after, wearing the same unalterable look, this man accosted Dagobert
      in Siberia, and gave him for General Simon&rsquo;s wife, the diary and
      letters of her husband, written in India, in little hope of them ever
      reaching her hands. And at the year our story opens, this man unbarred the
      cell-door of Leipsic jail, and let Dagobert and the orphans out, free to
      continue their way into France.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, when the scalping-knife had traced its mark around the
      head of Gabriel the missionary, and when only the dexterous turn and tug
      would have removed the trophy, a sudden apparition had terrified the
      superstitious savages. It was a woman of thirty, whose brown tresses
      formed a rich frame around a royal face, toned down by endless sorrowing.
      The red-skins shrank from her steady advance, and when her hand was
      stretched out between them and their young victim, they uttered a howl of
      alarm, and fled as if a host of their foemen were on their track. Gabriel
      was saved, but all his life he was doomed to bear that halo of martyrdom,
      the circling sweep of the scalper&rsquo;s knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a Jesuit. By the orders of his society he embarked for Europe. We
      should say here, that he, though owning a medal of the seven described,
      was unaware that he should have worn it. His vessel was driven by storms
      to refit at the Azores, where he had changed ship into the same as was
      bearing Prince Djalma to France, via Portsmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gales followed him, and sated their fury by wrecking the &ldquo;Black
      Eagle&rdquo; on the Picardy coast. This was at the same point as were a
      disabled Hamburg steamer, among whose passengers where Dagobert and his
      two charges, was destroyed the same night. Happily the tempest did not
      annihilate them all. There were saved, Prince Djalma and a countryman of
      his, one Faringhea, a Thuggee chief, hunted out of British India;
      Dagobert, and Rose and Blanche Simon, whom Gabriel had rescued. These
      survivors had recovered, thanks to the care they had received in
      Cardoville House, a country mansion which had sheltered them, and except
      the prince and the Strangler chief, the others were speedily able to go on
      to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old grenadier and the orphans&mdash;until General Simon should be
      heard from&mdash;dwelt in the former&rsquo;s house. His son had kept it,
      from his mother&rsquo;s love for the life-long home. It was such a mean
      habitation as a workman like Agricola Baudoin could afford to pay the rent
      of, and far from the fit abode of the daughters of the Duke de Ligny and
      Marshal of France, which Napoleon had created General Simon, though the
      rank had only recently been approved by the restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in Paris the unknown hostile hand showed itself more malignant than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady of high name and large fortune was Adrienne de Cardoville,
      whose aunt, the Princess de Saint-Dizier, was a Jesuit. Through her and
      her accomplices&rsquo; machinations, the young lady&rsquo;s forward yet
      virtuous, wildly aspiring but sensible, romantic but just, character was
      twisted into a passable reason for her immurement in a mad-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      This asylum adjoined St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, into which Rose and Blanche
      Simon were deceitfully conducted. To secure their removal, Dagobert had
      been decoyed into the country, under pretence of showing some of General
      Simon&rsquo;s document&rsquo;s to a lawyer; his son Agricola arrested for
      treason, on account of some idle verses the blacksmith poet was guilty of,
      and his wife rendered powerless, or, rather, a passive assistant, by the
      influence of the confessional! When Dagobert hurried back from his wild
      goose chase, he found the orphans gone: Mother Bunch (a fellow-tenant of
      the house, who had been brought up in the family) ignorant, and his wife
      stubbornly refusing to break the promise she had given her confessor, and
      acquaint a single soul where she had permitted the girls to be taken. In
      his rage, the soldier rashly accused that confessor, but instead of
      arresting the Abbe Dubois, it was Mrs. Baudoin whom the magistrate felt
      compelled to arrest, as the person whom alone he ventured to commit for
      examination in regard to the orphans&rsquo; disappearance. Thus triumphs,
      for the time being, the unseen foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans in a nunnery; the dethroned prince a poor castaway in a
      foreign land; the noble young lady in a madhouse; the missionary priest
      under the thumb of his superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the man of the middle class, and the working man, who concluded the
      list of this family, we are to read of them, as well as of the others, in
      the pages which now succeed these.

      CHAPTER I. THE MASQUERADE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following day
      to that on which Dagobert&rsquo;s wife (arrested for not accounting for
      the disappearance of General Simon&rsquo;s daughters) was led away before
      a magistrate, a noisy and animated scene was transpiring on the Place du
      Chatelet, in front of a building whose first floor and basement were used
      as the tap-rooms of the &ldquo;Sucking Calf&rdquo; public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carnival night was dying out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a number of maskers, grotesquely and shabbily bedecked, had rushed
      out of the low dance-houses in the Guildhall Ward, and were roaring out
      staves of songs as they crossed the square. But on catching sight of a
      second troop of mummers running about the water-side, the first party
      stopped to wait for the others to come up, rejoicing, with many a shout,
      in hopes of one of those verbal battles of slang and smutty talk which
      made Vade so illustrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mob&mdash;nearly all its members half seas over, soon swollen by the
      many people who have to be up early to follow their crafts&mdash;suddenly
      concentrated in one of the corners of the square, so that a pale, deformed
      girl, who was going that way, was caught in the human tide. This was
      Mother Bunch. Up with the lark, she was hurrying to receive some work from
      her employer. Remembering how a mob had treated her when she had been
      arrested in the streets only the day before, by mistake, the poor
      work-girl&rsquo;s fears may be imagined when she was now surrounded by the
      revellers against her will. But, spite of all her efforts&mdash;very
      feeble, alas!&mdash;she could not stir a step, for the band of
      merry-makers, newly arriving, had rushed in among the others, shoving some
      of them aside, pushing far into the mass, and sweeping Mother Bunch&mdash;who
      was in their way&mdash;clear over to the crowd around the public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comers were much finer rigged out than the others, for they
      belonged to the gay, turbulent class which goes frequently to the
      Chaumiere, the Prado, the Colisee, and other more or less rowdyish haunts
      of waltzers, made up generally of students, shop-girls, and counter
      skippers, clerks, unfortunates, etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This set, while retorting to the chaff of the other party, seemed to be
      very impatiently expecting some singularly desired person to put in her
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following snatches of conversation, passing between clowns and
      columbines, pantaloons and fairies, Turks and sultans, debardeurs and
      debardeuses, paired off more or less properly, will give an idea of the
      importance of the wished-for personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ordered the spread to be for seven in the morning, so their
      carriages ought to have come up afore now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Werry like, but the Bacchanal Queen has got to lead off the last
      dance in the Prado.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to thunder I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a known that, and I&rsquo;d
      &lsquo;a stayed there to see her&mdash;my beloved Queen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobinet; if you call her your beloved Queen again, I&rsquo;ll
      scratch you! Here&rsquo;s a pinch for you, anyhow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow, wow, Celeste! hands off! You are black-spotting the be-yutiful
      white satin jacket my mamma gave me when I first came out as Don
      Pasqually!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you call the Bacchanal Queen your beloved, then? What am I,
      I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my beloved, but not my Queen, for there is only one moon in
      the nights of nature, and only one Bacchanal Queen in the nights at the
      Prado.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit from a valentine! You can&rsquo;t come over me
      with such rubbish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobinet&rsquo;s right! the Queen was an out-and-outer tonight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In prime feather!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw her more on the go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, my eyes! wasn&rsquo;t her dress stunning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took your breath away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crushing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Im-mense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last kick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one but she can get up such dresses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, then, the dance!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! it was at once bounding waving, twisting! There is not
      such another bayadere under the night-cap of the sky!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobinet, give me back my shawl directly. You have already spoilt it
      by rolling it round your great body. I don&rsquo;t choose to have my
      things ruined for hulking beasts who call other women bayaderes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste, simmer down. I am disguised as a Turk, and, when I talk of
      bayaderes, I am only in character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Celeste is like them all, Gobinet; she&rsquo;s jealous of the
      Bacchanal Queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealous!&mdash;do you think me jealous? Well now! that&rsquo;s too
      bad. If I chose to be as showy as she is they would talk of me as much.
      After all, it&rsquo;s only a nickname that makes her reputation! nickname!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that you have nothing to envy her&mdash;since you are called
      Celeste!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough, Gobinet, that Celeste is my real name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it&rsquo;s fancied a nickname&mdash;when one looks in your
      face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gobinet, I will put that down to your account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Oscar will help you to add it up, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and you shall see the total. When I carry one, the remainder
      will not be you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celeste, you make me cry! I only meant to say that your celestial
      name does not go well with your charming little face, which is still more
      mischievous than that of the Bacchanal Queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; wheedle me now, wretch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear by the accursed head of my landlord, that, if you liked,
      you could spread yourself as much as the Bacchanal Queen&mdash;which is
      saying a great deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, that the Bacchanal had cheek enough, in all
      conscience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to speak of her fascinating the bobbies!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And magnetizing the beaks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may get as angry as they please; she always finishes by making
      them laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they all call her: Queen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night she charmed a slop (as modest as a country girl) whose
      purity took up arms against the famous dance of the Storm-blown Tulip.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a quadrille! Sleepinbuff and the Bacchanal Queen, having
      opposite to them Rose-Pompon and Ninny Moulin!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all four making tulips as full-blown as could be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-bye, is it true what they say of Ninny Moulin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that he is a writer, and scribbles pamphlets on religion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true. I have often seen him at my employer&rsquo;s, with
      whom he deals; a bad paymaster, but a jolly fellow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pretends to be devout, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, my boy&mdash;when it is necessary; then he is my
      Lord Dumoulin, as large as life. He rolls his eyes, walks with his head on
      one side, and his toes turned in; but, when the piece is played out, he
      slips away to the balls of which he is so fond. The girls christened him
      Ninny Moulin. Add, that he drinks like a fish, and you have the photo of
      the cove. All this doesn&rsquo;t prevent his writing for the religious
      newspapers; and the saints, whom he lets in even oftener than himself, are
      ready to swear by him. You should see his articles and his tracts&mdash;only
      see, not read!&mdash;every page is full of the devil and his horns, and
      the desperate fryings which await your impious revolutionists&mdash;and
      then the authority of the bishops, the power of the Pope&mdash;hang it!
      how could I know it all? This toper, Ninny Moulin, gives good measure
      enough for their money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, that he is both a heavy drinker and a heavy swell. How
      he rattled on with little Rose-Pompon in the dance and the full-blown
      tulip!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a rum chap he looked in his Roman helmet and top-boots.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose-Pompon dances divinely, too; she has the poetic twist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t show her heels a bit!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the Bacchanal Queen is six thousand feet above the level
      of any common leg-shaker. I always come back to her step last night in the
      full-blown tulip.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was huge!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was serene!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were father of a family, I would entrust her with the
      education of my sons!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that step, however, which offended the bobby&rsquo;s
      modesty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, it was a little free.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free as air&mdash;so the policeman comes up to her, and says:
      &lsquo;Well, my Queen, is your foot to keep on a-goin&rsquo; up forever?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;No, modest warrior!&rsquo; replies the Queen; &lsquo;I practice the
      step only once every evening, to be able to dance it when I am old. I made
      a vow of it, that you might become an inspector.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a comic card!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she will remain always with Sleepinbuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has been a workman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense! it would preciously become us, students and
      shop-boys, to give ourselves airs! No; but I am astonished at the Queen&rsquo;s
      fidelity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been a team for three or four good months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wild upon him, and he on her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must lead a gay life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I ask myself where the devil Sleepinbuff gets all the
      money he spends. It appears that he pays all last night&rsquo;s expenses,
      three coaches-and-four, and a breakfast this morning for twenty, at ten
      francs a-head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he has come into some property. That&rsquo;s why Ninny
      Moulin, who has a good nose for eating and drinking, made acquaintance
      with him last night&mdash;leaving out of the question that he may have
      some designs on the Bacchanal Queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! In a lot! He&rsquo;s rather too ugly. The girls like to dance
      with him because he makes people laugh&mdash;but that&rsquo;s all. Little
      Rose-Pompon, who is such a pretty creature, has taken him as a harmless
      chap-her-own, in the absence of her student.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coaches! the coaches!&rdquo; exclaimed the crowd, all with one
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forced to stop in the midst of the maskers, Mother Bunch had not lost a
      word of this conversation, which was deeply painful to her, as it
      concerned her sister, whom she had not seen for a long time. Not that the
      Bacchanal Queen had a bad heart; but the sight of the wretched poverty of
      Mother Bunch&mdash;a poverty which she had herself shared, but which she
      had not had the strength of mind to bear any longer&mdash;caused such
      bitter grief to the gay, thoughtless girl, that she would no more expose
      herself to it, after she had in vain tried to induce her sister to accept
      assistance, which the latter always refused, knowing that its source could
      not be honorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coaches! the coaches!&rdquo; once more exclaimed the crowd, as
      they pressed forward with enthusiasm, so that Mother Bunch, carried on
      against her will, was thrust into the foremost rank of the people
      assembled to see the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, a curious sight. A man on horseback, disguised as a
      postilion, his blue jacket embroidered with silver, and enormous tail from
      which the powder escaped in puffs, and a hat adorned with long ribbons,
      preceded the first carriage, cracking his whip, and crying with all his
      might: &ldquo;Make way for the Bacchanal Queen and her court!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In an open carriage, drawn by four lean horses, on which rode two old
      postilions dressed as devils, was raised a downright pyramid of men and
      women, sitting, standing, leaning, in every possible variety of odd,
      extravagant, and grotesque costume; altogether an indescribable mass of
      bright colors, flowers, ribbons, tinsel and spangles. Amid this heap of
      strange forms and dresses appeared wild or graceful countenances, ugly or
      handsome features&mdash;but all animated by the feverish excitement of a
      jovial frenzy&mdash;all turned with an expression of fanatical admiration
      towards the second carriage, in which the Queen was enthroned, whilst they
      united with the multitude in reiterated shouts of &ldquo;Long live the
      Bacchanal Queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This second carriage, open like the first, contained only the four dancers
      of the famous step of the Storm-blown Tulip&mdash;Ninny Moulin, Rose
      Pompon, Sleepinbuff, and the Bacchanal Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumoulin, the religious writer, who wished to dispute possession of Mme.
      de la Sainte-Colombe with his patron, M. Rodin&mdash;Dumoulin, surnamed
      Ninny Moulin, standing on the front cushions, would have presented a
      magnificent study for Callot or Gavarni, that eminent artist, who unites
      with the biting strength and marvellous fancy of an illustrious
      caricaturist, the grace, the poetry, and the depth of Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ninny Moulin, who was about thirty-five years of age, wore very much back
      upon his head a Roman helmet of silver paper. A voluminous plume of black
      feathers, rising from a red wood holder, was stuck on one side of this
      headgear, breaking the too classic regularity of its outline. Beneath this
      casque, shone forth the most rubicund and jovial face, that ever was
      purpled by the fumes of generous wine. A prominent nose, with its
      primitive shape modestly concealed beneath a luxuriant growth of pimples,
      half red, half violet, gave a funny expression to a perfectly beardless
      face; while a large mouth, with thick lips turning their insides outwards,
      added to the air of mirth and jollity which beamed from his large gray
      eyes, set flat in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing this joyous fellow, with a paunch like Silenus, one could not
      help asking how it was, that he had not drowned in wine, a hundred times
      over, the gall, bile, and venom which flowed from his pamphlets against
      the enemies of Ultramontanism, and how his Catholic beliefs could float
      upwards in the midst of these mad excesses of drink and dancing. The
      question would have appeared insoluble, if one had not remembered how many
      actors, who play the blackest and most hateful first robbers on the stage,
      are, when off it, the best fellow in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather being cold, Ninny Moulin wore a kind of box-coat, which, being
      half-open, displayed his cuirass of scales, and his flesh-colored
      pantaloons, finishing just below the calf in a pair of yellow tops to his
      boots. Leaning forward in front of the carriage, he uttered wild shouts of
      delight, mingled with the words: &ldquo;Long live the Bacchanal Queen!&rdquo;&mdash;after
      which, he shook and whirled the enormous rattle he held in his hand.
      Standing beside him, Sleepinbuff waved on high a banner of white silk, on
      which were the words: &ldquo;Love and joy to the Bacchanal Queen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleepinbuff was about twenty-five years of age. His countenance was gay
      and intelligent, surrounded by a collar of chestnut-colored whiskers; but
      worn with late hours and excesses, it expressed a singular mixture of
      carelessness and hardihood, recklessness and mockery; still, no base or
      wicked passion had yet stamped there its fatal impress. He was the perfect
      type of the Parisian, as the term is generally applied, whether in the
      army, in the provinces, on board a king&rsquo;s ship, or a merchantman. It
      is not a compliment, and yet it is far from being an insult; it is an
      epithet which partakes at once of blame, admiration, and fear; for if, in
      this sense, the Parisian is often idle and rebellious, he is also quick at
      his work, resolute in danger, and always terribly satirical and fond of
      practical jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed in a very flashy style. He wore a black velvet jacket with
      silver buttons, a scarlet waistcoat, trousers with broad blue stripes, a
      Cashmere shawl for a girdle with ends loosely floating, and a chimney-pot
      hat covered with flowers and streamers. This disguise set off his light,
      easy figure to great advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the carriage, standing up on the cushions, were Rose Pompon
      and the Bacchanal Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose-Pompon, formerly a fringe-maker, was about seventeen years old, and
      had the prettiest and most winning little face imaginable. She was gayly
      dressed in debardeur costume. Her powdered wig, over which was smartly
      cocked on one side an orange and green cap laced with silver, increased
      the effect of her bright black eyes, and of her round, carnation cheeks.
      She wore about her neck an orange-colored cravat, of the same material as
      her loose sash. Her tight jacket and narrow vest of light green velvet,
      with silver ornaments, displayed to the best advantage a charming figure,
      the pliancy of which must have well suited the evolutions of the Storm
      blown Tulip. Her large trousers, of the same stuff and color as the
      jacket, were not calculated to hide any of her attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacchanal Queen, being at the least a head taller, leaned with one
      hand on the shoulder of Rose-Pompon. Mother Bunch&rsquo;s sister ruled,
      like a true monarch, over this mad revelry, which her very presence seemed
      to inspire, such influence had her own mirth and animation over all that
      surrounded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a tall girl of about twenty years of age, light and graceful, with
      regular features, and a merry, racketing air. Like her sister, she had
      magnificent chestnut hair, and large blue eyes; but instead of being soft
      and timid, like those of the young sempstress, the latter shone with
      indefatigable ardor in the pursuit of pleasure. Such was the energy of her
      vivacious constitution, that, notwithstanding many nights and days passed
      in one continued revel, her complexion was as pure, her cheeks as rosy,
      her neck as fresh and fair, as if she had that morning issued from some
      peaceful home. Her costume, though singular and fantastic, suited her
      admirably. It was composed of a tight, long-waisted bodice in cloth of
      gold, trimmed with great bunches of scarlet ribbon, the ends of which
      streamed over her naked arms, and a short petticoat of scarlet velvet,
      ornamented with golden beads and spangles. This petticoat reached half way
      down a leg, at once trim and strong, in a white silk stocking, and red
      buskin with brass heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had any Spanish dancer a more supple, elastic, and tempting form,
      than this singular girl, who seemed possessed with the spirit of dancing
      and perpetual motion, for, almost every moment, a slight undulation of
      head, hips, and shoulders seemed to follow the music of an invisible
      orchestra; while the tip of her right foot, placed on the carriage door in
      the most alluring manner, continued to beat time&mdash;for the Bacchanal
      Queen stood proudly erect upon the cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of gilt diadem, the emblem of her noisy sovereignty, hung with
      little bells, adorned her forehead. Her long hair, in two thick braids,
      was drawn back from her rosy cheeks, and twisted behind her head. Her left
      hand rested on little Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s shoulder, and in her right she
      held an enormous nosegay, which she waved to the crowd, accompanying each
      salute with bursts of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to give a complete idea of this noisily animated and
      fantastic scene, which included also a third carriage, filled, like the
      first, with a pyramid of grotesque and extravagant masks. Amongst the
      delighted crowd, one person alone contemplated the picture with deep
      sorrow. It was Mother Bunch, who was still kept, in spite of herself, in
      the first rank of spectators.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20029.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Separated from her sister for a long time, she now beheld her in all the
      pomp of her singular triumph, in the midst of the cries of joy, and the
      applause of her companions in pleasure. Yet the eyes of the young
      sempstress grew dim with tears; for, though the Bacchanal Queen seemed to
      share in the stunning gayety of all around her&mdash;though her face was
      radiant with smiles, and she appeared fully to enjoy the splendors of her
      temporary elevation&mdash;yet she had the sincere pity of the poor
      workwoman, almost in rags, who was seeking, with the first dawn of
      morning, the means of earning her daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch had forgotten the crowd, to look only at her sister, whom she
      tenderly loved&mdash;only the more tenderly, that she thought her
      situation to be pitied. With her eyes fixed on the joyous and beautiful
      girl, her pale and gentle countenance expressed the most touching and
      painful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, as the brilliant glance of the Bacchanal Queen travelled
      along the crowd, it lighted on the sad features of Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister!&rdquo; exclaimed Cephyse&mdash;such was the name of the
      Bacchanal Queen&mdash;&ldquo;My sister!&rdquo;&mdash;and with one bound,
      light as a ballet-dancer, she sprang from her movable throne (which
      fortunately just happened to be stopping), and, rushing up to the
      hunchback, embraced her affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had passed so rapidly, that the companions of the Bacchanal
      Queen, still stupefied by the boldness of her perilous leap, knew not how
      to account for it; whilst the masks who surrounded Mother Bunch drew back
      in surprise, and the latter, absorbed in the delight of embracing her
      sister, whose caresses she returned, did not even think of the singular
      contrast between them, which was sure to soon excite the astonishment and
      hilarity of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cephyse was the first to think of this, and wishing to save her sister at
      least one humiliation, she turned towards the carriage, and said: &ldquo;Rose
      Pompon, throw me down my cloak; and, Ninny Moulin, open the door directly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having received the cloak, the Bacchanal Queen hastily wrapped it round
      her sister, before the latter could speak or move. Then, taking her by the
      hand, she said to her: &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, in alarm. &ldquo;Do not think of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must speak with you. I will get a private room, where we shall be
      alone. So make haste, dear little sister! Do not resist before all these
      people&mdash;but come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear of becoming a public sight decided Mother Bunch, who, confused
      moreover with the adventure, trembling and frightened, followed her sister
      almost mechanically, and was dragged by her into the carriage, of which
      Ninny Moulin had just opened the door. And so, with the cloak of the
      Bacchanal Queen covering Mother Bunch&rsquo;s poor garments and deformed
      figure, the crowd had nothing to laugh at, and only wondered what this
      meeting could mean, while the coaches pursued their way to the eating
      house in the Place du Chatelet.

      CHAPTER II. THE CONTRAST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome minutes after
      the meeting of Mother Bunch with the Bacchanal Queen, the two sisters were
      alone together in a small room in the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me kiss you again,&rdquo; said Cephyse to the young sempstress;
      &ldquo;at least now we are alone, you will not be afraid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the effort of the Bacchanal Queen to clasp Mother Bunch in her arms,
      the cloak fell from the form of the latter. At sight of those miserable
      garments, which she had hardly had time to observe on the Place du
      Chatelet, in the midst of the crowd, Cephyse clasped her hands, and could
      not repress an exclamation of painful surprise. Then, approaching her
      sister, that she might contemplate her more closely, she took her thin,
      icy palms between her own plump hands, and examined for some minutes, with
      increasing grief, the suffering, pale, unhappy creature, ground down by
      watching and privations, and half-clothed in a poor, patched cotton gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister! to see you thus!&rdquo; Unable to articulate another
      word, the Bacchanal Queen threw herself on the other&rsquo;s neck, and
      burst into tears. Then, in the midst of her sobs, she added: &ldquo;Pardon!
      pardon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, my dear Cephyse?&rdquo; said the young
      sewing-girl, deeply moved, and gently disengaging herself from the embrace
      of her sister. &ldquo;Why do you ask my pardon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; resumed Cephyse, raising her countenance, bathed in
      tears, and purple with shame; &ldquo;is it not shameful of me to be
      dressed in all this frippery, and throwing away so much money in follies,
      while you are thus miserably clad, and in need of everything&mdash;perhaps
      dying of want, for I have never seen your poor face look so pale and worn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be at ease, dear sister! I am not ill. I was up rather late last
      night, and that makes me a little pale&mdash;but pray do not cry&mdash;it
      grieves me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacchanal Queen had but just arrived, radiant in the midst of the
      intoxicated crowd, and yet it was Mother Bunch who was now employed in
      consoling her!
    </p>
    <p>
      An incident occurred, which made the contrast still more striking. Joyous
      cries were heard suddenly in the next apartment, and these words were
      repeated with enthusiasm: &ldquo;Long live the Bacchanal Queen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch trembled, and her eyes filled with tears, as she saw her
      sister with her face buried in her hands, as if overwhelmed with shame.
      &ldquo;Cephyse,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I entreat you not to grieve so.
      You will make me regret the delight of this meeting, which is indeed
      happiness to me! It is so long since I saw you! But tell me&mdash;what
      ails you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You despise me perhaps&mdash;you are right,&rdquo; said the
      Bacchanal Queen, drying her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despise you? for what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I lead the life I do, instead of having the courage to
      support misery along with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The grief of Cephyse was so heart-breaking, that Mother Bunch, always good
      and indulgent, wishing to console her, and raise her a little in her own
      estimation, said to her tenderly: &ldquo;In supporting it bravely for a
      whole year, my good Cephyse, you have had more merit and courage than I
      should have in bearing with it my whole life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister! do not say that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In simple truth,&rdquo; returned Mother Bunch, &ldquo;to what
      temptations is a creature like me exposed? Do I not naturally seek
      solitude, even as you seek a noisy life of pleasure? What wants have I? A
      very little suffices.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not always that little?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but, weak and sickly as I seem, I can endure some
      privations better than you could. Thus hunger produces in me a sort of
      numbness, which leaves me very feeble&mdash;but for you, robust and full
      of life, hunger is fury, is madness. Alas! you must remember how many
      times I have seen you suffering from those painful attacks, when work
      failed us in our wretched garret, and we could not even earn our four
      francs a week&mdash;so that we had nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing to eat&mdash;for
      our pride prevented us from applying to the neighbors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have preserved the right to that honest pride.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you as well! Did you not struggle as much as a human creature
      could? But strength fails at last&mdash;I know you well, Cephyse&mdash;it
      was hunger that conquered you; and the painful necessity of constant
      labor, which was yet insufficient to supply our common wants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could endure those privations&mdash;you endure them still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you compare me with yourself? Look,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch,
      taking her sister by the hand, and leading her to a mirror placed above a
      couch, &ldquo;look!&mdash;Dost think that God made you so beautiful,
      endowed you with such quick and ardent blood, with so joyous, animated,
      grasping a nature and with such taste and fondness for pleasure, that your
      youth might be spent in a freezing garret, hid from the sun, nailed
      constantly to your chair, clad almost in rags, and working without rest
      and without hope? No! for He has given us other wants than those of eating
      and drinking. Even in our humble condition, does not beauty require some
      little ornament? Does not youth require some movement, pleasure, gayety?
      Do not all ages call for relaxation and rest? Had you gained sufficient
      wages to satisfy hunger, to have a day or so&rsquo;s amusement in the
      week, after working every other day for twelve or fifteen hours, and to
      procure the neat and modest dress which so charming a face might naturally
      claim&mdash;you would never have asked for more, I am sure of it&mdash;you
      have told me as much a hundred times. You have yielded, therefore, to an
      irresistible necessity, because your wants are greater than mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied the Bacchanal Queen, with a pensive air;
      &ldquo;if I could but have gained eighteenpence a day, my life would have
      been quite different; for, in the beginning, sister, I felt cruelly
      humiliated to live at a man&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;it was inevitable, my dear Cephyse; I must pity, but
      cannot blame you. You did not choose your destiny; but, like me, you have
      submitted to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor sister!&rdquo; said Cephyse, embracing the speaker tenderly;
      &ldquo;you can encourage and console me in the midst of your own
      misfortunes, when I ought to be pitying you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch; &ldquo;God is just and
      good. If He has denied me many advantages, He has given me my joys, as you
      have yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joys?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and great ones&mdash;without which life would be too
      burdensome, and I should not have the courage to go through with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Cephyse, with emotion; &ldquo;you
      still know how to devote yourself for others, and that lightens your own
      sorrows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do what I can, but, alas! it is very little; yet when I succeed,&rdquo;
      added Mother Bunch, with a faint smile, &ldquo;I am as proud and happy as
      a poor little ant, who, after a great deal of trouble, has brought a big
      straw to the common nest. But do not let us talk any more of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I must, even at the risk of making you angry,&rdquo;
      resumed the Bacchanal Queen, timidly; &ldquo;I have something to propose
      to you which you once before refused. Jacques Rennepont has still, I
      think, some money left&mdash;we are spending it in follies&mdash;now and
      then giving a little to poor people we may happen to meet&mdash;I beg of
      you, let me come to your assistance&mdash;I see in your poor face, you
      cannot conceal it from me, that you are wearing yourself out with toil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, my dear Cephyse, I know your good heart; but I am not in
      want of anything. The little I gain is sufficient for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse me,&rdquo; said the Bacchanal Queen, sadly, &ldquo;because
      you know that my claim to this money is not honorable&mdash;be it so&mdash;I
      respect your scruples. But you will not refuse a service from Jacques; he
      has been a workman, like ourselves, and comrades should help each other.
      Accept it I beseech you, or I shall think you despise me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall think you despise me, if you insist any more upon it,
      my dear Cephyse,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, in a tone at once so mild and
      firm that the Bacchanal Queen saw that all persuasion would be in vain.
      She hung her head sorrowfully, and a tear again trickled down her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My refusal grieves you,&rdquo; said the other, taking her hand;
      &ldquo;I am truly sorry&mdash;but reflect&mdash;and you will understand
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the Bacchanal Queen, bitterly, after a
      moment&rsquo;s silence; &ldquo;you cannot accept assistance from my lover&mdash;it
      was an insult to propose it to you. There are positions in life so
      humiliating, that they soil even the good one wishes to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cephyse, I did not mean to hurt you&mdash;you know it well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! believe me,&rdquo; replied the Bacchanal Queen, &ldquo;gay and
      giddy as I am, I have sometimes moments of reflection, even in the midst
      of my maddest joy. Happily, such moments are rare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that the life I lead is hardly the thing; then resolve to ask
      Jacques for a small sum of money, just enough to subsist on for a year,
      and form the plan of joining you, and gradually getting to work again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is a good one; why not act upon it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, when about to execute this project, I examined myself
      sincerely, and my courage failed. I feel that I could never resume the
      habit of labor, and renounce this mode of life, sometimes rich, as to day,
      sometimes precarious,&mdash;but at least free and full of leisure, joyous
      and without care, and at worst a thousand times preferable to living upon
      four francs a week. Not that interest has guided me. Many times have I
      refused to exchange a lover, who had little or nothing, for a rich man,
      that I did not like. Nor have I ever asked anything for myself. Jacques
      has spent perhaps ten thousand francs the last three or four months, yet
      we only occupy two half-furnished rooms, because we always live out of
      doors, like the birds: fortunately, when I first loved him, he had nothing
      at all, and I had just sold some jewels that had been given me, for a
      hundred francs, and put this sum in the lottery. As mad people and fools
      are always lucky, I gained a prize of four thousand francs. Jacques was as
      gay, and light-headed, and full of fun as myself, so we said: &lsquo;We
      love each other very much, and, as long as this money lasts, we will keep
      up the racket; when we have no more, one of two things will happen&mdash;either
      we shall be tired of one another, and so part&mdash;or else we shall love
      each other still, and then, to remain together, we shall try and get work
      again; and, if we cannot do so, and yet will not part&mdash;a bushel of
      charcoal will do our business!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied! we have not come to that. We had still something
      left, when a kind of agent, who had paid court to me, but who was so ugly
      that I could not bear him for all his riches, knowing that I was living
      with Jacques asked me to&mdash;But why should I trouble you with all these
      details? In one word, he lent Jacques money, on some sort of a doubtful
      claim he had, as was thought, to inherit some property. It is with this
      money that we are amusing ourselves&mdash;as long as its lasts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Cephyse, instead of spending this money so foolishly,
      why not put it out to interest, and marry Jacques, since you love him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in the first place,&rdquo; replied the Bacchanal Queen,
      laughing, as her gay and thoughtless character resumed its ascendancy,
      &ldquo;to put money out to interest gives one no pleasure. All the
      amusement one has is to look at a little bit of paper, which one gets in
      exchange for the nice little pieces of gold, with which one can purchase a
      thousand pleasures. As for marrying, I certainly like Jacques better than
      I ever liked any one; but it seems to me, that, if we were married, all
      our happiness would end&mdash;for while he is only my lover, he cannot
      reproach me with what has passed&mdash;but, as my husband, he would be
      stare to upbraid me, sooner or later, and if my conduct deserves blame, I
      prefer giving it to myself, because I shall do it more tenderly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad girl that you are! But this money will not last forever. What
      is to be done next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards!&mdash;Oh! that&rsquo;s all in the moon. To-morrow seems
      to me as if it would not come for a hundred years. If we were always
      saying: &lsquo;We must die one day or the other&rsquo;&mdash;would life be
      worth having?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation between Cephyse and her sister was here again interrupted
      by a terrible uproar, above which sounded the sharp, shrill noise of Ninny
      Moulin&rsquo;s rattle. To this tumult succeeded a chorus of barbarous
      cries, in the midst of which were distinguishable these words, which shook
      the very windows: &ldquo;The Queen! the Bacchanal Queen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch started at this sudden noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only my court, who are getting impatient,&rdquo; said Cephyse&mdash;and
      this time she could laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried the sewing-girl, in alarm; &ldquo;if they
      were to come here in search of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;never fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen! do you not hear those steps? they are coming along the
      passage&mdash;they are approaching. Pray, sister, let me go out alone,
      without being seen by all these people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment the door was opened, and Cephyse, ran towards it. She saw in
      the passage a deputation headed by Ninny Moulin, who was armed with his
      formidable rattle, and followed by Rose-Pompon and Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bacchanal Queen! or I poison myself with a glass of water;&rdquo;
      cried Ninny Moulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bacchanal Queen! or I publish my banns of marriage with Ninny
      Moulin!&rdquo; cried little Rose-Pompon, with a determined air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bacchanal Queen! or the court will rise in arms, and carry her
      off by force!&rdquo; said another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;let us carry her off!&rdquo; repeated a formidable
      chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques, enter alone!&rdquo; said the Bacchanal Queen,
      notwithstanding these pressing summonses; then, addressing her court in a
      majestic tone, she added: &ldquo;In ten minutes, I shall be at your
      service&mdash;and then for a&mdash;of a time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the Bacchanal Queen,&rdquo; cried Dumoulin, shaking his
      rattle as he retired, followed by the deputation, whilst Sleepinbuff
      entered the room alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques,&rdquo; said Cephyse, &ldquo;this is my good sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enchanted to see you,&rdquo; said Jacques, cordially; &ldquo;the
      more so as you will give me some news of my friend Agricola. Since I began
      to play the rich man, we have not seen each other, but I like him as much
      as ever, and think him a good and worthy fellow. You live in the same
      house. How is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir! he and his family have had many misfortunes. He is in
      prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In prison!&rdquo; cried Cephyse.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola in prison! what for?&rdquo; said Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a trifling political offence. We had hoped to get him out on
      bail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; for five hundred francs it could be done,&rdquo; said
      Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, we have not been able; the person upon whom we
      relied&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacchanal Queen interrupted the speaker by saying to her lover:
      &ldquo;Do you hear, Jacques? Agricola in prison, for want of five hundred
      francs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure! I hear and understand all about it. No need of your
      winking. Poor fellow! he was the support of his mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes, sir&mdash;and it is the more distressing, as his father
      has but just returned from Russia, and his mother&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Sleepinbuff, interrupting, and giving Mother
      Bunch a purse; &ldquo;take this&mdash;all the expenses here have been paid
      beforehand&mdash;this is what remains of my last bag. You will find here
      some twenty-five or thirty Napoleons, and I cannot make a better use of them
      than to serve a comrade in distress. Give them to Agricola&rsquo;s father;
      he will take the necessary steps, and to-morrow Agricola will be at his
      forge, where I had much rather he should be than myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques, give me a kiss!&rdquo; said the Bacchanal Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, and afterwards, and again and again!&rdquo; said Jacques,
      joyously embracing the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch hesitated for a moment; but reflecting that, after all, this
      sum of money, which was about to be spent in follies, would restore life
      and happiness to the family of Agricola, and that hereafter these very
      five hundred francs, when returned to Jacques, might be of the greatest
      use to him, she resolved to accept this offer. She took the purse, and
      with tearful eyes, said to him: &ldquo;I will not refuse your kindness M.
      Jacques; you are so good and generous, Agricola&rsquo;s father will thus
      at least have one consolation, in the midst of heavy sorrows. Thanks! many
      thanks!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need to thank me; money was made for others as well as
      ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, without, the noise recommenced more furiously than ever, and Ninny
      Moulin&rsquo;s rattle sent forth the most doleful sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cephyse,&rdquo; said Sleepinbuff, &ldquo;they will break everything
      to pieces, if you do not return to them, and I have nothing left to pay
      for the damage. Excuse us,&rdquo; added he, laughing, &ldquo;but you see
      that royalty has its duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cephyse deeply moved, extended her arms to Mother Bunch, who threw herself
      into them, shedding sweet tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said she, to her sister, &ldquo;when shall I see
      you again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon&mdash;though nothing grieves me more than to see you in want,
      out of which I am not allowed to help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come, then, to see me? It is a promise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you in her name,&rdquo; said Jacques; &ldquo;we will pay
      a visit to you and your neighbor Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to the company, Cephyse, and amuse yourself with a light
      heart, for M. Jacques has made a whole family happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and after Sleepinbuff had ascertained that she could go down
      without being seen by his noisy and joyous companions, Mother Bunch
      quietly withdrew, eager to carry one piece of good news at least to
      Dagobert; but intending, first of all, to go to the Rue de Babylone, to
      the garden-house formerly occupied by Adrienne de Cardoville. We shall
      explain hereafter the cause of this determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girl quitted the eating-house, three men plainly and comfortably
      dressed, were watching before it, and talking in a low voice. Soon after,
      they were joined by a fourth person, who rapidly descended the stairs of
      the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the three first, with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there two Sleepers-in-buff on earth?&rdquo; replied the other.
      &ldquo;I have just seen him; he is togged out like one of the swell mob.
      They will be at table for three hours at least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then wait for me, you others. Keep as quiet as possible. I will go
      and fetch the captain, and the game is bagged.&rdquo; So saying, one of
      the three men walked off quickly, and disappeared in a street leading from
      the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this same instant the Bacchanal Queen entered the banqueting-room,
      accompanied by Jacques, and was received with the most frenzied
      acclamations from all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; cried Cephyse, with a sort of feverish excitement,
      as if she wished to stun herself; &ldquo;now then, friends&mdash;noise and
      tumult, hurricane and tempest, thunder and earthquake&mdash;as much as you
      please!&rdquo; Then, holding out her glass to Ninny Moulin, she added:
      &ldquo;Pour out! pour out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the Queen!&rdquo; cried they all, with one voice.

      CHAPTER III. THE CAROUSE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Bacchanal
      Queen, having Sleepinbuff and Rose-Pompon opposite her, and Ninny Moulin
      on her right hand, presided at the repast, called a reveille-matin
      (wake-morning), generously offered by Jacques to his companions in
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both young men and girls seemed to have forgotten the fatigues of a ball,
      begun at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and finished at six in the
      morning; and all these couples, joyous as they were amorous and
      indefatigable, laughed, ate, and drank, with youthful and Pantagruelian
      ardor, so that, during the first part of the feast, there was less chatter
      than clatter of plates and glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacchanal Queen&rsquo;s countenance was less gay, but much more
      animated than usual; her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes announced a
      feverish excitement; she wished to drown reflection, cost what it might.
      Her conversation with her sister often recurred to her, and she tried to
      escape from such sad remembrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques regarded Cephyse from time to time with passionate adoration; for,
      thanks to the singular conformity of character, mind, and taste between
      him and the Bacchanal Queen, their attachment had deeper and stronger
      roots than generally belong to ephemeral connections founded upon
      pleasure. Cephyse and Jacques were themselves not aware of all the power
      of a passion which till now had been surrounded only by joys and
      festivities, and not yet been tried by any untoward event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Rose-Pompon, left a widow a few days before by a student, who, in
      order to end the carnival in style, had gone into the country to raise
      supplies from his family, under one of those fabulous pretences which
      tradition carefully preserves in colleges of law and medicine&mdash;Rose
      Pompon, we repeat, an example of rare fidelity, determined not to
      compromise herself, had taken for a chaperon the inoffensive Ninny Moulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter, having doffed his helmet, exhibited a bald head, encircled by
      a border of black, curling hair, pretty long at the back of the head. By a
      remarkable Bacchic phenomenon, in proportion as intoxication gained upon
      him, a sort of zone, as purple as his jovial face, crept by degrees over
      his brow, till it obscured even the shining whiteness of his crown.
      Rose-Pompon, who knew the meaning of this symptom, pointed it out to the
      company, and exclaimed with a loud burst of laughter: &ldquo;Take care,
      Ninny Moulin! the tide of the wine is coming in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it rises above his head he will be drowned,&rdquo; added the
      Bacchanal Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Queen! don&rsquo;t disturb me; I am meditating, answered
      Dumoulin, who was getting tipsy. He held in his hand, in the fashion of an
      antique goblet, a punch-bowl filled with wine, for he despised the
      ordinary glasses, because of their small size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meditating,&rdquo; echoed Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;Ninny Moulin is
      meditating. Be attentive!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is meditating; he must be ill then!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he meditating? an illegal dance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forbidden Anacreontic attitude?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am meditating,&rdquo; returned Dumoulin, gravely; &ldquo;I
      am meditating upon wine, generally and in particular&mdash;wine, of which
      the immortal Bossuet&rdquo;&mdash;Dumoulin had the very bad habit of
      quoting Bossuet when he was drunk&mdash;&ldquo;of which the immortal
      Bossuet says (and he was a judge of good liquor): &lsquo;In wine is
      courage, strength joy, and spiritual fervor&rsquo;&mdash;when one has any
      brains,&rdquo; added Ninny Moulin, by way of parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my! how I adore your Bossuet!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for my particular meditation, it concerns the question, whether
      the wine at the marriage of Cana was red or white. Sometimes I incline to
      one side, sometimes to the other&mdash;and sometimes to both at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is going to the bottom of the question,&rdquo; said
      Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, above all, to the bottom of the bottles,&rdquo; added the
      Bacchanal Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your majesty is pleased to observe; and already, by dint of
      reflection and research, I have made a great discovery&mdash;namely, that,
      if the wine at the marriage of Cana was red&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a&rsquo; been white,&rdquo; said
      Rose-Pompon, judiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I had arrived at the conviction that it was neither white
      nor red?&rdquo; asked Dumoulin, with a magisterial air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That could only be when you had drunk till all was blue,&rdquo;
      observed Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The partner of the Queen says well. One may be too athirst for
      science; but never mind! From all my studies on this question, to which I
      have devoted my life&mdash;I shall await the end of my respectable career
      with the sense of having emptied tuns with a historical&mdash;theological&mdash;and
      archeological tone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the jovial grimace and tone with which
      Dumoulin pronounced and accentuated these last words, which provoked a
      general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archieolopically?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon. &ldquo;What sawnee is
      that? Has he a tail? does he live in the water?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; observed the Bacchanal Queen; &ldquo;these are
      words of wise men and conjurers; they are like horsehair bustles&mdash;they
      serve for filling out&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. I like better to drink; so
      fill the glasses, Ninny Moulin; some champagne, Rose-Pompon; here&rsquo;s
      to the health of your Philemon and his speedy return!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to the success of his plant upon his stupid and stingy family!&rdquo;
      added Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toast was received with unanimous applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the permission of her majesty and her court,&rdquo; said
      Dumoulin, &ldquo;I propose a toast to the success of a project which
      greatly interests me, and has some resemblance to Philemon&rsquo;s
      jockeying. I fancy that the toast will bring me luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it, by all means!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;success to my marriage!&rdquo; said Dumoulin,
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words provoked an explosion of shouts, applause, and laughter. Ninny
      Moulin shouted, applauded, laughed even louder than the rest, opening wide
      his enormous mouth, and adding to the stunning noise the harsh springing
      of his rattle, which he had taken up from under his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the storm had somewhat subsided, the Bacchanal Queen rose and said:
      &ldquo;I drink to the health of the future Madame Ninny Moulin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Queen! your courtesy touches me so sensibly that I must allow
      you to read in the depths of my heart the name of my future spouse,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Dumoulin. &ldquo;She is called Madame
      Honoree-Modeste-Messaline-Angele de la Sainte-Colombe, widow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! bravo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is sixty years old, and has more thousands of francs-a-year
      than she has hair in her gray moustache or wrinkles on her face; she is so
      superbly fat that one of her gowns would serve as a tent for this
      honorable company. I hope to present my future spouse to you on Shrove
      Tuesday, in the costume of a shepherdess that has just devoured her flock.
      Some of them wish to convert her&mdash;but I have undertaken to divert
      her, which she will like better. You must help me to plunge her headlong
      into all sorts of skylarking jollity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will plunge her into anything you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall dance like sixty!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, humming a
      popular tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will overawe the police.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can say to them: &lsquo;Respect this lady; your mother will
      perhaps be as old some day!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the Bacchanal Queen rose; her countenance wore a singular
      expression of bitter and sardonic delight. In one hand she held a glass
      full to the brim. &ldquo;I hear the Cholera is approaching in his
      seven-league boots,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I drink luck to the Cholera!&rdquo;
      And she emptied the bumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the general gayety, these words made a gloomy impression;
      a sort of electric shudder ran through the assemblage, and nearly every
      countenance became suddenly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cephyse!&rdquo; said Jacques, in a tone of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luck to the Cholera,&rdquo; repeated the Queen, fearlessly. &ldquo;Let
      him spare those who wish to live, and kill together those who dread to
      part!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques and Cephyse exchanged a rapid glance, unnoticed by their joyous
      companions, and for some time the Bacchanal Queen remained silent and
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you put it that way, it is different,&rdquo; cried Rose-Pompon,
      boldly. &ldquo;To the Cholera! may none but good fellows be left on earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this variation, the impression was still painfully impressive.
      Dumoulin, wishing to cut short this gloomy subject, exclaimed: &ldquo;Devil
      take the dead, and long live the living! And, talking of chaps who both
      live and live well, I ask you to drink a health most dear to our joyous
      queen, the health of our Amphitryon. Unfortunately, I do not know his
      respectable name, having only had the advantage of making his acquaintance
      this night; he will excuse me, then, if I confine myself to proposing the
      health of Sleepinbuff&mdash;a name by no means offensive to my modesty, as
      Adam never slept in any other manner. I drink to Sleepinbuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, old son!&rdquo; said Jacques, gayly; &ldquo;were I to
      forget your name, I should call you &lsquo;Have-a-sip?&rsquo; and I am
      sure that you would answer: &lsquo;I will.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will directly!&rdquo; said Dumoulin, making the military salute
      with one hand, and holding out the bowl with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we have drunk together,&rdquo; resumed Sleepinbuff, cordially,
      &ldquo;we ought to know each other thoroughly. I am Jacques Rennepont?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rennepont!&rdquo; cried Dumoulin, who appeared struck by the name,
      in spite of his half-drunkenness; &ldquo;you are Rennepont?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rennepont in the fullest sense of the word. Does that astonish you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a very ancient family of that name&mdash;the Counts of
      Rennepont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce there is!&rdquo; said the other, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Counts of Rennepont are also Dukes of Cardoville,&rdquo; added
      Dumoulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, come, old fellow! do I look as if I belonged to such a family?&mdash;I,
      a workman out for a spree?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a workman? why, we are getting into the Arabian Nights!&rdquo;
      cried Dumoulin, more and more surprised. &ldquo;You give us a Belshazzar&rsquo;s
      banquet, with accompaniment of carriages and four, and yet are a workman?
      Only tell me your trade, and I will join you, leaving the Vine of the
      Divine to take care of itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I say! don&rsquo;t think that I am a printer of flimsies, and
      a smasher!&rdquo; replied Jacques, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, comrade! no such suspicion&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be excusable, seeing the rigs I run. But I&rsquo;ll make
      you easy on that point. I am spending an inheritance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eating and drinking an uncle, no doubt?&rdquo; said Dumoulin,
      benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you don&rsquo;t know whom you are eating and drinking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, in the first place, my father was a bone-grubber.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil he was!&rdquo; said Dumoulin, somewhat out of
      countenance, though in general not over-scrupulous in the choice of his
      bottle-companions: but, after the first surprise, he resumed, with the
      most charming amenity: &ldquo;There are some rag-pickers very high by
      scent&mdash;I mean descent!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure! you may think to laugh at me,&rdquo; said Jacques,
      &ldquo;but you are right in this respect, for my father was a man of very
      great merit. He spoke Greek and Latin like a scholar, and often told me
      that he had not his equal in mathematics; besides, he had travelled a good
      deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; resumed Dumoulin, whom surprise had partly
      sobered, &ldquo;you may belong to the family of the Counts of Rennepont,
      after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, laughing, &ldquo;your
      father was not a gutter-snipe by trade, but only for the honor of the
      thing.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;worse luck! it was to earn his living,&rdquo; replied
      Jacques; &ldquo;but, in his youth, he had been well off. By what appeared,
      or rather by what did not appear, he had applied to some rich relation,
      and the rich relation had said to him: &lsquo;Much obliged! try the work&rsquo;us.&rsquo;
      Then he wished to make use of his Greek, and Latin, and mathematics.
      Impossible to do anything&mdash;Paris, it seems, being choke-full of
      learned men&mdash;so my father had to look for his bread at the end of a
      hooked stick, and there, too, he must have found it, for I ate of it
      during two years, when I came to live with him after the death of an aunt,
      with whom I had been staying in the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your respectable father must have been a sort of philosopher,&rdquo;
      said Dumoulin; &ldquo;but, unless he found an inheritance in a dustbin, I
      don&rsquo;t see how you came into your property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for the end of the song. At twelve years of age I was an
      apprentice at the factory of M. Tripeaud; two years afterwards, my father
      died of an accident, leaving me the furniture of our garret&mdash;a
      mattress, a chair, and a table&mdash;and, moreover, in an old Eau de
      Cologne box, some papers (written, it seems, in English), and a bronze
      medal, worth about ten sous, chain and all. He had never spoken to me of
      these papers, so, not knowing if they were good for anything, I left them
      at the bottom of an old trunk, instead of burning them&mdash;which was
      well for me, since it is upon these papers that I have had money advanced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a godsend!&rdquo; said Dumoulin. &ldquo;But somebody must have
      known that you had them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; one of those people that are always looking out for old debts
      came to Cephyse, who told me all about it; and, after he had read the
      papers, he said that the affair was doubtful, but that he would lend me
      ten thousand francs on it, if I liked. Ten thousand francs was a large
      sum, so I snapped him up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have supposed that these old papers were of great
      value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, no! since my father, who ought to have known their value,
      had never realized on them&mdash;and then, you see, ten thousand francs in
      good, bright coin, falling as it were from the clouds, are not to be
      sneezed at&mdash;so I took them&mdash;only the man made me do a bit of
      stiff as guarantee, or something of that kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you sign it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;what did I care about it? The man told me it was
      only a matter of form. He spoke the truth, for the bill fell due a
      fortnight ago, and I have heard nothing of it. I have still about a
      thousand francs in his hands, for I have taken him for my banker. And that&rsquo;s
      the way, old pal, that I&rsquo;m able to flourish and be jolly all day
      long, as pleased as Punch to have left my old grinder of a master, M.
      Tripeaud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced this name, the joyous countenance of Jacques became
      suddenly overcast. Cephyse, no longer under the influence of the painful
      impression she had felt for a moment, looked uneasily at Jacques, for she
      knew the irritation which the name of M. Tripeaud produced within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Tripeaud,&rdquo; resumed Sleepinbuff, &ldquo;is one that would
      make the good bad, and the bad worse. They say that a good rider makes a
      good horse; they ought to say that a good master makes a good workman.
      Zounds! when I think of that fellow!&rdquo; cried Sleepinbuff, striking
      his hand violently on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Jacques&mdash;think of something else!&rdquo; said the
      Bacchanal Queen. &ldquo;Make him laugh, Rose-Pompon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in a humor to laugh,&rdquo; replied Jacques, abruptly, for
      he was getting excited from the effects of the wine; &ldquo;it is more
      than I can bear to think of that man. It exasperates me! it drives me mad!
      You should have heard him saying: &lsquo;Beggarly workmen! rascally
      workmen! they grumble that they have no food in their bellies; well, then,
      we&rsquo;ll give them bayonets to stop their hunger.&lsquo;(11) And there&rsquo;s
      the children in his factory&mdash;you should see them, poor little
      creatures!&mdash;working as long as the men&mdash;wasting away, and dying
      by the dozen&mdash;what odds? as soon as they were dead plenty of others
      came to take their places&mdash;not like horses, which can only be
      replaced with money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is clear, that you do not like your old master,&rdquo;
      said Dumoulin, more and more surprised at his Amphitryon&rsquo;s gloomy
      and thoughtful air, and, regretting that the conversation had taken this
      serious turn, he whispered a few words in the ear of the Bacchanal Queen,
      who answered by a sign of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like M. Tripeaud!&rdquo; exclaimed Jacques. &ldquo;I
      hate him&mdash;and shall I tell you why? Because it is as much his fault
      as mine, that I have become a good-for-nothing loafer. I don&rsquo;t say
      it to screen myself; but it is the truth. When I was &lsquo;prenticed to
      him as a lad, I was all heart and ardor, and so bent upon work, that I
      used to take my shirt off to my task, which, by the way, was the reason
      that I was first called Sleepinbuff. Well! I might have toiled myself to
      death; not one word of encouragement did I receive. I came first to my
      work, and was the last to leave off; what matter? it was not even noticed.
      One day, I was injured by the machinery. I was taken to the hospital. When
      I came out, weak as I was, I went straight to my work; I was not to be
      frightened; the others, who knew their master well, would often say to me:
      &lsquo;What a muff you must be, little one! What good will you get by
      working so hard?&rsquo;&mdash;still I went on. But, one day, a worthy old
      man, called Father Arsene, who had worked in the house many years, and was
      a model of good conduct, was suddenly turned away, because he was getting
      too feeble. It was a death-blow to him; his wife was infirm, and, at his
      age, he could not get another place. When the foreman told him he was
      dismissed, he could not believe it, and he began to cry for grief. At that
      moment, M. Tripeaud passes; Father Arsene begs him with clasped hands to
      keep him at half-wages. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; says M. Tripeaud, shrugging
      his shoulders; &lsquo;do you think that I will turn my factory into a
      house of invalids? You are no longer able to work&mdash;so be off!&rsquo;
      &lsquo;But I have worked forty years of my life; what is to become of me?&rsquo;
      cried poor Father Arsene. &lsquo;That is not my business,&rsquo; answered
      M. Tripeaud; and, addressing his clerk, he added: &lsquo;Pay what is due
      for the week, and let him cut his stick.&rsquo; Father Arsene did cut his
      stick; that evening, he and his old wife suffocated themselves with
      charcoal. Now, you see, I was then a lad; but that story of Father Arsene
      taught me, that, however hard you might work, it would only profit your
      master, who would not even thank you for it, and leave you to die on the
      flags in your old age. So all my fire was damped, and I said to myself:
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of doing more than I just need? If I gain
      heaps of gold for M. Tripeaud, shall I get an atom of it?&rsquo;
      Therefore, finding neither pride nor profit in my work, I took a disgust
      for it&mdash;just did barely enough to earn my wages&mdash;became an idler
      and a rake&mdash;and said to myself: &lsquo;When I get too tired of labor,
      I can always follow the example of Father Arsene and his wife.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Jacques resigned himself to the current of these bitter thoughts,
      the other guests, incited by the expressive pantomime of Dumoulin and the
      Bacchanal Queen, had tacitly agreed together; and, on a signal from the
      Queen, who leaped upon the table, and threw down the bottles and glasses
      with her foot, all rose and shouted, with the accompaniment of Ninny
      Moulin&rsquo;s rattle &ldquo;The storm blown Tulip! the quadrille of the
      Storm-blown Tulip!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these joyous cries, which burst suddenly, like shell, Jacques started;
      then gazing with astonishment at his guests, he drew his hand across his
      brow, as if to chase away the painful ideas that oppressed him, and
      exclaimed: &ldquo;You are right. Forward the first couple! Let us be
      merry!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment, the table, lifted by vigorous arms, was removed to the
      extremity of the banqueting-room; the spectators, mounted upon chairs,
      benches, and window-ledges, began to sing in chorus the well-known air of
      les Etudiants, so as to serve instead of orchestra, and accompany the
      quadrille formed by Sleepinbuff, the Queen, Ninny Moulin, and Rose Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumoulin, having entrusted his rattle to one of the guests, resumed his
      extravagant Roman helmet and plume; he had taken off his great-coat at the
      commencement of the feast, so that he now appeared in all the splendor of
      his costume. His cuirass of bright scales ended in a tunic of feathers,
      not unlike those worn by the savages, who form the oxen&rsquo;s escort on
      Mardi Gras. Ninny Moulin had a huge paunch and thin legs, so that the
      latter moved about at pleasure in the gaping mouths of his large top
      boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Rose-Pompon, with her pinched-up cocked-hat stuck on one side, her
      hands in the pockets of her trousers, her bust a little inclined forward,
      and undulating from right to left, advanced to meet Ninny-Moulin; the
      latter danced, or rather leaped towards her, his left leg bent under him,
      his right leg stretched forward, with the toe raised, and the heel gliding
      on the floor; moreover, he struck his neck with his left hand, and by a
      simultaneous movement, stretched forth his right, as if he would have
      thrown dust in the eyes of his opposite partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first figure met with great success, and the applause was vociferous,
      though it was only the innocent prelude to the step of the Storm-blown
      Tulip&mdash;when suddenly the door opened, and one of the waiters, after
      looking about for an instant, in search of Sleepinbuff, ran to him, and
      whispered some words in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Jacques, laughing; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter added a few more words, when Sleepinbuff&rsquo;s face assumed
      an expression of uneasiness, as he answered. &ldquo;Very well! I come
      directly,&rdquo;&mdash;and he made a step towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jacques?&rdquo; asked the Bacchanal Queen,
      in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back immediately. Some one take my place. Go on with
      the dance,&rdquo; said Sleepinbuff, as he hastily left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something, that was not put down in the bill,&rdquo; said Dumoulin;
      &ldquo;he will soon be back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Cephyse. &ldquo;Now cavalier suel!&rdquo;
      she added, as she took Jacques&rsquo;s place, and the dance continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ninny Moulin had just taken hold of Rose Pompon with his right hand, and
      of the Queen with his left, in order to advance between the two, in which
      figure he showed off his buffoonery to the utmost extent, when the door
      again opened, and the same waiter, who had called out Jacques, approached
      Cephyse with an air of consternation, and whispered in her ear, as he had
      before done to Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacchanal Queen grew pale, uttered a piercing scream, and rushed out
      of the room without a word, leaving her guests in stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      (11) These atrocious words were actually spoken during the Lyons Riots.

      CHAPTER IV. THE FAREWELL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Bacchanal
      Queen, following the waiter, arrived at the bottom of the staircase. A
      coach was standing before the door of the house. In it she saw
      Sleepinbuff, with one of the men who, two hours before, had been waiting
      on the Place du Chatelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of Cephyse, the man got down, and said to Jacques, as he
      drew out his watch: &ldquo;I give you a quarter of an hour; it is all that
      I can do for you, my good fellow; after that we must start. Do not try to
      escape, for we&rsquo;ll be watching at the coach doors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With one spring, Cephyse was in the coach. Too much overcome to speak
      before, she now exclaimed, as she took her seat by Jacques, and remarked
      the paleness of his countenance: &ldquo;What is it? What do they want with
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am arrested for debt,&rdquo; said Jacques, in a mournful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Cephyse, with a heart-rending sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for that bill, or guarantee, they made me sign. And yet the
      man said it was only a form&mdash;the rascal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have money in his hands; let him take that on account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not a copper; he sends me word by the bailiff, that not
      having paid the bill, I shall not have the last thousand francs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us go to him, and entreat him to leave you at liberty. It
      was he who came to propose to lend you this money. I know it well, as he
      first addressed himself to me. He will have pity on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity?&mdash;a money broker pity? No! no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there then no hope? none?&rdquo; cried Cephyse clasping her
      hands in anguish. &ldquo;But there must be something done,&rdquo; she
      resumed. &ldquo;He promised you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see how he keeps his promises,&rdquo; answered Jacques,
      with bitterness. &ldquo;I signed, without even knowing what I signed. The
      bill is over-due; everything is in order, it would be vain to resist. They
      have just explained all that to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they cannot keep you long in prison. It is impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years, if I do not pay. As I&rsquo;ll never be able to do so,
      my fate is certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a misfortune! and not to be able to do anything!&rdquo;
      said Cephyse, hiding her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Cephyse,&rdquo; resumed Jacques, in a voice of
      mournful emotion; &ldquo;since I am here, I have thought only of one thing&mdash;what
      is to become of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mind you?&mdash;art mad? What will you do? The furniture of our
      two rooms is not worth two hundred francs. We have squandered our money so
      foolishly, that we have not even paid our rent. We owe three quarters, and
      we must not therefore count upon the furniture. I leave you without a
      coin. At least I shall be fed in prison&mdash;but how will you manage to
      live?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of grieving beforehand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you how you will live to-morrow?&rdquo; cried Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sell my costume, and some other clothes. I will send you
      half the money, and keep the rest. That will last some days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterwards?&mdash;afterwards?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards?&mdash;why, then&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;how can
      I tell you! Afterwards&mdash;I&rsquo;ll look about me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, Cephyse,&rdquo; resumed Jacques, with bitter agony.
      &ldquo;It is now that I first know how mach I love you. My heart is
      pressed as in a vise at the thought of leaving you and I shudder to thinly
      what is to become of you.&rdquo; Then&mdash;drawing his hand across his
      forehead, Jacques added: &ldquo;You see we have been ruined by saying&mdash;&lsquo;To-morrow
      will never come!&rsquo;&mdash;for to morrow has come. When I am no longer
      with you, and you have spent the last penny of the money gained by the
      sale of your clothes&mdash;unfit for work as you have become&mdash;what
      will you do next? Must I tell you what you will do!&mdash;you will forget
      me and&mdash;&rdquo; Then, as if he recoiled from his own thoughts,
      Jacques exclaimed, with a burst of rage and despair&mdash;&ldquo;Great
      Heaven! if that were to happen, I should dash my brains out against the
      stones!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cephyse guessed the half-told meaning of Jacques, and throwing her arms
      around his neck, she said to him: &ldquo;I take another lover?&mdash;never!
      I am like you, for I now first know how much I love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my poor Cephyse&mdash;how will you live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall take courage. I will go back and dwell, with my
      sister, as in old times; we will work together, and so earn our bread. I&rsquo;ll
      never go out, except to visit you. In a few days your creditor will
      reflect, that, as you can&rsquo;t pay him ten thousand francs, he may as
      well set you free. By that time I shall have once more acquired the habit
      of working. You shall see, you shall see!&mdash;and you also will again
      acquire this habit. We shall live poor, but content. After all, we have
      had plenty of amusement for six month, while so many others have never
      known pleasure all their lives. And believe me, my dear Jacques, when I
      say to you&mdash;I shall profit by this lesson. If you love me, do not
      feel the least uneasiness; I tell you, that I would rather die a hundred
      times, than have another lover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; said Jacques, with eyes full of tears. &ldquo;I
      believe you&mdash;yes, I believe you&mdash;and you give me back my
      courage, both for now and hereafter. You are right; we must try and get to
      work again, or else nothing remains but Father Arsene&rsquo;s bushel of
      charcoal; for, my girl,&rdquo; added Jacques, in a low and trembling
      voice, &ldquo;I have been like a drunken man these six months, and now I
      am getting sober, and see whither we are going. Our means once exhausted,
      I might perhaps have become a robber, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jacques! don&rsquo;t talk so&mdash;it is frightful,&rdquo;
      interrupted Cephyse; &ldquo;I swear to you that I will return to my sister&mdash;that
      I will work&mdash;that I will have courage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, the Bacchanal Queen was very sincere; she fully intended to
      keep her word, for her heart was not yet completely corrupted. Misery and
      want had been with her, as with so many others, the cause and the excuse
      of her worst errors. Until now, she had at least followed the instincts of
      her heart, without regard to any base or venal motive. The cruel position
      in which she beheld Jacques had so far exalted her love, that she believed
      herself capable of resuming, along with Mother Bunch, that life of sterile
      and incessant toil, full of painful sacrifices and privations, which once
      had been impossible for her to bear, and which the habits of a life of
      leisure and dissipation would now render still more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the assurances which she had just given Jacques calmed his grief
      and anxiety a little; he had sense and feeling enough to perceive that the
      fatal track which he had hitherto so blindly followed was leading both him
      and Cephyse directly to infamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the bailiffs, having knocked at the coach-door, said to Jacques:
      &ldquo;My lad, you have only five minutes left&mdash;so make haste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, courage, my girl&mdash;courage!&rdquo; said Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will; you may rely upon me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going upstairs again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh no!&rdquo; said Cephyse. &ldquo;I have now a horror of
      this festivity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is paid for, and the waiter will tell them not to expect
      us back. They will be much astonished,&rdquo; continued Jacques, &ldquo;but
      it&rsquo;s all the same now.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could only go with me to our lodging,&rdquo; said Cephyse,
      &ldquo;this man would perhaps permit it, so as not to enter Sainte-Pelagie
      in that dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he will not forbid you to accompany me; but, as he will be with
      us in the coach, we shall not be able to talk freely in his presence.
      Therefore, let me speak reason to you for the first time in my life.
      Remember what I say, my dear Cephyse&mdash;and the counsel will apply to
      me as well as to yourself,&rdquo; continued Jacques, in a grave and
      feeling tone&mdash;&ldquo;resume from to-day the habit of labor. It may be
      painful, unprofitable&mdash;never mind&mdash;do not hesitate, for too soon
      will the influence of this lesson be forgotten. By-and-bye it will be too
      late, and then you will end like so many unfortunate creatures&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Cephyse, blushing; &ldquo;but I will
      rather die than lead such a life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there you will do well&mdash;for in that case,&rdquo; added
      Jacques, in a deep and hollow voice, &ldquo;I will myself show you how to
      die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I count upon you, Jacques,&rdquo; answered Cephyse, embracing her
      lover with excited feeling; then she added, sorrowfully: &ldquo;It was a
      kind of presentiment, when just now I felt so sad, without knowing why, in
      the midst of all our gayety&mdash;and drank to the Cholera, so that we
      might die together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! perhaps the Cholera will come,&rdquo; resumed Jacques, with a
      gloomy air; &ldquo;that would save us the charcoal, which we may not even
      be able to buy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only tell you one thing, Jacques, that to live and die
      together, you will always find me ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dry your eyes,&rdquo; said he, with profound emotion. &ldquo;Do
      not let us play the children before these men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes after, the coach took the direction to Jacques&rsquo;s
      lodging, where he was to change his clothes, before proceeding to the
      debtors&rsquo; prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us repeat, with regard to the hunchback&rsquo;s sister&mdash;for there
      are things which cannot be too often repeated&mdash;that one of the most
      fatal consequences of the Inorganization of Labor is the Insufficiency of
      Wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insufficiency of wages forces inevitably the greater number of young
      girls, thus badly paid, to seek their means of subsistence in connections
      which deprave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they receive a small allowance from their lovers, which, joined
      to the produce of their labor, enables them to live. Sometimes like the
      sempstress&rsquo;s sister, they throw aside their work altogether, and
      take up their abode with the man of their choice, should he be able to
      support the expense. It is during this season of pleasure and idleness
      that the incurable leprosy of sloth takes lasting possession of these
      unfortunate creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first phase of degradation that the guilty carelessness of
      Society imposes on an immense number of workwomen, born with instincts of
      modesty, and honesty, and uprightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a certain time they are deserted by their seducers&mdash;perhaps
      when they are mothers. Or, it may be, that foolish extravagance consigns
      the imprudent lover to prison, and the young girl finds herself alone,
      abandoned, without the means of subsistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have still preserved courage and energy go back to their work&mdash;but
      the examples are very rare. The others, impelled by misery, and by habits
      of indolence, fall into the lowest depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet we must pity, rather than blame them, for the first and virtual
      cause of their fall has been the insufficient remuneration of labor and
      sudden reduction of pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another deplorable consequence of this inorganization is the disgust which
      workmen feel for their employment, in addition to the insufficiency of
      their wages. And this is quite conceivable, for nothing is done to render
      their labor attractive, either by variety of occupations, or by honorary
      rewards, or by proper care, or by remuneration proportionate to the
      benefits which their toil provides, or by the hope of rest after long
      years of industry. No&mdash;the country thinks not, cares not, either for
      their wants or their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, to take only one example, machinists and workers in foundries,
      exposed to boiler explosions, and the contact of formidable engines, run
      every day greater dangers than soldiers in time of war, display rare
      practical sagacity, and render to industry&mdash;and, consequently, to
      their country&mdash;the most incontestable service, during a long and
      honorable career, if they do not perish by the bursting of a boiler, or
      have not their limbs crushed by the iron teeth of a machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this last case, does the workman receive a recompense equal to that
      which awaits the soldier&rsquo;s praiseworthy, but sterile courage&mdash;a
      place in an asylum for invalids? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does the country care about it? And if the master should happen to be
      ungrateful, the mutilated workman, incapable of further service, may die
      of want in some corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in our pompous festivals of commerce, do we ever assemble any of
      the skillful workmen who alone have woven those admirable stuffs, forged
      and damascened those shining weapons, chiselled those goblets of gold and
      silver, carved the wood and ivory of that costly furniture, and set those
      dazzling jewels with such exquisite art? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the obscurity of their garrets, in the midst of a miserable and
      starving family, hardly able to subsist on their scanty wages, these
      workmen have contributed, at least, one half to bestow those wonders upon
      their country, which make its wealth, its glory, and its pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minister of commerce, who had the least intelligence of his high
      functions and duties, would require of every factory that exhibits on
      these occasions, the selection by vote of a certain number of candidates,
      amongst whom the manufacturer would point out the one that appeared most
      worthy to represent the working classes in these great industrial
      solemnities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it not be a noble and encouraging example to see the master propose
      for public recompense and distinction the workman, deputed by his peers,
      as amongst the most honest, laborious, and intelligent of his profession?
      Then one most grievous injustice would disappear, and the virtues of the
      workman would be stimulated by a generous and noble ambition&mdash;he
      would have an interest in doing well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless, the manufacturer himself, because of the intelligence he
      displays, the capital he risks, the establishment he founds, and the good
      he sometimes does, has a legitimate right to the prizes bestowed upon him.
      But why is the workman to be rigorously excluded from these rewards, which
      have so powerful an influence upon the people? Are generals and officers
      the only ones that receive rewards in the army? And when we have
      remunerated the captains of this great and powerful army of industry, why
      should we neglect the privates?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why for them is there no sign of public gratitude? no kind or consoling
      word from august lips? Why do we not see in France, a single workman
      wearing a medal as a reward for his courageous industry, his long and
      laborious career? The token and the little pension attached to it, would
      be to him a double recompense, justly deserved. But, no! for humble labor
      that sustains the State, there is only forgetfulness, injustice,
      indifference, and disdain!
    </p>
    <p>
      By this neglect of the public, often aggravated by individual selfishness
      and ingratitude, our workmen are placed in a deplorable situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them, notwithstanding their incessant toil, lead a life of
      privations, and die before their time cursing the social system that rides
      over them. Others find a temporary oblivion of their ills in destructive
      intoxication. Others again&mdash;in great number&mdash;having no interest,
      no advantage, no moral or physical inducement to do more or better,
      confine themselves strictly to just that amount of labor which will
      suffice to earn their wages. Nothing attaches them to their work, because
      nothing elevates, honors, glorifies it in their eyes. They have no defence
      against the reductions of indolence; and if, by some chance, they find
      means of living awhile in repose, they give way by degrees to habits of
      laziness and debauchery, and sometimes the worst passions soil forever
      natures originally willing, healthy and honest&mdash;and all for want of
      that protecting and equitable superintendence which should have sustained,
      encouraged, and recompensed their first worthy and laborious tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now follow Mother Bunch, who after seeking for work from the person
      that usually employed her, went to the Rue de Babylone, to the lodge
      lately occupied by Adrienne de Cardoville.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. FLORINE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the Bacchanal
      Queen and Sleepinbuff terminated so sadly the most joyous portion of their
      existence, the sempstress arrived at the door of the summer-house in the
      Rue de Babylone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before ringing she dried her tears; a new grief weighed upon her spirits.
      On quitting the tavern, she had gone to the house of the person who
      usually found her in work; but she was told that she could not have any
      because it could be done a third more cheaply by women in prison. Mother
      Bunch, rather than lose her last resource, offered to take it at the third
      less; but the linen had been already sent out; and the girl could not hope
      for employment for a fortnight to come, even if submitting to this
      reduction of wages. One may conceive the anguish of the poor creature; the
      prospect before her was to die of hunger, if she would not beg or steal.
      As for her visit to the lodge in the Rue de Babylone, it will be explained
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell timidly; a few minutes after, Florine opened the door to
      her. The waiting-maid was no longer adorned after the charming taste of
      Adrienne; on the contrary, she was dressed with an affectation of austere
      simplicity. She wore a high-necked dress of a dark color, made full enough
      to conceal the light elegance of her figure. Her bands of jet-black hair
      were hardly visible beneath the flat border of a starched white cap, very
      much resembling the head-dress of a nun. Yet, in spite of this
      unornamental costume, Florine&rsquo;s pale countenance was still admirably
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that, placed by former misconduct at the mercy of Rodin and
      M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, Florine had served them as a spy upon her mistress,
      notwithstanding the marks of kindness and confidence she had received from
      her. Yet Florine was not entirely corrupted; and she often suffered
      painful, but vain, remorse at the thought of the infamous part she was
      thus obliged to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of Mother Bunch, whom she recognized&mdash;for she had told
      her, the day before, of Agricola&rsquo;s arrest and Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s
      madness&mdash;Florine recoiled a step, so much was she moved with pity at
      the appearance of the young sempstress. In fact, the idea of being thrown
      out of work, in the midst of so many other painful circumstances, had made
      a terrible impression upon the young workwoman, the traces of recent tears
      furrowed her cheeks&mdash;without her knowing it, her features expressed
      the deepest despair&mdash;and she appeared so exhausted, so weak, so
      overcome, that Florine offered her arm to support her, and said to her
      kindly: &ldquo;Pray walk in and rest yourself; you are very pale, and seem
      to be ill and fatigued.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Florine led her into a small room; with fireplace and carpet,
      and made her sit down in a tapestried armchair by the side of a good fire.
      Georgette and Hebe had been dismissed, and Florine was left alone in care
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her guest was seated, Florine said to her with an air of interest:
      &ldquo;Will you not take anything? A little orange flower-water and sugar,
      warm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, with emotion,
      so easily was her gratitude excited by the least mark of kindness; she
      felt, too, a pleasing surprise, that her poor garments had not been the
      cause of repugnance or disdain on the part of Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I only
      require a little rest, for I come from a great distance. If you will
      permit me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray rest yourself as long as you like, mademoiselle; I am alone in
      this pavilion since the departure of my poor mistress,&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Florine blushed and sighed;&mdash;&ldquo;so, pray make yourself quite at
      home. Draw near the fire&mdash;you wilt be more comfortable&mdash;and,
      gracious! how wet your feet are!&mdash;place them upon this stool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cordial reception given by Florine, her handsome face and agreeable
      manners, which were not those of an ordinary waiting-maid, forcibly struck
      Mother Bunch, who, notwithstanding her humble condition, was peculiarly
      susceptible to the influence of everything graceful and delicate.
      Yielding, therefore, to these attractions, the young sempstress, generally
      so timid and sensitive, felt herself almost at her ease with Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How obliging you are, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said she in a grateful
      tone. &ldquo;I am quite confused with your kindness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20061m.jpg" alt="20061m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20061.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could do you some greater service than offer you a place
      at the fire, mademoiselle. Your appearance is so good and interesting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said the other, with simplicity, almost in
      spite of herself; &ldquo;it does one so much good to sit by a warm fire!&rdquo;
      Then, fearing, in her extreme delicacy, that she might be thought capable
      of abusing the hospitality of her entertainer, by unreasonably prolonging
      her visit, she added: &ldquo;the motive that has brought me here is this.
      Yesterday, you informed me that a young workman, named Agricola Baudoin,
      had been arrested in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes, mademoiselle. At the moment, too, when my poor mistress
      was about to render him assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Agricola&rsquo;s adopted sister,&rdquo; resumed Mother Bunch,
      with a slight blush; &ldquo;he wrote to me yesterday evening from prison.
      He begged me to tell his father to come here as soon as possible, in order
      to inform Mdlle. de Cardoville that he, Agricola, had important matters to
      communicate to her, or to any person that she might send; but that he
      could not venture to mention them in a letter, as he did not know if the
      correspondence of prisoners might not be read by the governor of the
      prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Florine, with surprise; &ldquo;to my mistress, M.
      Agricola has something of importance to communicate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle; for, up to this time, Agricola is ignorant of
      the great calamity that has befallen Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; the attack was indeed so sudden,&rdquo; said Florine, casting
      down her eyes, &ldquo;that no one could have foreseen it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been so,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch; &ldquo;for,
      when Agricola saw Mdlle. de Cardoville for the first time, he returned
      home, struck with her grace, and delicacy, and goodness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As were all who approached my mistress,&rdquo; said Florine,
      sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; resumed the sewing-girl, &ldquo;when,
      according to Agricola&rsquo;s instructions, I wished to speak to his
      father on the subject, I found him already gone out, for he also is a prey
      to great anxieties; but my adopted brother&rsquo;s letter appeared to me
      so pressing, and to involve something of such consequence to Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, who had shown herself so generous towards him, that I came
      here immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, as you already know, my mistress is no longer here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there no member of her family to whom, if I could not speak
      myself, I might at least send word by you, that Agricola has something to
      communicate of importance to this young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange!&rdquo; said Florine, reflecting, and without
      replying. Then, turning towards the sempstress, she added: &ldquo;You are
      quite ignorant of the nature of these revelations?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely so, mademoiselle; but I know Agricola. He is all honor
      and truth, and you may believe whatever he affirms. Besides, he would have
      no interest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; interrupted Florine, suddenly, as if struck
      with a sadden light; &ldquo;I have just remembered something. When he was
      arrested in a hiding-place where my mistress had concealed him, I happened
      to be close at hand, and M. Agricola said to me, in a quick whisper:
      &lsquo;Tell your generous mistress that her goodness to me will not go
      unrewarded, and that my stay in that hiding-place may not be useless to
      her.&rsquo; That was all he could say to me, for they hurried him off
      instantly. I confess that I saw in those words only the expression of his
      gratitude, and his hope of proving it one day to my mistress; but now that
      I connect them with the letter he has written you&mdash;&rdquo; said
      Florine, reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; remarked Mother Bunch, &ldquo;there is certainly
      some connection between his hiding-place here and the important secrets
      which he wishes to communicate to your mistress, or one of her family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hiding-place had neither been inhabited nor visited for some
      time,&rdquo; said Florine, with a thoughtful air; &ldquo;M. Agricola may
      have found therein something of interest to my mistress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his letter had not appeared to me so pressing,&rdquo; resumed
      the other, &ldquo;I should not have come hither; but have left him to do
      so himself, on his release from prison, which now, thanks to the
      generosity of one of his old fellow-workmen, cannot be very distant. But,
      not knowing if bail would be accepted to-day, I have wished faithfully to
      perform his instructions. The generous kindness of your mistress made it
      my first duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all persons whose better instincts are still roused from time to
      time, Florine felt a sort of consolation in doing good whenever she could
      with impunity&mdash;that is to say, without exposing herself to the
      inexorable resentments of those on whom she depended. Thanks to Mother
      Bunch, she might now have an opportunity of rendering a great service to
      her mistress. She knew enough of the Princess de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s
      hatred of her niece, to feel certain that Agricola&rsquo;s communication
      could not, from its very importance, be made with safety to any but Mdlle.
      de Cardoville herself. She therefore said very gravely: &ldquo;Listen to
      me, mademoiselle! I will give you a piece of advice which will, I think,
      be useful to my poor mistress&mdash;but which would be very fatal to me if
      you did not attend to my recommendations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, mademoiselle?&rdquo; said the hunchback, looking at Florine
      with extreme surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of my mistress, M. Agricola must confide to no one,
      except herself, the important things he has to communicate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if he cannot see Mdlle. Adrienne, may he not address himself
      to some of her family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is from her family, above all, that he must conceal whatever he
      knows. Mdlle. Adrienne may recover, and then M. Agricola can speak to her.
      But should she never get well again, tell your adopted brother that it is
      better for him to keep his secret than to place it (which would infallibly
      happen) at the disposal of the enemies of my mistress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, sadly.
      &ldquo;The family of your generous mistress do not love her, and perhaps
      persecute her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you more on this subject now; and, as regards myself,
      let me conjure you to obtain M. Agricola&rsquo;s promise that he will not
      mention to any one in the world the step you have taken, or the advice I
      have given you. The happiness&mdash;no, not the happiness,&rdquo; resumed
      Florine bitterly, as if that were a lost hope, &ldquo;not the happiness&mdash;but
      the peace of my life depends upon your discretion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! be satisfied!&rdquo; said the sewing-girl, both affected and
      amazed by the sorrowful expression of Florine&rsquo;s countenance; &ldquo;I
      will not be ungrateful. No one in the world but Agricola shall know that I
      have seen you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried Florine, with
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you thank me?&rdquo; said the other, astonished to see the large
      tears roll down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I am indebted to you for a moment of pure, unmixed happiness;
      for I have perhaps rendered a service to my dear mistress, without risking
      the increase of the troubles that already overwhelm me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not happy, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That astonishes you; but, believe me, whatever may be, your fate, I
      would gladly change with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said the sempstress: &ldquo;you appear
      to have too good a heart, for me to let you entertain such a wish&mdash;particularly
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope sincerely, mademoiselle,&rdquo; proceeded Mother Bunch, with
      deep sadness, &ldquo;that you may never know what it is to want work, when
      labor is your only resource.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you reduced to that extremity?&rdquo; cried Florine, looking
      anxiously at the young sempstress, who hung her head, and made no answer.
      She reproached herself, in her excessive delicacy, with having made a
      communication which resembled a complaint, though it had only been wrung
      from her by the thought of her dreadful situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is so,&rdquo; went on Florine, &ldquo;I pity you with all my
      heart; and yet I know not, if my misfortunes are not still greater than
      yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Florine exclaimed, suddenly:
      &ldquo;But let me see! If you are really in that position, I think I can
      procure you some work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, mademoiselle?&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch. &ldquo;I
      should never have dared to ask you such a service; but your generous offer
      commands my confidence, and may save me from destruction. I will confess
      to you, that, only this morning, I was thrown out of an employment which
      enabled me to earn four francs a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four francs a week!&rdquo; exclaimed Florine, hardly able to
      believe what she heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was little, doubtless,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but
      enough for me. Unfortunately, the person who employed me, has found out
      where it can be done still cheaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four francs a week!&rdquo; repeated Florine, deeply touched by so
      much misery and resignation. &ldquo;Well! I think I can introduce you to
      persons, who will secure you wages of at least two francs a day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could earn two francs a day? Is it possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is no doubt of it; only, you will have to go out by the
      day, unless you chose to take a pace as servant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my position,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, with a mixture of
      timidity and pride, &ldquo;one has no right, I know, to be overnice; yet I
      should prefer to go out by the day, and still more to remain at home, if
      possible, even though I were to gain less.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go out is unfortunately an indispensable condition,&rdquo; said
      Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must renounce this hope,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch,
      timidly; &ldquo;not that I refuse to go out to work&mdash;but those who do
      so, are expected to be decently clad&mdash;and I confess without shame,
      because there is no disgrace in honest poverty, that I have no better
      clothes than these.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be all,&rdquo; said Florine, hastily, &ldquo;they will find
      you the means of dressing yourself properly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch looked at Florine with increasing surprise. These offers were
      so much above what she could have hoped, and what indeed was generally
      earned by needlewomen, that she could hardly credit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed she, with hesitation, &ldquo;why should any one
      be so generous to me, mademoiselle? How should I deserve such high wages?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine started. A natural impulse of the heart, a desire to be useful to
      the sempstress, whose mildness and resignation greatly interested her, had
      led her to make a hasty proposition; she knew at what price would have to
      be purchased the advantages she proposed, and she now asked herself, if
      the hunchback would ever accept them on such terms. But Florine had gone
      too far to recede, and she durst not tell all. She resolved, therefore, to
      leave the future to chance and as those, who have themselves fallen, are
      little disposed to believe in the infallibility of others, Florine said to
      herself, that perhaps in the desperate position in which she was, Mother
      Bunch would not be so scrupulous after all. Therefore she said: &ldquo;I
      see, mademoiselle, that you are astonished at offers so much above what
      you usually gain; but I must tell you, that I am now speaking of a pious
      institution, founded to procure work for deserving young women. This
      establishment, which is called St. Mary&rsquo;s Society, undertakes to
      place them out as servants, or by the day as needlewomen. Now this
      institution is managed by such charitable persons, that they themselves
      undertake to supply an outfit, when the young women, received under their
      protection are not sufficiently well clothed to accept the places destined
      for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This plausible explanation of Florine&rsquo;s magnificent offers appeared
      to satisfy the hearer. &ldquo;I can now understand the high wages of which
      you speak, mademoiselle,&rdquo; resumed she; &ldquo;only I have no claim
      to be patronized by the charitable persons who direct this establishment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suffer&mdash;you are laborious and honest&mdash;those are
      sufficient claims; only, I must tell you, they will ask if you perform
      regularly your religious duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one loves and blesses God more fervently than I do,
      mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the hunchback, with mild firmness; &ldquo;but
      certain duties are an affair of conscience, and I would rather renounce
      this patronage, than be compelled&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world. Only, as I told you, there are very
      pious persons at the head of this institution, and you must not be
      astonished at their questions on such a subject. Make the trial, at all
      events; what do you risk? If the propositions are suitable&mdash;accept
      them; if, on the contrary, they should appear to touch your liberty of
      conscience, you can always refuse&mdash;your position will not be the
      worse for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch had nothing to object to this reasoning which left her at
      perfect freedom, and disarmed her of all suspicion. &ldquo;On these terms,
      mademoiselle,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I accept your offer, and thank you
      with all my heart. But who will introduce me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;to-morrow, if you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will perhaps desire to make some inquiries about me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The venerable Mother Sainte-Perpetue, Superior of St, Mary&rsquo;s
      Convent, where the institution is established, will, I am sure, appreciate
      your good qualities without inquiry; but if otherwise, she will tell you,
      and you can easily satisfy her. It is then agreed&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call upon you here, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; as I told you before, they must not know that you came here on
      the part of M. Agricola, and a second visit might be discovered, and
      excite suspicion. I will come and fetch you in a coach; where do you live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At No. 3, Rue Brise-Miche; as you are pleased to give yourself so
      much trouble, mademoiselle, you have only to ask the dyer, who acts as
      porter, to call down Mother Bunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch?&rdquo; said Florine, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; answered the sempstress, with a sad
      smile; &ldquo;it is the name every one gives me. And you see,&rdquo; added
      the hunchback, unable to restrain a tear, &ldquo;it is because of my
      ridiculous infirmity, to which this name alludes, that I dread going out
      to work among strangers, because there are so many people who laugh at
      one, without knowing the pain they occasion. But,&rdquo; continued she,
      drying her eyes, &ldquo;I have no choice, and must make up my mind to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine, deeply affected, took the speaker&rsquo;s hand, and said to her:
      &ldquo;Do not fear. Misfortunes like yours must inspire compassion, not
      ridicule. May I not inquire for you by your real name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Magdalen Soliveau; but I repeat, mademoiselle, that you had
      better ask for Mother Bunch, as I am hardly known by any other name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, then, be in the Rue Brise-Miche to-morrow, at twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mademoiselle! How can I ever requite your goodness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it: I only hope my interference may be of use
      to you. But of this you must judge for yourself. As for M. Agricola, do
      not answer his letter; wait till he is out of prison, and then tell him to
      keep his secret till he can see my poor mistress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the dear young lady now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you. I do not know where they took her, when she was
      attacked with this frenzy. You will expect me to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to-morrow,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convent whither Florine was to conduct the hunchback contained the
      daughters of Marshal Simon, and was next door to the lunatic asylum of Dr.
      Baleinier, in which Adrienne de Cardoville was confined.

      CHAPTER VI. MOTHER SAINTE-PERPETUE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>t. Mary&rsquo;s
      Convent, whither the daughters of Marshal Simon had been conveyed, was a
      large old building, the vast garden of which was on the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hopital,
      one of the most retired places in Paris, particularly at this period. The
      following scenes took place on the 12th February, the eve of the fatal
      day, on which the members of the family of Rennepont, the last descendants
      of the sister of the Wandering Jew, were to meet together in the Rue St.
      Francois. St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent was a model of perfect regularity. A
      superior council, composed of influential ecclesiastics, with Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      for president, and of women of great reputed piety, at the head of whom
      was the Princess de Saint Dizier, frequently assembled in deliberation, to
      consult on the means of extending and strengthening the secret and
      powerful influence of this establishment, which had already made
      remarkable progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skillful combinations and deep foresight had presided at the foundation of
      St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, which, in consequence of numerous donations,
      possessed already real estate to a great extent, and was daily augmenting
      its acquisitions. The religious community was only a pretext; but, thanks
      to an extensive connection, kept up by means of the most decided members
      of the ultramontane (i. e. high-church) party, a great number of rich
      orphans were placed in the convent, there to receive a solid, austere,
      religious education, very preferable, it was said, to the frivolous
      instruction which might be had in the fashionable boarding schools,
      infected by the corruption of the age. To widows also, and lone women who
      happened moreover to be rich, the convent offered a sure asylum from the
      dangers and temptations of the world; in this peaceful retreat, they
      enjoyed a delightful calm, and secured their salvation, whilst surrounded
      by the most tender and affectionate attentions. Nor was this all. Mother
      Sainte-Perpetue, the superior of the convent, undertook in the name of the
      institution to procure for the faithful, who wished to preserve the
      interior of their houses from the depravity of the age, companions for
      aged ladies, domestic servants, or needlewomen working by the day, all
      selected persons whose morality could be warranted. Nothing would seem
      more worthy of sympathy and encouragement than such an institution; but we
      shall presently unveil the vast and dangerous network of intrigue
      concealed under these charitable and holy appearances. The lady Superior,
      Mother Sainte-Perpetue, was a tall woman of about forty years of age, clad
      in a stuff dress of the Carmelite tan color, and wearing a long rosary at
      her waist; a white cap tied under the chin, and a long black veil, closely
      encircled her thin, sallow face. A number of deep wrinkles had impressed
      their transverse furrows in her forehead of yellow ivory; her marked and
      prominent nose was bent like the beak of a bird of prey; her black eye was
      knowing and piercing; the expression of her countenance was at once
      intelligent, cold and firm.
    </p>

      <a href="images/20069.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      In the general management of the pecuniary affairs of the community,
      Mother Sainte-Perpetue would have been a match for the most cunning
      attorney. When women are possessed of what is called a talent for
      business, and apply to it their keen penetration, their indefatigable
      perseverance, their prudent dissimulation, and, above all, that quick and
      exact insight, which is natural to them, the results are often prodigious.
      To Mother Sainte-Perpetue, a woman of the coolest and strongest intellect,
      the management of the vast transactions of the community was mere child&rsquo;s
      play. No one knew better how to purchase a depreciated property, to
      restore it to its former value, and then sell it with advantage; the price
      of stock, the rate of exchange, the current value of the shares in the
      different companies, were all familiar to her; she had yet never been
      known to make bad speculation, when the question was to invest any of the
      funds which were given by pious souls for the purposes of the convent. She
      had established in the house the utmost order and discipline, and, above
      all, an extreme economy. The constant aim of all her efforts was to
      enrich, not herself, but the community she directed; for the spirit of
      association, when become a collective egotism, gives to corporations the
      faults and vices of an individual. Thus a congregation may dote upon power
      and money, just as a miser loves them for their own sake. But it is
      chiefly with regard to estates that congregations act like a single man.
      They dream of landed property; it is their fixed idea, their fruitful
      monomania. They pursue it with their most sincere, and warm, and tender
      wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first estate is to a rising little community what the wedding
      trousseau is to a young bride, his first horse to a youth, his first
      success to a poet, to a gay girl her first fifty-guinea shawl; because,
      after all, in this material age, an estate gives a certain rank to a
      society on the Religious Exchange, and has so much the more effect upon
      the simple-minded, that all these partnerships in the work of salvation,
      which end by becoming immensely rich, begin with modest poverty as social
      stock-in-trade, and charity towards their neighbors as security reserve
      fund. We may therefore imagine what bitter and ardent rivalry must exist
      between the different congregations with regard to the various estates
      that each can lay claim to; with what ineffable satisfaction the richer
      society crushes the poorer beneath its inventory of houses, and farms and
      paper securities! Envy and hateful jealousy, rendered still more irritable
      by the leisure of a cloistered life, are the necessary consequences of
      such a comparison; and yet nothing is less Christian&mdash;in the adorable
      acceptation of that divine word&mdash;nothing has less in common with the
      true, essential, and religiously social spirit of the gospel, than this
      insatiable ardor to acquire wealth by every possible means&mdash;this
      dangerous avidity, which is far from being atoned for, in the eyes of
      public opinion, by a few paltry alms, bestowed in the narrow spirit of
      exclusion and intolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Sainte-Perpetue was seated before a large cylindrical-fronted desk
      in the centre of an apartment simply but comfortably furnished. An
      excellent fire burned within the marble chimney, and a soft carpet covered
      the floor. The superior, to whom all letters addressed to the sisters or
      the boarders were every day delivered, had just been opening she first,
      according to her acknowledged right, and carefully unsealing the second,
      without their knowing it, according to a right that she ascribed to
      herself, of course, with a view to the salvation of those dear creatures;
      and partly, perhaps, a little to make herself acquainted with their
      correspondence, for she also had imposed on herself the duty of reading
      all letters that were sent from the convent, before they were put into the
      post. The traces of this pious and innocent inquisition were easily
      effaced, for the good mother possessed a whole arsenal of steel tools,
      some very sharp, to cut the pager imperceptibly round the seal&mdash;others,
      pretty little rods, to be slightly heated and rolled round the edge of the
      seal, when the letter had been read and replaced in its envelope, so that
      the wax, spreading as it melted, might cover the first incision. Moreover,
      from a praiseworthy feeling of justice and equality, there was in the
      arsenal of the good mother a little fumigator of the most ingenious
      construction, the damp and dissolving vapor of which was reserved for the
      letters humbly and modestly secured with wafers, thus softened, they
      yielded to the least efforts, without any tearing of the paper. According
      to the importance of the revelations, which she thus gleaned from the
      writers of the letters, the superior took notes more or less extensive.
      She was interrupted in this investigation by two gentle taps at the bolted
      door. Mother Sainte-Perpetue immediately let down the sliding cylinder of
      her cabinet, so as to cover the secret arsenal, and went to open the door
      with a grave and solemn air. A lay sister came to announce to her that the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier was waiting for her in the parlor, and that
      Mdlle. Florine, accompanied by a young girl, deformed and badly dressed,
      was waiting at the door of the little corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduce the princess first,&rdquo; said Mother Sainte Perpetue.
      And, with charming forethought, she drew an armchair to the fire. Mme. de
      Saint Dizier entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without pretensions to juvenile coquetry, still the princess was
      tastefully and elegantly dressed. She wore a black velvet bonnet of the
      most fashionable make, a large blue cashmere shawl, and a black satin
      dress, trimmed with sable, to match the fur of her muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what good fortune am I again to-day indebted for the honor of
      your visit, my dear daughter?&rdquo; said the superior, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very important recommendation, my dear mother, though I am in a
      great hurry. I am expected at the house of his Eminence, and have,
      unfortunately, only a few minutes to spare. I have again to speak of the
      two orphans who occupied our attention so long yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They continue to be kept separate, according to your wish; and this
      separation has had such an effect upon them that I have been obliged to
      send this morning for Dr. Baleinier, from his asylum. He found much fever
      joined to great depression, and, singular enough, absolutely the same
      symptoms in both cases. I have again questioned these unfortunate
      creatures, and have been quite confounded and terrified to find them
      perfect heathens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, you see, very urgent to place them in your care. But to the
      subject of my visit, my dear mother: we have just learned the unexpected
      return of the soldier who brought these girls to France, and was thought
      to be absent for some days; but he is in Paris, and, notwithstanding his
      age, a man of extraordinary boldness, enterprise and energy. Should he
      discover that the girls are here (which, however, is fortunately almost
      impossible), in his rage at seeing them removed from his impious
      influence, he would be capable of anything. Therefore let me entreat you,
      my dear mother, to redouble your precautions, that no one may effect an
      entrance by night. This quarter of the town is so deserted!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, my dear daughter; we are sufficiently guarded. Our
      porter and gardeners, all well armed, make a round every night on the side
      of the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hopital. The walls are high, and furnished
      with spikes at the more accessible places. But I thank you, my dear
      daughter, for having warned me. We will redouble our precautions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly this night, my dear mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if this infernal soldier has the audacity to attempt such a
      thing, it will be this very night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know, my dear daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have information which makes us certain of it,&rdquo; replied
      the princess, with a slight embarrassment, which did not escape the notice
      of the Superior, though she was too crafty and reserved to appear to see
      it; only she suspected that many things were concealed from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This night, then,&rdquo; resumed Mother Sainte-Perpetue, &ldquo;we
      will be more than ever on our guard. But as I have the pleasure of seeing
      you, my dear daughter, I will take the opportunity to say a word or two on
      the subject of that marriage we mentioned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear mother,&rdquo; said the princess, hastily, &ldquo;for
      it is very important. The young Baron de Brisville is a man full of ardent
      devotion in these times of revolutionary impiety; he practises openly, and
      is able to render us great services. He is listened to in the Chamber, and
      does not want for a sort of aggressive and provoking eloquence; I know not
      any one whose tone is more insolent with regard to his faith, and the plan
      is a good one, for this cavalier and open manner of speaking of sacred
      things raises and excites the curiosity of the indifferent. Circumstances
      are happily such that he may show the most audacious violence towards our
      enemies, without the least danger to himself, which, of course, redoubles
      his ardor as a would-be martyr. In a word, he is altogether ours, and we,
      in return, must bring about this marriage. You know, besides, my dear
      mother, that he proposes to offer a donation of a hundred thousand francs
      to St. Mary&rsquo;s the day he gains possession of the fortune of Mdlle.
      Baudricourt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never doubted the excellent intentions of M. de Brisville
      with regard to an institution which merits the sympathy of all pious
      persons,&rdquo; answered the superior, discreetly; &ldquo;but I did not
      expect to meet with so many obstacles on the part of the young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This girl, whom I always believed a most simple, submissive, timid,
      almost idiotic person&mdash;instead of being delighted with this proposal
      of marriage, asks time to consider!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really pitiable!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She opposes to me an inert resistance. It is in vain for me to
      speak severely, and tell her that, having no parents or friends, and being
      absolutely confided to my care, she ought to see with my eyes, hear with
      my ears, and when I affirm that this union is suitable in all respects,
      give her adhesion to it without delay or reflection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. It would be impossible to speak more sensibly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She answers that she wishes to see M. de Brisville, and know his
      character before being engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absurd&mdash;since you undertake to answer for his morality,
      and esteem this a proper marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, I remarked to Mdlle. Baudricourt, this morning, that
      till now I had only employed gentle persuasion, but that, if she forced me
      to it, I should be obliged, in her own interest, to act with rigor, to
      conquer so much obstinacy that I should have to separate her from her
      companions, and to confine her closely in a cell, until she made up her
      mind, after all, to consult her own happiness, and&mdash;marry an
      honorable man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these menaces, my dear mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will, I hope, have a good effect. She kept up a correspondence with
      an old school-friend in the country. I have put a stop to this, for it
      appeared to me dangerous. She is now under my sole influence, and I hope
      we shall attain our ends; but you see, my dear daughter, it is never
      without crosses and difficulties that we succeed in doing good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I feel certain that M. de Brisville will even go beyond his
      first promise, and I will pledge myself for him, that, should he marry
      Mdlle. Baudricourt&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, my dear daughter,&rdquo; said the superior, interrupting
      the princess, &ldquo;that if I were myself concerned, I would refuse
      everything; but to give to this institution is to give to Heaven, and I
      cannot prevent M. de Brisville from augmenting the amount of his good
      works. Then, you see, we are exposed to a sad disappointment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, my dear mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sacred Heart Convent disputes an estate with us that would have
      suited us exactly. Really, some people are quite insatiable! I gave the
      lady superior my opinion upon it pretty freely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me as much,&rdquo; answered Madame de Saint-Dizier,
      &ldquo;and laid the blame on the steward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! so you see her, my dear daughter?&rdquo; exclaimed the
      superior, with an air of great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met her at the bishop&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Madame de
      Saint-Dizier, with a slight degree of hesitation, that Mother
      Sainte-Perpetue did not appear to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really do not know,&rdquo; resumed the latter, &ldquo;why our
      establishment should excite so violently the jealousy of the Sacred Heart.
      There is not an evil report that they have not spread with regard to St.
      Mary&rsquo;s Convent. Certain persons are always offended by the success
      of their neighbors!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear mother,&rdquo; said the princess, in a conciliating
      tone, &ldquo;we must hope that the donation of M. de Brisville will enable
      you to outbid the Sacred Heart. This marriage will have a double
      advantage, you see, my dear mother; it will place a large fortune at the
      disposal of a man who is devoted to us, and who will employ it as we wish;
      and it will also greatly increase the importance of his position as our
      defender, by the addition to his income of 100,000 francs a year. We shall
      have at length an organ worthy of our cause, and shall no longer be
      obliged to look for defenders amongst such people as that Dumoulin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is great power and much learning in the writings of the man
      you name. It is the style of a Saint Bernard, in wrath at the impiety of
      the age.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear mother! if you only knew what a strange Saint Bernard
      this Dumoulin is! But I will not offend your ears; all I can tell you is,
      that such defenders would compromise the most sacred cause. Adieu, my dear
      mother! pray redouble your precautions to-night&mdash;the return of this
      soldier is alarming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite satisfied, my dear daughter! Oh! I forgot. Mdlle. Florine
      begged me to ask you a favor. It is to let her enter your service. You
      know the fidelity she displayed in watching your unfortunate niece; I
      think that, by rewarding her in this way, you will attach her to you
      completely, and I shall feel grateful on her account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you interest yourself the least in the world in Florine, my dear
      mother, the thing is done. I will take her into my service. And now it
      strikes me, she may be more useful to me than I thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, my dear daughter, for such obliging attention to
      my request. I hope we shall soon meet again. The day after to-morrow, at
      two o&rsquo;clock, we have a long conference with his Eminence and the
      Bishop; do not forget!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear mother; I shall take care to be exact. Only, pray,
      redouble your precautions to-night for fear of a great scandal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After respectfully kissing the hand of the superior, the princess went out
      by the great door, which led to an apartment opening on the principal
      staircase. Some minutes after, Florine entered the room by another way.
      The superior was seated and Florine approached her with timid humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you meet the Princess de Saint-Dizier?&rdquo; asked Mother
      Sainte Perpetue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother; I was waiting in the passage, where the windows look
      out on the garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The princess takes you into her service from to-day,&rdquo; said
      the superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine made a movement of sorrowful surprise, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Me,
      mother! but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked her in your name, and you have only to accept,&rdquo;
      answered the other imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mother, I had entreated you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, that you accept the offer,&rdquo; said the superior, in
      so firm and positive a tone that Florine cast down her eyes, and replied
      in a low voice: &ldquo;I accept.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in M. Rodin&rsquo;s name that I give you this order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so, mother,&rdquo; replied Florine, sadly; &ldquo;on what
      conditions am I to serve the princess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the same conditions as those on which you served her niece.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine shuddered and said: &ldquo;I am, then, to make frequent secret
      reports with regard to the princess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will observe, you will remember, and you will give an account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will above all direct your attention to the visits that the
      princess may receive from the lady superior of the Sacred Heart. You must
      try and listen&mdash;for we have to preserve the princess from evil
      influences.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will obey, my mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will also try and discover why two young orphans have been
      brought hither, and recommended to be severely treated, by Madame Grivois,
      the confidential waiting-woman of the princess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which must not prevent you from remembering anything else that may
      be worthy of remark. To-morrow I will give you particular instructions
      upon another subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you conduct yourself in a satisfactory manner, and execute
      faithfully the instructions of which I speak, you will soon leave the
      princess to enter the service of a young bride; it will be an excellent
      and lasting situation always on the same conditions. It is, therefore,
      perfectly understood that you have asked me to recommend you to Madame de
      Saint Dizier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother; I shall remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this deformed young girl that accompanies you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor creature without any resources, very intelligent, and with
      an education above her class; she works at her needle, but is at present
      without employment, and reduced to the last extremity. I have made
      inquiries about her this morning; she has an excellent character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is ugly and deformed, you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has an interesting countenance, but she is deformed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The superior appeared pleased at this information, and added, after a
      moment&rsquo;s reflection: &ldquo;She appears intelligent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very intelligent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is absolutely without resources?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, without any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she pious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not practice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said the superior to herself; &ldquo;if she be
      intelligent, that will suffice.&rdquo; Then she resumed aloud. &ldquo;Do
      you know if she is a good workwoman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The superior rose, took a register from a shelf, appeared to be looking
      into it attentively for some time, and then said, as she replaced it:
      &ldquo;Fetch in this young girl, and go and wait for me in the press-room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deformed&mdash;intelligent&mdash;clever at her needle,&rdquo; said
      the superior, reflecting; &ldquo;she will excite no suspicion. We must
      see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In about a minute, Florine returned with Mother Bunch, whom she introduced
      to the superior, and then discreetly withdrew. The young sempstress was
      agitated, trembling, and much troubled, for she could, as it were, hardly
      believe a discovery which she had chanced to make during Florine&rsquo;s
      absence. It was not without a vague sense of terror that the hunchback
      remained alone with the lady superior.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE TEMPTATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his was the cause
      of Mother Bunch&rsquo;s emotion. Florine, when she went to see the
      superior, had left the young sempstress in a passage supplied with
      benches, and forming a sort of ante-chamber on the first story. Being
      alone, the girl had mechanically approached a window which looked upon the
      convent garden, shut in by a half demolished wall, and terminating at one
      end in an open paling. This wall was connected with a chapel that was
      still building, and bordered on the garden of a neighboring house. The
      sewing-girl, at one of the windows on the ground floor of this house&mdash;a
      grated window, still more remarkable by the sort of tent-like awning above
      it&mdash;beheld a young female, with her eyes fixed upon the convent,
      making signs with her hand, at once encouraging and affectionate. From the
      window where she stood, Mother Bunch could not see to whom these signs
      were addressed; but she admired the rare beauty of the telegrapher, the
      brilliancy of her complexion, the shining blackness of her large eyes, the
      sweet and benevolent smile which lingered on her lips. There was, no
      doubt, some answer to her graceful and expressive pantomime, for, by a
      movement full of elegance, the girl laid her left hand on her bosom, and
      waved her right, which seemed to indicate that her heart flew towards the
      place on which she kept her eyes. One faint sunbeam, piercing the clouds,
      came at this moment to play with the tresses of the pale countenance,
      which, now held close to the bars of the window, was suddenly, as it were,
      illuminated by the dazzling reflection of her splendid golden hair. At
      sight of that charming face, set in its admirable frame of red curls,
      Mother Bunch started involuntarily; the thought of Mdlle. de Cardoville
      crossed her mind, and she felt persuaded (nor was she, indeed, mistaken),
      that the protectress of Agricola was before her. On thus beholding, in
      that gloomy asylum, this young lady, so marvellously beautiful, and
      remembering the delicate kindness with which a few days before she had
      received Agricola in her luxurious little palace of dazzling splendor, the
      work-girl felt her heart sink within her. She believed Adrienne insane;
      and yet, as she looked attentively at her, it seemed as if intelligence
      and grace animated that adorable countenance. Suddenly, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville laid her fingers upon her lips, blew a couple of kisses in the
      direction towards which she had been looking, and all at once disappeared.
      Reflecting upon the important revelations which Agricola had to make to
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, Mother Bunch regretted bitterly that she had no
      means of approaching her; for she felt sure that, if the young lady were
      mad, the present was a lucid interval. She was yet absorbed in these
      uneasy reflections, when she saw Florine return, accompanied by one of the
      nuns. Mother Bunch was obliged, therefore, to keep silence with regard to
      the discovery she had made, and soon after she found herself in the
      superior&rsquo;s presence. This latter, after a rapid and searching
      examination of the countenance of the young workwoman, judged her
      appearance so timid, gentle and honest, that she thought she might repose
      full confidence in the information given by Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear daughter,&rdquo; said Mother Sainte-Perpetue, in an
      affectionate voice, &ldquo;Florine has told me in what a cruel situation
      you are placed. Is it true that you are entirely without work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me mother, my dear daughter; that name is dearer to me, and it
      is the rule of our house. I need not ask you what are your principles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always lived honestly by my labor, mother,&rdquo; answered
      the girl, with a simplicity at once dignified and modest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, my dear daughter, and I have good reasons for so
      doing. We must thank the Lord, who has delivered you from temptation; but
      tell me&mdash;are you clever at your trade?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do my best, mother, and have always satisfied my employers. If
      you please to try me, you will be able to judge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affirmation is sufficient, my dear daughter. You prefer, I
      think, to go out by the day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mdlle. Florine told me, mother, that I could not have work at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;not for the present, my child. If hereafter an
      opportunity should offer, I will think of it. Just now I have this to
      propose to you. A very respectable old lady has asked me to recommend to
      her a needle-woman by the day; introduced by me, you will certainly suit
      her. The institution will undertake to clothe you becomingly, and this
      advance we shall retain by degrees out of your wages, for you will look to
      us for payment. We propose to give you two francs a day; does that appear
      to you sufficient?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother! it is much more than I could have expected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, moreover, only be occupied from nine o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning till six in the evening; you will thus have still some off hours,
      of which you might make use. You see, the situation is not a hard one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! quite the contrary, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, first of all, with whom the institution intends to
      place you. It is a widow lady, named Mme. de Bremant, a person of the most
      steadfast piety. In her house, I hope, you will meet with none but
      excellent examples. If it should be otherwise, you can come and inform me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, mother?&rdquo; said the sewing-girl, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my dear daughter,&rdquo; said Mother Sainte-Perpetue,
      in a tone ever more and more affectionate; &ldquo;the institution of St.
      Mary has a double end in view. You will perfectly understand that, if it
      is our duty to give to masters and mistresses every possible security as
      to the morality of the persons that we place in their families, we are
      likewise bound to give to the persons that we so place out every possible
      security as to the morality of their employers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be more just and of a wiser foresight, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, my dear daughter; for even as a servant of bad morals
      may cause the utmost trouble in a respectable family, so the bad conduct
      of a master or mistress may have the most baneful influence on the persons
      who serve them, or who come to work in their houses. Now, it is to offer a
      mutual guarantee to good masters and honest servants, that we have founded
      this institution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, with simplicity; &ldquo;such
      designs merit the thanks and blessings of every one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And blessings do not fail us, my dear daughter, because we perform
      our promises. Thus, an interesting workwoman&mdash;such as you, for
      example&mdash;is placed with persons that we suppose irreproachable.
      Should she, however, perceive, on the part of her employers, or on that of
      the persons who frequent the house, any irregularity of morals, any
      tendency to what would offend her modesty, or shock her religious
      principles, she should immediately give us a detailed account of the
      circumstances that have caused her alarm. Nothing can be more proper&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch, timidly, for she began
      to find this provision somewhat singular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; resumed the superior, &ldquo;if the case appears a
      serious one, we exhort our befriended one to observe what passes more
      attentively, so as to convince herself whether she had really reason to be
      alarmed. She makes a new report to us, and should it confirm our first
      fears, faithful to our pious guardianship, we withdraw her instantly from
      the house. Moreover, as the majority of our young people, notwithstanding
      their innocence and virtue, have not always sufficient experience to
      distinguish what may be injurious to their soul&rsquo;s health, we think
      it greatly to their interest that they should confide to us once a week,
      as a child would to her mother, either in person or by letter, whatever
      has chanced to occur in the house in which we have placed them. Then we
      can judge for them, whether to withdraw them or not. We have already about
      a hundred persons, companions to ladies, young women in shops, servants,
      and needlewomen by the day, whom we have placed in a great number of
      families, and, for the interest of all, we have every reason to
      congratulate ourselves on this mode of proceeding. You understand me, do
      you not, my dear daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes-yes, mother,&rdquo; said the sempstress, more and more
      embarrassed. She had too much uprightness and sagacity not to perceive
      that this plan of mutually insuring the morality of masters and servants
      resembled a vast spy system, brought home to the domestic hearth, and
      carried on by the members of the institution almost without their
      knowledge, for it would have been difficult to disguise more skillfully
      the employment for which they were trained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have entered into these long details my dear daughter,&rdquo;
      resumed Mother Sainte-Perpetue, taking the hearer&rsquo;s silence for
      consent, &ldquo;it is that you may not suppose yourself obliged to remain
      in the house in question, if, against our expectation, you should not find
      there holy and pious examples. I believe Mme. de Bremont&rsquo;s house to
      be a pure and godly place; only I have heard (though I will not believe
      it) that Mme. de Bremont&rsquo;s daughter, Mme. de Noisy, who has lately
      come to reside with her, is not so exemplary in her conduct as could be
      desired, that she does not fulfil regularly her religious duties, and
      that, during the absence of her husband, who is now in America, she
      receives visits, unfortunately too frequent, from one M. Hardy, a rich
      manufacturer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Agricola&rsquo;s master, Mother Bunch could not suppress a
      movement of surprise, and also blushed slightly. The superior naturally
      mistook this surprise and confusion for a proof of the modest
      susceptibility of the young sempstress, and added: &ldquo;I have told you
      all this, my dear daughter, that you might be on your guard. I have even
      mentioned reports that I believe to be completely erroneous, for the
      daughter of Mme. de Bremont has always had such good examples before her
      that she cannot have so forgotten them. But, being in the house from
      morning to night, you will be able, better than any one, to discover if
      these reports have any foundation in truth. Should it unfortunately so
      turn out, my dear daughter, you would come and confide to me all the
      circumstances that have led you to such a conclusion; and, should I then
      agree in your opinion, I would withdraw you instantly from the house&mdash;for
      the piety of the mother would not compensate sufficiently for the
      deplorable example of the daughter&rsquo;s conduct. For, as soon as you
      form part of the institution, I am responsible for your salvation, and, in
      case your delicacy should oblige you to leave Mme. de Bremont&rsquo;s, as
      you might be some time without employment, the institution will allow you,
      if satisfied with your zeal and conduct, one franc a day till we could
      find you another place. You see, my dear daughter, that you have
      everything to gain with us. It is therefore agreed that the day after
      to-morrow you go to Mme. de Bremont&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Mother Bunch found
      herself in a very hard position. Sometimes she thought that her first
      suspicions were confirmed, and, notwithstanding her timidity, her pride
      felt hurt at the supposition, that, because they knew her poor, they
      should believe her capable of selling herself as a spy for the sake of
      high wages. Sometimes, on the contrary, her natural delicacy revolted at
      the idea that a woman of the age and condition of the superior could
      descend to make a proposition so disgraceful both to the accepter and the
      proposer, and she reproached herself with her first doubts and asked
      herself if the superior had not wished to try her, before employing her,
      to see if her probity would enable her to resist a comparatively brilliant
      offer. Mother Bunch was naturally so inclined to think well of every one,
      that she made up her mind to this last conclusion, saying to herself, that
      if, after all, she were deceived, it would be the least offensive mode of
      refusing these unworthy offers. With a movement, exempt from all
      haughtiness, but expressive of natural dignity, the young workman raised
      her head, which she had hitherto held humbly cast down, looked the
      superior full in the face, that the latter might read in her countenance
      the sincerity of her words, and said to her in a slightly agitated voice,
      forgetting this time to call her &ldquo;mother&rdquo;: &ldquo;Ah, madame!
      I cannot blame you for exposing me to such a trial. You see that I am very
      poor, and I have yet done nothing to command your confidence. But, believe
      me, poor as I am, I would never stoop to so despicable an action as that
      which you have thought fit to propose to me, no doubt to assure yourself,
      by my refusal, that I am worthy of your kindness. No, no, madame&mdash;I
      could never bring myself to be a spy at any price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20085.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      She pronounced these last words with so much animation that her cheeks
      became slightly flushed. The superior had too much tact and experience not
      to perceive the sincerity of the words. Thinking herself lucky that the
      young girl should put this construction upon the affair, she smiled upon
      her affectionately, and stretched out her arms to her, saying: &ldquo;It
      is well, my dear daughter. Come and embrace me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&mdash;I am really confused&mdash;with so much kindness&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;you deserve it&mdash;your words are so full of truth and
      honesty. Only be persuaded that I have not put you to any trial, because
      there is no resemblance between the act of a spy and the marks of filial
      confidence that we require of our members for the sake of watching over
      their morals. But certain persons&mdash;I see you are of the number, my
      dear daughter&mdash;have such fixed principles, and so mature a judgment,
      that they can do without our advice and guardianship, and can appreciate
      themselves whatever might be dangerous to their salvation. I will
      therefore leave the entire responsibility to yourself, and only ask you
      for such communications as you may think proper to make.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! how good you are!&rdquo; said poor Mother Bunch, for
      she was not aware of the thousand devices of the monastic spirit, and
      thought herself already sure of gaining just wages honorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not goodness&mdash;but justice!&rdquo; answered Mother
      Sainte-Perpetue, whose tone was becoming more and more affectionate.
      &ldquo;Too much tenderness cannot be shown to pious young women like you,
      whom poverty has only purified because they have always faithfully
      observed the divine laws.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last question, my child! how many times a month do you approach
      the Lord&rsquo;s table?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied the hunchback, &ldquo;I have not taken the
      sacrament since my first communion, eight years ago. I am hardly able, by
      working every day, and all day long, to earn my bread. I have no time&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; cried the superior, interrupting, and
      clasping her hands with all the signs of painful astonishment. &ldquo;Is
      it possible? you do not practise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, madame! I tell you that I have no time,&rdquo; answered
      Mother Bunch, looking disconcertedly at Mother Saint-Perpetue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved, my dear daughter,&rdquo; said the latter sorrowfully,
      after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;but I told you that, as we place
      our friends in none but pious houses, so we are asked to recommend none
      but pious persons, who practise their religious duties. It is one of the
      indispensable conditions of our institution. It will, therefore, to my
      great regret, be impossible for me to employ you as I had hoped. If,
      hereafter, you should renounce your present indifference to those duties,
      we will then see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, her heart swollen with tears, for
      she was thus forced to abandon a cheering hope, &ldquo;I beg pardon for
      having detained you so long&mdash;for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, my dear daughter, who regret not to be able to attach you
      to the institution; but I am not altogether hopeless, that a person,
      already so worthy of interest, will one day deserve by her piety the
      lasting support of religious people. Adieu, my dear daughter! go in peace,
      and may God be merciful to you, until the day that you return with your
      whole heart to Him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the superior rose, and conducted her visitor to the door, with
      all the forms of the most maternal kindness. At the moment she crossed the
      threshold, she said to her: &ldquo;Follow the passage, go down a few
      steps, and knock at the second door on the right hand. It is the
      press-room, and there you will find Florine. She will show you the way
      out. Adieu, my dear daughter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Mother Bunch had left the presence of the superior, her tears,
      until now restrained, gushed forth abundantly. Not wishing to appear
      before Florine and the nuns in this state, she stopped a moment at one of
      the windows to dry her eyes. As she looked mechanically towards the
      windows of the next house, where she fancied she had seen Adrienne de
      Cardoville, she beheld the latter come from a door in the building, and
      advance rapidly towards the open paling that separated the two gardens. At
      the same instant, and to her great astonishment, Mother Bunch saw one of
      the two sisters whose disappearance had caused the despair of Dagobert,
      with pale and dejected countenance, approach the fence that separated her
      from Mdlle. de Cardoville, trembling with fear and anxiety, as though she
      dreaded to be discovered.

      CHAPTER VIII. MOTHER BUNCH AND MDLLE. DE CARDOVILLE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>gitated,
      attentive, uneasy, leaning from one of the convent-windows, the work-girl
      followed with her eyes the movements of Mdlle. de Cardoville and Rose
      Simon, whom she so little expected to find together in such a place. The
      orphan, approaching close to the fence, which separated the nunnery-garden
      from that of Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s asylum, spoke a few words to Adrienne,
      whose features at once expressed astonishment, indignation, and pity. At
      this juncture, a nun came running, and looking right and left, as though
      anxiously seeking for some one; then, perceiving Rose, who timidly pressed
      close to the paling, she seized her by the arm, and seemed to scold her
      severely, and notwithstanding some energetic words addressed to her by
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, she hastily carried off the orphan, who with weeping
      eyes, turned several times to look back at Adrienne; whilst the latter,
      after showing the interest she took in her by expressive gestures, turned
      away suddenly, as if to conceal her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage in which the witness stood, during this touching scene, was
      situated on the first story. The thought immediately occurred to the
      sempstress, to go down to the ground-floor, and try to get into the
      garden, so that she might have an opportunity of speaking to the fair girl
      with the golden hair, and ascertaining if it were really Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, to whom; if she found her in a lucid interval, she might say
      that Agricola had things of the greatest importance to communicate, but
      that he did not know how to inform her of them. The day was advancing, the
      sun was on its decline, and fearing that Florine would be tired of waiting
      for her, Mother Bunch made haste to act; with a light step, listening
      anxiously as she went, she reached the end of the passage, where three or
      four stairs led down to the landing-place of the press room, and then
      formed a spiral descent to the ground-floor. Hearing voices in the
      pressroom, the sempstress hastened down the stairs, and found herself in a
      long passage, in the centre of which was a glass door, opening on that
      part of the garden reserved for the superior. A path, bordered by a high
      box-hedge, sheltered her from the gaze of curious eyes, and she crept
      along it, till she reached the open paling; which, at this spot, separated
      the convent-garden from that of Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s asylum. She saw
      Mdlle. de Cardoville a few steps from her, seated, and with her arm
      resting upon a rustic bench. The firmness of Adrienne&rsquo;s character
      had for a moment been shaken by fatigue, astonishment, fright, despair, on
      the terrible night when she had been taken to the asylum by Dr. Baleinier;
      and the latter, taking a diabolical advantage of her weakness and
      despondency, had succeeded for a moment in making her doubt of her own
      sanity. But the calm, which necessarily follows the most painful and
      violent emotions, combined with the reflection and reasoning of a clear
      and subtle intellect, soon convinced Adrienne of the groundlessness of the
      fears inspired by the crafty doctor. She no longer believed that it could
      even be a mistake on the part of the man of science. She saw clearly in
      the conduct of this man, in which detestable hypocrisy was united with
      rare audacity, and both served by a skill no less remarkable, that M.
      Baleinier was, in fact, the blind instrument of the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier. From that moment, she remained silent and calm, but full of
      dignity; not a complaint, not a reproach was allowed to pass her lips. She
      waited. Yet, though they left her at liberty to walk about (carefully
      depriving her of all means of communicating with any one beyond the
      walls), Adrienne&rsquo;s situation was harsh and painful, particularly for
      her, who so loved to be surrounded by pleasant and harmonious objects. She
      felt, however, that this situation could not last long. She did not
      thoroughly understand the penetration and action of the laws; but her good
      sense taught her, that a confinement of a few days under the plea of some
      appearances of insanity, more or less plausible in themselves, might be
      attempted, and even executed with impunity; but that it could not be
      prolonged beyond certain limits, because, after all, a young lady of her
      rank in society could not disappear suddenly from the world, without
      inquiries being made on the subject&mdash;and the pretence of a sudden
      attack of madness would lead to a serious investigation. Whether true or
      false, this conviction had restored Adrienne to her accustomed elasticity
      and energy of character. And yet she sometimes in vain asked herself the
      cause of this attempt on her liberty. She knew too well the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier, to believe her capable of acting in this way, without a
      certain end in view, and merely for the purpose of inflicting a momentary
      pang. In this, Mdlle. de Cardoville was not deceived: Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and the princess were both persuaded, that Adrienne, better informed than
      she wished to acknowledge, knew how important it was for her to find
      herself in the house in the Rue Saint-Francois on the 13th of February,
      and was determined to maintain her rights. In shutting up Adrienne as mad,
      it was intended to strike a fatal blow at her future prospects; but this
      last precaution was useless, for Adrienne, though upon the true scent of
      the family-secret they lead wished to conceal from her, had not yet
      entirely penetrated its meaning, for want of certain documents, which had
      been lost or hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever had been the motives for the odious conduct of Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&rsquo;s enemies, she was not the less disgusted at it. No one
      could be more free from hatred or revenge, than was this generous young
      girl, but when she thought of all the sufferings which the Princess de
      Saint Dizier, Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and Dr. Baleinier had occasioned her,
      she promised herself, not reprisals, but a striking reparation. If it were
      refused her, she was resolved to combat&mdash;without truce or rest&mdash;this
      combination of craft, hypocrisy, and cruelty, not from resentment for what
      she had endured, but to preserve from the same torments other innocent
      victims, who might not, like her, be able to struggle and defend
      themselves. Adrienne, still under the painful impression which had been
      caused by her interview with Rose Simon, was leaning against one of the
      sides of the rustic bench on which she was seated, and held her left hand
      over her eyes. She had laid down her bonnet beside her, and the inclined
      position of her head brought the long golden curls over her fair, shining
      cheeks. In this recumbent attitude, so full of careless grace, the
      charming proportions of her figure were seen to advantage beneath a
      watered green dress, while a broad collar, fastened with a rose-colored
      satin bow, and fine lace cuffs, prevented too strong a contrast between
      the hue of her dress and the dazzling whiteness of the swan-like neck and
      Raphaelesque hands, imperceptibly veined with tiny azure lines. Over the
      high and well-formed instep, were crossed the delicate strings of a
      little, black satin shoe&mdash;for Dr. Baleinier had allowed her to dress
      herself with her usual taste, and elegance of costume was not with
      Adrienne a mark of coquetry, but of duty towards herself, because she had
      been made so beautiful. At sight of this young lady, whose dress and
      appearance she admired in all simplicity, without any envious or bitter
      comparison with her own poor clothes and deformity of person, Mother Bunch
      said immediately to herself, with the good sense and sagacity peculiar to
      her, that it was strange a mad woman should dress so sanely and
      gracefully. It was therefore with a mixture of surprise and emotion that
      she approached the fence which separated her from Adrienne&mdash;reflecting,
      however, that the unfortunate girl might still be insane, and that this
      might turn out to be merely a lucid interval. And now, with a timid voice,
      but loud enough to be heard, Mother Bunch, in order to assure herself of
      Adrienne&rsquo;s identity, said, whilst her heart beat fast: &ldquo;Mdlle.
      de Cardoville!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who calls me?&rdquo; said Adrienne. On hastily raising her head,
      and perceiving the hunchback, she could not suppress a slight cry of
      surprise, almost fright. For indeed this poor creature, pale, deformed,
      miserably clad, thus appearing suddenly before her, must have inspired
      Mdlle, de Cardoville, so passionately fond of grace and beauty, with a
      feeling of repugnance, if not of terror&mdash;and these two sentiments
      were both visible in her expressive countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not perceive the impression she had made. Motionless, with
      her eyes fixed, and her hands clasped in a sort of adoring admiration, she
      gazed on the dazzling beauty of Adrienne, whom she had only half seen
      through the grated window. All that Agricola had told her of the charms of
      his protectress, appeared to her a thousand times below the reality; and
      never, even in her secret poetic visions, had she dreamed of such rare
      perfection. Thus, by a singular contrast, a feeling of mutual surprise
      came over these two girls&mdash;extreme types of deformity and beauty,
      wealth and wretchedness. After rendering, as it were, this involuntary
      homage to Adrienne, Mother Bunch advanced another step towards the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, rising with a
      sentiment of repugnance, which could not escape the work-girl&rsquo;s
      notice; accordingly, she held down her head timidly, and said in a soft
      voice: &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame, to appear so suddenly before you.
      But moments are precious, I come from Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she pronounced these words, the sempstress raised her eyes anxiously,
      fearing that Mdlle. de Cardoville might have forgotten the name of the
      workman. But, to her great surprise and joy, the fears of Adrienne seemed
      to diminish at the name of Agricola, and approaching the fence, she looked
      at the speaker with benevolent curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come from M. Agricola Baudoin?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Who are
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His adopted sister, madame&mdash;a poor needlewoman, who lives in
      the same house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne appeared to collect her thoughts, and said, smiling kindly, after
      a moment&rsquo;s silence: &ldquo;It was you then, who persuaded M.
      Agricola to apply to me to procure him bail?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame, do you remember&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget anything that is generous and noble. M. Agricola was
      much affected when he spoke of your devotion. I remember it well; it would
      be strange if I did not. But how came you here, in this convent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me that I should perhaps be able to get some occupation
      here, as I am out of work. Unfortunately, I have been refused by the lady
      superior.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you recognize me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your great beauty, madame, of which Agricola had told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather by this,&rdquo; said Adrienne, smiling as she lifted,
      with the tips of her rosy fingers, one end of a long, silky ringlet of
      golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must pardon Agricola, madame,&rdquo; said the sewing girl, with
      one of those half smiles, which rarely settled on her lips: &ldquo;he is a
      poet, and omitted no single perfection in the respectful and admiring
      description which he gave of his protectress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what induced you to come and speak to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hope of being useful to you, madame. You received Agricola with
      so much goodness, that I have ventured to go shares in his gratitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well venture to do so, my dear girl,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with ineffable grace; &ldquo;until now, unfortunately, I have only been
      able to serve your adopted brother by intention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they exchanged these words, Adrienne and Mother Bunch looked at each
      other with increasing surprise. The latter was, first of all, astonished
      that a person who passed for mad should express herself as Adrienne did;
      next, she was amazed at the ease and freedom with which she herself
      answered the questions of Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;not knowing that the
      latter was endowed with the precious privilege of lofty and benevolent
      natures, to draw out from those who approached her whatever sympathized
      with herself. On her side, Mdlle. de Cardoville was deeply moved and
      astonished to hear this young, low-born girl, dressed almost like a
      beggar, express herself in terms selected with so much propriety. The more
      she looked at her, the more the feeling of repugnance she at first
      experienced wore off, and was at length converted into quite the opposite
      sentiment. With that rapid and minute power of observation natural to
      women, she remarked beneath the black crape of Mother Bunch&rsquo;s cap,
      the smoothness and brilliancy of the fair, chestnut hair. She remarked,
      too, the whiteness of the long, thin hand, though it displayed itself at
      the end of a patched and tattered sleeve&mdash;an infallible proof that
      care, and cleanliness, and self-respect were at least struggling against
      symptoms of fearful distress. Adrienne discovered, also, in the pale and
      melancholy features, in the expression of the blue eyes, at once
      intelligent, mild and timid, a soft and modest dignity, which made one
      forget the deformed figure. Adrienne loved physical beauty, and admired it
      passionately, but she had too superior a mind, too noble a soul, too
      sensitive a heart, not to know how to appreciate moral beauty, even when
      it beamed from a humble and suffering countenance. Only, this kind of
      appreciation was new to Mdlle. de Cardoville; until now, her large fortune
      and elegant habits had kept her at a distance from persons of Mother Bunch&rsquo;s
      class. After a short silence, during which the fair patrician and the poor
      work-girl had closely examined each other, Adrienne said to the other:
      &ldquo;It is easy, I think, to explain the cause of our mutual
      astonishment. You have, no doubt, discovered that I speak pretty
      reasonably for a mad woman&mdash;if they have told you I am one. And I,&rdquo;
      added Mdlle. de Cardoville, in a tone of respectful commiseration, &ldquo;find
      that the delicacy of your language and manners so singularly contrast with
      the position in which you appear to be, that my surprise must be even
      greater than yours.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, with a welling forth of such
      deep and sincere joy that the tears started to her eyes; &ldquo;is it
      true?&mdash;they have deceived me&mdash;you are not mad! Just now, when I
      beheld you so kind and beautiful, when I heard the sweet tone of your
      voice, I could not believe that such a misfortune had happened to you.
      But, alas! how is it then, madame, that you are in this place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Adrienne, touched by the affectionate
      interest of this excellent creature; &ldquo;and how is it that you, with
      such a heart and head, should be in such distress? But be satisfied! I
      shall not always be here&mdash;and that will suffice to tell you, that we
      shall both resume the place which becomes us. Believe me, I shall never
      forget how, in spite of the painful ideas which must needs occupy your
      mind, on seeing yourself deprived of work&mdash;your only resource&mdash;you
      have still thought of coming to me, and of trying to serve me. You may,
      indeed, be eminently useful to me, and I am delighted at it, for then I
      shall owe you much&mdash;and you shall see how I will take advantage of my
      gratitude!&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a sweet smile. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
      resumed she, &ldquo;before talking of myself, let us think of others. Is
      your adopted brother still in prison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time, madame, I hope he has obtained his freedom; thanks to
      the generosity of one of his comrades. His father went yesterday to offer
      bail for him, and they promised that he should be released to-day. But,
      from his prison, he wrote to me, that he had something of importance to
      reveal to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame. Should Agricola be released immediately by what means
      can he communicate with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has secrets to tell me!&rdquo; resumed Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      with an air of thoughtful surprise. &ldquo;I seek in vain to imagine what
      they can be; but so long as I am confined in this house, and secluded from
      every one, M. Agricola must not think of addressing himself directly or
      indirectly to me. He must wait till I am at liberty; but that is not all,
      he must deliver from that convent two poor children, who are much more to
      be pitied than I am. The daughters of Marshal Simon are detained there
      against their will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know their name, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When M. Agricola informed me of their arrival in Paris, he told me
      they were fifteen years old, and that they resembled each other exactly&mdash;so
      that, the day before yesterday, when I took my accustomed walk, and
      observed two poor little weeping faces come close to the windows of their
      separate cells, one on the ground floor, the other on the first story, a
      secret presentiment told me that I saw in them the orphans of whom M.
      Agricola had spoken, and in whom I already took a lively interest, as
      being my relations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are your relations, madame, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly. So, not being able to do more, I tried to express
      by signs how much I felt for them. Their tears, and the sadness of their
      charming faces, sufficiently told me that they were prisoners in the
      convent, as I am myself in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I understand, madame&mdash;the victim of the animosity of your
      family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever may be my fate, I am much less to be pitied than these two
      children, whose despair is really alarming. Their separation is what
      chiefly oppresses them. By some words that one of them just now said to
      me, I see that they are, like me, the victims of an odious machination.
      But thanks to you, it will be possible to save them: Since I have been in
      this house I have had no communication with any one; they have not allowed
      me pen or paper, so it is impossible to write. Now listen to me
      attentively, and we shall be able to defeat an odious persecution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, speak! speak, madame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soldier, who brought these orphans to France, the father of M.
      Agricola, is still in town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame. Oh! if you only knew his fury, his despair, when, on
      his return home, he no longer found the children that a dying mother had
      confided to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must take care not to act with the least violence. It would ruin
      all. Take this ring,&rdquo; said Adrienne, drawing it from her finger,
      &ldquo;and give it to him. He must go instantly&mdash;are you sure that
      you can remember a name and address?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, madame. Be satisfied on that point. Agricola only
      mentioned your name once, and I have not forgotten it. There is a memory
      of the heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive it, my dear girl. Remember, then, the name of the Count
      de Montbron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count de Montbron&mdash;I shall not forget.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of my good old friends, and lives on the Place Vendome,
      No. 7.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place Vendome, No. 7&mdash;I shall remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Agricola&rsquo;s father must go to him this evening, and, if he
      is not at home, wait for his coming in. He must ask to speak to him, as if
      from me, and send him this ring as a proof of what he says. Once with him,
      he must tell him all&mdash;the abduction of the girls, the name of the
      convent where they are confined, and my own detention as a lunatic in the
      asylum of Dr. Baleinier. Truth has an accent of its own, which M. de
      Montbron will recognize. He is a man of much experience and judgment, and
      possessed of great influence. He will immediately take the necessary
      steps, and to-morrow, or the day after, these poor orphans and myself will
      be restored to liberty&mdash;all thanks to you! But moments are precious;
      we might be discovered; make haste, dear child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of drawing back, Adrienne said to Mother Bunch, with so
      sweet a smile and affectionate a tone, that it was impossible not to
      believe her sincere: &ldquo;M. Agricola told me that I had a heart like
      yours. I now understand how honorable, how flattering those words were for
      me. Pray, give me your hand!&rdquo; added Mdlle. de Cardoville, whose eyes
      were filling with tears; and, passing her beautiful hand through an
      opening in the fence, she offered it to the other. The words and the
      gesture of the fair patrician were full of so much real cordiality, that
      the sempstress, with no false shame, placed tremblingly her own poor thin
      hand in Adrienne&rsquo;s, while the latter, with a feeling of pious
      respect, lifted it spontaneously to her lips, and said: &ldquo;Since I
      cannot embrace you as my sister, let me at least kiss this hand, ennobled
      by labor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, footsteps were heard in the garden of Dr. Baleinier; Adrienne
      withdrew abruptly, and disappeared behind some trees, saying: &ldquo;Courage,
      memory, and hope!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had passed so rapidly that the young workwoman had no time to
      speak or move; tears, sweet tears, flowed abundantly down her pale cheeks.
      For a young lady, like Adrienne de Cardoville, to treat her as a sister,
      to kiss her hand, to tell her that she was proud to resemble her in heart&mdash;her,
      a poor creature, vegetating in the lowest abyss of misery&mdash;was to
      show a spirit of fraternal equality, divine, as the gospel words.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are words and impressions which make a noble soul forget years of
      suffering, and which, as by a sudden flash, reveal to it something of its
      own worth and grandeur. Thus it was with the hunchback. Thanks to this
      generous speech, she was for a moment conscious of her own value. And
      though this feeling was rapid as it was ineffable, she clasped her hands
      and raised her eyes to heaven with an expression of fervent gratitude;
      for, if the poor sempstress did not practise, to use the jargon of
      ultramontane cant, no one was more richly endowed with that deep religious
      sentiment, which is to mere dogmas what the immensity of the starry heaven
      is to the vaulted roof of a church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after quitting Mdlle. de Cardoville, Mother Bunch, having
      left the garden without being perceived, reascended to the first story,
      and knocked gently at the door of the press-room. A sister came to open
      the door to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not Mdlle. Florine, with whom I came, still here, sister?&rdquo;
      asked the needlewoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could not wait for you any longer. No doubt, you have come from
      our mother the superior?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, sister,&rdquo; answered the sempstress, casting down her
      eyes; &ldquo;would you have the goodness to show me the way out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sewing-girl followed the nun, trembling at every step lest she should
      meet the superior, who would naturally have inquired the cause of her long
      stay in the convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the inner gate closed upon Mother Bunch. Passing rapidly across
      the vast court-yard and approaching the porter&rsquo;s lodge, to ask him
      to let her out, she heard these words pronounced in a gruff voice: &ldquo;It
      seems, old Jerome, that we are to be doubly on our guard to-night. Well, I
      shall put two extra balls in my gun. The superior says we are to make two
      rounds instead of one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no gun, Nicholas,&rdquo; said the other voice; &ldquo;I have
      my sharp scythe, a true gardener&rsquo;s weapon&mdash;and none the worse
      for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling an involuntary uneasiness at these words, which she had heard by
      mere chance, Mother Bunch approached the porter&rsquo;s lodge, and asked
      him to open the outer gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; challenged the porter, leaning half
      way out of his lodge, with a double barrelled gun, which he was occupied
      in loading, in his hand, and at the same time examining the sempstress
      with a suspicious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from speaking to the superior,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; said Nicholas roughly. &ldquo;You look like a
      sanctified scarecrow. Never mind. Make haste and cut!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate opened, and Mother Bunch went out. Hardly had she gone a few
      steps in the sweet, when, to her great surprise, she saw the dog Spoil
      sport run up to her, and his master, Dagobert, a little way behind him,
      arriving also with precipitation. She was hastening to meet the soldier,
      when a full, sonorous voice exclaimed from a little distance: &ldquo;Oh my
      good sister!&rdquo; which caused the girl to turn round. From the opposite
      side to that whence Dagobert was coming, she saw Agricola hurrying towards
      the spot.

      CHAPTER IX. THE ENCOUNTERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the sight of
      Dagobert and Agricola, Mother Bunch remained motionless with surprise, a
      few steps from the convent-gate. The soldier had not yet perceived the
      sempstress. He advanced rapidly, following the dog, who though lean,
      half-starved, rough-coated, and dirty, seemed to frisk with pleasure, as
      he turned his intelligent face towards his master, to whom he had gone
      back, after caressing Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I understand you, old fellow!&rdquo; said the soldier,
      with emotion. &ldquo;You are more faithful than I was; you did not leave
      the dear children for a minute. Yes, you followed them, and watched day
      and night, without food, at the door of the house to which they were taken&mdash;and,
      at length, weary of waiting to see them come forth, ran home to fetch me.
      Yes; whilst I was giving way to despair, like a furious madman, you were
      doing what I ought to have done&mdash;discovering their retreat. What does
      it all prove? Why, that beasts are better than men&mdash;which is well
      known. Well, at length I shall see them again. When I think that tomorrow
      is the 13th, and that without you, my did Spoil-sport, all would be lost&mdash;it
      makes me shudder. But I say, shall we soon be there? What a deserted
      quarter! and night coming on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert had held this discourse to Spoil-sport, as he walked along
      following the good dog, who kept on at a rapid pace. Suddenly, seeing the
      faithful animal start aside with a bound, he raised his eyes, and
      perceived the dog frisking about the hunchback and Agricola, who had just
      met at a little distance from the convent-gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch?&rdquo; exclaimed both father and son, as they
      approached the young workwoman, and looked at her with extreme surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is good hope, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said she with inexpressible
      joy. &ldquo;Rose and Blanche are found!&rdquo; Then, turning towards the
      smith, she added, &ldquo;There is good hope, Agricola: Mdlle. de
      Cardoville is not mad. I have just seen her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not mad? what happiness!&rdquo; exclaimed the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, trembling with emotion, as he
      took the work-girl&rsquo;s hands in his own. &ldquo;You have seen them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; just now&mdash;very sad&mdash;very unhappy&mdash;but I was not
      able to speak to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Dagobert, stopping as if suffocated by the news,
      and pressing his hands on his bosom; &ldquo;I never thought that my old
      heart could beat so!&mdash;And yet, thanks to my dog, I almost expected
      what has taken place. Anyhow, I am quite dizzy with joy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, it&rsquo;s a good day,&rdquo; said Agricola, looking
      gratefully at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, my dear child!&rdquo; added the soldier, as he pressed
      Mother Bunch affectionately in his arms; then, full of impatience, he
      added: &ldquo;Come, let us go and fetch the children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my good sister!&rdquo; said Agricola, deeply moved; &ldquo;you
      will restore peace, perhaps life, to my father&mdash;and Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&mdash;but how do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere chance. And how did you come here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoil-sport stops and barks,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, who had already
      made several steps in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed the dog, who was as impatient as his master to see the orphans, and
      far better informed as to the place of their retreat, had posted himself
      at the convent gate, and was beginning to bark, to attract the attention
      of Dagobert. Understanding his dog, the latter said to the hunchback, as
      he pointed in that direction with his finger: &ldquo;The children are
      there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it. Good dog!&mdash;Oh, yes! beasts are better than
      men&mdash;except you, my dear girl, who are better than either man or
      beast. But my poor children! I shall see them, I shall have them once
      more!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Dagobert, in spite of his age, began to run very fast towards
      Spoil-sport. &ldquo;Agricola,&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, &ldquo;prevent
      thy father from knocking at that door. He would ruin all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In two strides, the smith had reached his father, just as the latter was
      raising his hand to the knocker. &ldquo;Stop, father!&rdquo; cried the
      smith, as he seized Dagobert by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch says that to knock would ruin all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will explain it to you.&rdquo; Although not so nimble as
      Agricola, Mother Bunch soon came up, and said to the soldier: &ldquo;M.
      Dagobert, do not let us remain before this gate. They might open it, and
      see us; and that would excite suspicion. Let us rather go away&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20101m.jpg" alt="20101m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20101.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspicion!&rdquo; cried the veteran, much surprised, but without
      moving from the gate; &ldquo;what suspicion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conjure you, do not remain there!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, with
      so much earnestness, that Agricola joined her, and said to his father:
      &ldquo;Since sister rashes it, father, she has some reason for it. The
      Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hopital is a few steps from here; nobody passes that
      way; we can talk there without being interrupted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take me if I understand a word of all this!&rdquo; cried
      Dagobert, without moving from his post. &ldquo;The children are here, and
      I will fetch them away with me. It is an affair of ten minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think that, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch. &ldquo;It
      is much more difficult than you imagine. But come! come!&mdash;I can hear
      them talk in the court-yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the sound of voices was now distinctly audible. &ldquo;Come
      father!&rdquo; said Agricola, forcing away the soldier, almost in spite of
      himself. Spoil-sport, who appeared much astonished at these hesitations,
      barked two or three times without quitting his post, as if to protest
      against this humiliating retreat; but, being called by Dagobert, he
      hastened to rejoin the main body.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now about five o&rsquo;clock in the evening. A high wind swept
      thick masses of grayish, rainy cloud rapidly across the sky. The Boulevard
      de l&rsquo;Hopital, which bordered on this portion of the convent-garden,
      was, as we before said, almost deserted. Dagobert, Agricola, and the
      serving girl could hold a private conference in this solitary place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier did not disguise the extreme impatience that these delays
      occasioned in him. Hardly had they turned the corner of the street, when
      he said to Mother Bunch: &ldquo;Come, my child, explain yourself. I am
      upon hot coals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house in which the daughters of Marshal Simon are confined is a
      convent, M. Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A convent!&rdquo; cried the soldier: &ldquo;I might have suspected
      it.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;Well, what then? I will fetch them from a
      convent as soon as from any other place. Once is not always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Dagobert, they are confined against their will and against
      yours. They will not give them up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not give them up? Zounds! we will see about that.&rdquo;
      And he made a step towards the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Agricola, holding him back, &ldquo;one moment&rsquo;s
      patience; let us hear all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hear nothing. What! the children are there&mdash;two steps
      from me&mdash;I know it&mdash;and I shall not have them, either by fair
      means or foul? Oh! that would indeed be curious. Let me go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, I beseech you, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch,
      taking his hand: &ldquo;there is another way to deliver these poor
      children. And that without violence&mdash;for violence, as Mdlle. de
      Cardoville told me, would ruin all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is any other way&mdash;quick&mdash;let me know it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a ring of Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is this Mdlle. de Cardoville?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;it is the generous young lady,
      who offered to be my bail, and to whom I have very important matters to
      communicate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; replied Dagobert; &ldquo;we will talk of that
      presently. Well, my dear girl&mdash;this ring?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take it directly, M. Dagobert, to the Count de Montbron,
      No. 7, Place Vendome. He appears to be a person of influence, and is a
      friend of Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s. This ring will prove that you come
      on her behalf, and you will tell him, that she is confined as a lunatic in
      the asylum next door to this convent, in which the daughters of Marshal
      Simon are detained against their will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;what next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Count de Montbron will take the proper steps with persons
      in authority, to restore both Mdlle. de Cardoville and the daughters of
      Marshal Simon to liberty&mdash;and perhaps, to-morrow, or the day after&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow or the day after!&rdquo; cried Dagobert; &ldquo;perhaps?&mdash;It
      is to-day, on the instant, that I must have them. The day after to-morrow
      would be of much use! Thanks, my good girl, but keep your ring: I will
      manage my own business. Wait for me here, my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do, father?&rdquo; cried Agricola, still
      holding back the soldier. &ldquo;It is a convent, remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are only a raw recruit; I have my theory of convents at my
      fingers&rsquo; end. In Spain, I have put it in practice a hundred times.
      Here is what will happen. I knock; a portress opens the door to me; she
      asks me what I want, but I make no answer; she tries to stop me, but I
      pass on; once in the convent, I walk over it from top to bottom, calling
      my children with all my might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Dagobert, the nuns?&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, still trying
      to detain the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nuns run after me, screaming like so many magpies. I know them.
      At Seville I fetched out an Andalusian girl, whom they were trying to keep
      by force. Well, I walk about the convent calling for Rose and Blanche.
      They hear me, and answer. If they are shut in, I take the first piece of
      furniture that comes to hand, and break open the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Dagobert&mdash;the nuns&mdash;the nuns?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nuns, with all their squalling, will not prevent my breaking
      open the door, seizing my children in my arms, and carrying them off.
      Should the outer door be shut, there will be a second smash&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all. So,&rdquo; added Dagobert, disengaging himself from the grasp,
      &ldquo;wait for me here. In ten minutes I shall be back again. Go and get
      a hackney-coach ready, my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      More calm than Dagobert, and, above all, better informed as to the
      provisions of the Penal Code, Agricola was alarmed at the consequences
      that might attend the veteran&rsquo;s strange mode of proceeding. So,
      throwing himself before him, he exclaimed: &ldquo;One word more, I entreat
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds! make haste!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you attempt to enter the convent by force, you will ruin all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, &ldquo;there
      are men in the convent. As I came out just now, I saw the porter loading
      his gun, and heard the gardener talking of his sharp scythe, and the
      rounds he was to make at night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much I care for a porter&rsquo;s gun and a gardener&rsquo;s scythe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father; but listen to me a moment, I conjure you. Suppose you
      knock, and the door is opened&mdash;the porter will ask you what you want.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell him that I wish to speak to the superior, and so walk into
      the convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, &ldquo;when once you
      have crossed the court-yard, you reach a second door, with a wicket. A nun
      comes to it, to see who rings, and does not open the door till she knows
      the object of the visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell her that I wish to see the lady superior.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father, as you are not known in the convent, they will go and
      inform the superior.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will ask you what you want, M. Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want?&mdash;the devil! my children!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute&rsquo;s patience, father. You cannot doubt, from the
      precautions they have taken, that they wish to detain these young ladies
      against their will, and against yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt! I am sure of it. To come to that point, they began by
      turning the head of my poor wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father, the superior will reply to you that she does not know
      what you mean, and that the young ladies are not in the convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will reply to her, that they are in the convent witness&mdash;Mother
      Bunch and Spoil-sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The superior will answer, that she does not know you; that she has
      no explanations to give you; and will close the wicket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I break it open&mdash;since one must come to that in the end&mdash;so
      leave me alone, I tell you! &lsquo;sblood! leave me alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, on this noise and violence, the porter will run and fetch the
      guard, and they will begin by arresting you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will become of your poor children, then, M. Dagobert?&rdquo;
      said Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola&rsquo;s father had too much good sense not to feel the truth of
      these observations of the girl and his son; but he knew also, that, cost
      what it might, the orphans must be delivered before the morrow. The
      alternative was terrible&mdash;so terrible, that, pressing his two hands
      to his burning forehead, Dagobert sunk back upon a stone bench, as if
      struck down by the inexorable fatality of the dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola and the workwoman, deeply moved by this mute despair, exchanged a
      sad look. The smith, seating himself beside the soldier, said to him:
      &ldquo;Do not be down-hearted, father. Remember what&rsquo;s been told
      you. By going with this ring of Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s to the
      influential gentleman she named, the young ladies may be free by
      to-morrow, or, at worst, by the day after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood and thunder! you want to drive me mad!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Dagobert, starting up from the bench, and looking at Mother Bunch and his
      son with so savage an expression that Agricola and the sempstress drew
      back, with an air of surprise and uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my children!&rdquo; said Dagobert, recovering himself
      after a long silence. &ldquo;I am wrong to get in a passion, for we do not
      understand one another. What you say is true; and yet I am right to speak
      as I do. Listen to me. You are an honest man, Agricola; you an honest
      girl; what I tell you is meant for you alone. I have brought these
      children from the depths of Siberia&mdash;do you know why? That they may
      be to-morrow morning in the Rue Saint-Francois. If they are not there, I
      have failed to execute the last wish of their dying mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. 3, Rue Saint Francois?&rdquo; cried Agricola, interrupting his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; how do you know the number?&rdquo; said Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the date inscribed on a bronze medal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dagobert, more end more surprised; &ldquo;who
      told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One instant, father!&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola; &ldquo;let me
      reflect. I think I guess it. Did you not tell me, my good sister, that
      Mdlle. de Cardoville was not mad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mad. They detain her in this asylum to prevent her
      communicating with any one. She believes herself, like the daughters of
      Marshal Simon, the victim of an odious machination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; cried the smith. &ldquo;I understand all
      now, Mdlle. de Cardoville has the same interest as the orphans to appear
      to-morrow at the Rue Saint-Francois. But she does not perhaps know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, my good girl. Did Mdlle. de Cardoville tell you that
      she had a powerful motive to obtain her freedom by to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for when she gave me this ring for the Count de Montbron, she
      said to me: &lsquo;By this means both I and Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters will be at liberty either to-morrow or the day after&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But explain yourself, then,&rdquo; said Dagobert to his son, with
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; replied the smith, &ldquo;when you came to seek me
      in prison, I told you, father, that I had a sacred duty to perform, and
      that I would rejoin you at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I went, on my side, to take some measures, of which I will
      speak to you presently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran instantly to the house in the Rue de Babylone, not knowing
      that Mdlle. de Cardoville was mad, or passed for mad. A servant, who
      opened the door to me, informed me that the young lady had been seized
      with a sudden attack of madness. You may conceive, father, what a blow
      that was to me! I asked where she was: they answered, that they did not
      know. I asked if I could speak to any of the family; as my jacket did not
      inspire any great confidence, they replied that none of her family were at
      present there. I was in despair, but an idea occurred to me. I said to
      myself: &lsquo;If she is mad, her family physician must know where they
      have taken her; if she is in a state to hear me, he will take me to her;
      if not, I will speak to her doctor, as I would to her relations. A doctor
      is often a friend.&rsquo; I asked the servant, therefore, to give me the
      doctor&rsquo;s address. I obtained it without difficulty&mdash;Dr.
      Baleinier, No. 12, Rue Taranne. I ran thither, but he had gone out; they
      told me that I should find him about five o&rsquo;clock at his asylum,
      which is next door to the convent. That is how we have met.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the medal&mdash;the medal?&rdquo; said Dagobert, impatiently;
      &ldquo;where did you see it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is with regard to this and other things that I wished to make
      important communications to Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are these communications?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, father, I had gone to her the day of your departure,
      to beg her to get me bail. I was followed; and when she learned this from
      her waiting-woman, she concealed me in a hiding-place. It was a sort of
      little vaulted room, in which no light was admitted, except through a
      tunnel, made like a chimney; yet in a few minutes, I could see pretty
      clearly. Having nothing better to do, I looked all about me and saw that
      the walls were covered with wainscoting. The entrance to this room was
      composed of a sliding panel, moving by means of weights and wheels
      admirably contrived. As these concern my trade, I was interested in them,
      so I examined the springs, spite of my emotion, with curiosity, and
      understood the nature of their play; but there was one brass knob, of
      which I could not discover the use. It was in vain to pull and move it
      from right to left, none of the springs were touched. I said to myself:
      &lsquo;This knob, no doubt, belongs to another piece of mechanism&rsquo;&mdash;and
      the idea occurred to me, instead of drawing it towards me, to push it with
      force. Directly after, I heard a grating sound, and perceived, just above
      the entrance to the hiding-place, one of the panels, about two feet
      square, fly open like the door of a secretary. As I had, no doubt, pushed
      the spring rather too hard, a bronze medal and chain fell out with a
      shock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you saw the address&mdash;Rue Saint-Francois?&rdquo; cried
      Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; and with this medal, a sealed letter fell to the
      ground. On picking it up, I saw that it was addressed, in large letters:
      &lsquo;For Mdlle. de Cardoville. To be opened by her the moment it is
      delivered.&rsquo; Under these words, I saw the initials &lsquo;R.&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;C.,&rsquo; accompanied by a flourish, and this date: &lsquo;Paris,
      November the 13th, 1830.&rsquo; On the other side of the envelope I
      perceived two seals, with the letters &lsquo;R.&rsquo; and &lsquo;C.,&rsquo;
      surmounted by a coronet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the seals were unbroken?&rdquo; asked Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly whole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, then, Mdlle. de Cardoville was ignorant of the existence
      of these papers,&rdquo; said the sempstress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my first idea, since she was recommended to open the
      letter immediately, and, notwithstanding this recommendation, which bore
      date two years back, the seals remained untouched.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I replaced the whole where it was before, promising myself to
      inform Mdlle. de Cardoville of it. But, a few minutes after, they entered
      my hiding-place, which had been discovered, and I did not see her again. I
      was only able to whisper a few words of doubtful meaning to one of her
      waiting-women, on the subject of what I had found, hoping thereby to
      arouse the attention of her mistress; and, as soon as I was able to write
      to you, my good sister, I begged you to go and call upon Mdlle. de
      Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this medal,&rdquo; said Dagobert, &ldquo;is exactly like that
      possessed by the daughter of Marshal Simon. How can you account for that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so plain, father. Mdlle. de Cardoville is their relation. I
      remember now, that she told me so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A relation of Rose and Blanche?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Mother Bunch; &ldquo;she told that also to me
      just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, looking anxiously at his son,
      &ldquo;do you now understand why I must have my children this very day? Do
      you now understand, as their poor mother told me on her death-bed, that
      one day&rsquo;s delay might ruin all? Do you now see that I cannot be
      satisfied with a perhaps to-morrow, when I have come all the way from
      Siberia, only, that those children might be to-morrow in the Rue
      Saint-Francois? Do you at last perceive that I must have them this night,
      even if I have to set fire to the convent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, if you employ violence&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds! do you know what the commissary of police answered me this
      morning, when I went to renew my charge against your mother&rsquo;s
      confessor? He said to me that there was no proof, and that they could do
      nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now there is proof, father, for at least we know where the
      young girls are. With that certainty we shall be strong. The law is more
      powerful than all the superiors of convents in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Count de Montbron, to whom Mdlle. de Cardoville begs you to
      apply,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, &ldquo;is a man of influence. Tell him
      the reasons that make it so important for these young ladies, as well as
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, to be at liberty this evening and he will certainly
      hasten the course of justice, and to-night your children will be restored
      to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister is in the right, father. Go to the Count. Meanwhile, I will
      run to the commissary, and tell him that we now know where the young girls
      are confined. Do you go home, and wait for us, my good girl. We will meet
      at our own house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert had remained plunged in thought; suddenly, he said to Agricola:
      &ldquo;Be it so. I will follow your counsel. But suppose the commissary
      says to you: &lsquo;We cannot act before to-morrow&rsquo;&mdash;suppose
      the Count de Montbron says to me the same thing&mdash;do not think I shall
      stand with my arms folded until the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; resumed the soldier in an abrupt voice:
      &ldquo;I have made up my mind. Run to the commissary, my boy; wait for us
      at home, my good girl; I will go to the Count. Give me the ring. Now for
      the address!&rdquo;
    </p>

      &ldquo;The Count de Montbron, No. 7, Place Vendome,&rdquo; said she;
      &ldquo;you come on behalf of Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good memory,&rdquo; answered the soldier. &ldquo;We will
      meet as soon as possible in the Rue Brise-Miche.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; have good courage. You will see that the law protects
      and defends honest people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said the soldier; &ldquo;because,
      otherwise, honest people would be obliged to protect and defend
      themselves. Farewell, my children! we will meet soon in the Rue
      Brise-Miche.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE MEETING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is eight o&rsquo;clock
      in the evening, the rain dashes against the windows of Frances Baudoin&rsquo;s
      apartment in the Rue Brise-Miche, while violent squalls of wind shake the
      badly dosed doors and casements. The disorder and confusion of this humble
      abode, usually kept with so much care and neatness, bore testimony to the
      serious nature of the sad events which had thus disturbed existences
      hitherto peaceful in their obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paved floor was soiled with mud, and a thick layer of dust covered the
      furniture, once so bright and clean. Since Frances was taken away by the
      commissary, the bed had not been made; at night Dagobert had thrown
      himself upon it for a few hours in his clothes, when, worn out with
      fatigue, and crushed by despair, he had returned from new and vain
      attempts to discover Rose and Blanche&rsquo;s prison-house. Upon the
      drawers stood a bottle, a glass, and some fragments of dry bread, proving
      the frugality of the soldier, whose means of subsistence were reduced to
      the money lent by the pawnbroker upon the things pledged by Mother Bunch,
      after the arrest of Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the faint glimmer of a candle, placed upon the little stove, now cold
      as marble, for the stock of wood had long been exhausted, one might have
      seen the hunchback sleeping upon a chair, her head resting on her bosom,
      her hands concealed beneath her cotton apron, and her feet resting on the
      lowest rung of the chair; from time to time, she shivered in her damp,
      chill garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that long day of fatigue and diverse emotions, the poor creature had
      eaten nothing. Had she even thought of it, she would have been at a loss
      for bread. Waiting for the return of Dagobert and Agricola, she had sunk
      into an agitated sleep&mdash;very different, alas! from calm and
      refreshing slumber. From time to time, she half opened her eyes uneasily,
      and looked around her. Then, again, overcome by irresistible heaviness,
      her head fell upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes of silence, only interrupted by the noise of the wind,
      a slow and heavy step was heard on the landing-place. The door opened, and
      Dagobert entered, followed by Spoil-sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waking with a start, Mother Bunch raised her head hastily, sprang from her
      chair, and, advancing rapidly to meet Agricola&rsquo;s father, said to
      him: &ldquo;Well, M. Dagobert! have you good news? Have you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not continue, she was so struck with the gloomy expression of
      the soldier&rsquo;s features. Absorbed in his reflections, he did not at
      first appear to perceive the speaker, but threw himself despondingly on a
      chair, rested his elbows upon the table, and hid his face in his hands.
      After a long meditation, he rose, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;It must&mdash;yes,
      it must be done!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a few steps up and down the room, Dagobert looked around him, as if
      in search of something. At length, after about a minute&rsquo;s
      examination, he perceived near the stove, a bar of iron, perhaps two feet
      long, serving to lift the covers, when too hot for the fingers. Taking
      this in his hand, he looked at it closely, poised it to judge of its
      weight, and then laid it down upon the drawers with an air of
      satisfaction. Surprised at the long silence of Dagobert, the needlewoman
      followed his movements with timid and uneasy curiosity. But soon her
      surprise gave way to fright, when she saw the soldier take down his
      knapsack, place it upon a chair, open it, and draw from it a pair of
      pocket-pistols, the locks of which he tried with the utmost caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seized with terror, the sempstress could not forbear exclaiming: &ldquo;Good
      gracious, M. Dagobert! what are you going to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier looked at her as if he only now perceived her for the first
      time, and said to her in a cordial, but abrupt voice: &ldquo;Good-evening,
      my good girl! What is the time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock has just struck at Saint-Mery&rsquo;s, M.
      Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the soldier, speaking to himself;
      &ldquo;only eight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the pistols by the side of the iron bar, he appeared again to
      reflect, while he cast his eyes around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert,&rdquo; ventured the girl, &ldquo;you have not, then,
      good news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That single word was uttered by the soldier in so sharp a tone, that, not
      daring to question him further, Mother Bunch sat down in silence. Spoil
      sport came to lean his head on the knees of the girl, and followed the
      movements of Dagobert with as much curiosity as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After remaining for some moments pensive and silent, the soldier
      approached the bed, took a sheet from it, appeared to measure its length,
      and then said, turning towards Mother Bunch: &ldquo;The scissors!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Dagobert&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my good girl! the scissors!&rdquo; replied Dagobert, in a
      kind tone, but one that commanded obedience. The sempstress took the
      scissors from Frances&rsquo; work-basket, and presented them to the
      soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, hold the other end of the sheet, my girl, and draw it out
      tight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, Dagobert had cut the sheet into four strips, which he
      twisted in the fashion of cords, fastening them here and there with bits
      of tape, so as to preserve the twist, and tying them strongly together, so
      as to make a rope of about twenty feet long. This, however, did not
      suffice him, for he said to himself: &ldquo;Now I must have a hook.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he looked around him, and Mother Bunch, more and more frightened,
      for she now no longer doubted Dagobert&rsquo;s designs, said to him
      timidly: &ldquo;M. Dagobert, Agricola has not yet come in. It may be some
      good news that makes him so late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the soldier, bitterly, as he continued to cast
      round his eyes in search of something he wanted; &ldquo;good news like
      mine! But I must have a strong iron hook.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still looking about, he found one of the coarse, gray sacks, that Frances
      was accustomed to make. He took it, opened it, and said to the work girl:
      &ldquo;Put me the iron bar and the cord into this bag, my girl. It will be
      easier to carry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried she, obeying his directions; &ldquo;you will
      not go without seeing Agricola, M. Dagobert? He may perhaps have some good
      news to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied! I shall wait for my boy. I need not start before ten
      o&rsquo;clock&mdash;so I have time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, M. Dagobert! have you last all hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. I have good hope&mdash;but in myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Dagobert twisted the upper end of the sack, for the purpose of
      closing it, and placed it on the drawers, by the side of his pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, you will wait for Agricola, M. Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if he arrives before ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas; you have then quite made up your mind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. And yet, if I were weak enough to believe in bad omens&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, M. Dagobert, omens do not deceive one,&rdquo; said the
      girl, hoping to induce the soldier to abandon his dangerous resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert; &ldquo;old women say so&mdash;and,
      although I am not an old woman, what I saw just now weighed heavily on my
      heart. After all, I may have taken a feeling of anger for a presentiment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell it you, my good girl; it may help to pass the time,
      which appears long enough.&rdquo; Then, interrupting himself, he
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Was it the half hour that just struck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. Dagobert; it is half-past eight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still an hour and a half,&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a hollow voice.
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is what I saw. As I came along the
      street, my notice was attracted by a large red placard, at the head of
      which was a black panther devouring a white horse. That sight gave me a
      turn, for you must know, my good girl, that a black panther destroyed a
      poor old white horse that I had, Spoil-sport&rsquo;s companion, whose name
      was Jovial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of this name, once so familiar, Spoil-sport, who was
      crouching at the workwoman&rsquo;s feet, raised his head hastily, and
      looked at Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that beasts have memory&mdash;he recollects,&rdquo; said
      the soldier, sighing himself at the remembrance. Then, addressing his dog
      he added: &ldquo;Dost remember Jovial?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this name a second time pronounced by his master, in a voice of
      emotion, Spoil-sport gave a low whine, as if to indicate that he had not
      forgotten his old travelling companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, indeed, a melancholy incident, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said
      Mother Bunch, &ldquo;to find upon this placard a panther devouring a
      horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing to what&rsquo;s to come; you shall hear the rest. I
      drew near the bill, and read in it, that one Morok, just arrived from
      Germany, is about to exhibit in a theatre different wild beasts that he
      tamed, among others a splendid lion, a tiger, and a black Java panther
      named Death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful name!&rdquo; said the hearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think it more awful, my child, when I tell you, that this
      is the very panther which strangled my horse at Leipsic, four months ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven! you are right, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said the girl,
      &ldquo;it is awful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little,&rdquo; said Dagobert, whose countenance was growing
      more and more gloomy, &ldquo;that is not all. It was by means of this very
      Morok, the owner of the panther, that I and my poor children were
      imprisoned in Leipsic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this wicked man is in Paris, and wishes you evil?&rdquo; said
      Mother Bunch. &ldquo;Oh! you are right, M. Dagobert; you must take care of
      yourself; it is a bad omen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For him, if I catch him,&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a hollow tone.
      &ldquo;We have old accounts to settle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert,&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, listening; &ldquo;some one
      is running up the stairs. It is Agricola&rsquo;s footsteps. I am sure he
      has good news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will just do,&rdquo; said the soldier, hastily, without
      answering. &ldquo;Agricola is a smith. He will be able to find me the iron
      hook.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after, Agricola entered the room; but, alas! the sempstress
      perceived at the first glance, in the dejected countenance of the workman,
      the ruin of her cherished hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Dagobert to his son, in a tone which clearly
      announced the little faith he attached to the steps taken by Agricola;
      &ldquo;well, what news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, it is enough to drive one mad&mdash;to make one dash one&rsquo;s
      brains out against the wall!&rdquo; cried the smith in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert turned towards Mother Bunch, and said: &ldquo;You see, my poor
      child&mdash;I was sure of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; cried Agricola; &ldquo;have you seen the Court
      de Montbron?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count de Montbron set out for Lorraine three days ago. That is
      my good news,&rdquo; continued the soldier, with bitter irony; &ldquo;let
      us have yours&mdash;I long to know all. I need to know, if, on appealing
      to the laws, which, as you told me, protect and defend honest people, it
      ever happens that the rogues get the best of it. I want to know this, and
      then I want an iron hook&mdash;so I count upon you for both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, tell me what you have done. We have time. It is not much
      more than half-past eight. On leaving me, where did you go first?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the commissary, who had already received your depositions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After having very kindly listened to all I had to state, he
      answered, that these young girls were placed in a respectable house, a
      convent&mdash;so that there did not appear any urgent necessity for their
      immediate removal&mdash;and besides, he could not take upon himself to
      violate the sanctity of a religious dwelling upon your simple testimony;
      to-morrow, he will make his report to the proper authorities, and steps
      will be taken accordingly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;plenty of put offs,&rdquo; said the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But, sir,&rsquo; answered I to him,&rdquo; resumed Agricola,
      &ldquo;&lsquo;it is now, this very night, that you ought to act, for if
      these young girls should not be present to-morrow morning in the Rue Saint
      Francois, their interests may suffer incalculable damage. &lsquo;I am very
      sorry for it,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;but I cannot, upon your simple
      declaration, or that of your father, who&mdash;like yourself&mdash;is no
      relation or connection of these young persons, act in direct opposition to
      forms, which could not be set aside, even on the demand of a family. The
      law has its delays and its formalities, to which we are obliged to submit.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;We must submit to them, at
      the risk of becoming cowardly, ungrateful traitors!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didst speak also of Mdlle. de Cardoville to him?&rdquo; asked the
      work-girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but he: answered me on this subject in much the same
      manner: &lsquo;It was very serious; there was no proof in support of my
      deposition. A third party had told me that Mdlle. de Cardoville affirms
      she was not mad; but all mad people pretend to be sane. He could not,
      therefore, upon my sole testimony, take upon himself to enter the house of
      a respectable physician. But he would report upon it, and the law would
      have its course&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I wished to act just now for myself,&rdquo; said Dagobert,
      &ldquo;did I not forsee all this? And yet I was weak enough to listen to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, what you wished to attempt was impossible, and you
      agreed that it would expose you to far too dangerous consequences.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; resumed the soldier, without answering his son, &ldquo;they
      told you in plain terms, that we must not think of obtaining legally the
      release of Rose and Blanche this evening or even to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father. In the eyes of the law, there is no special urgency.
      The question may not be decided for two or three days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I wished to know,&rdquo; said Dagobert, rising and
      walking up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; resumed his son, &ldquo;I did not consider myself
      beaten. In despair, but believing that justice could not remain deaf to
      such equitable claims, I ran to the Palais de Justice, hoping to find
      there a judge, a magistrate who would receive my complaint, and act upon
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the soldier, stopping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told that the courts shut every day at five o&rsquo;clock,
      and do not open again til ten in the morning. Thinking of your despair,
      and of the position of poor Mdlle. de Cardoville, I determined to make one
      more attempt. I entered a guard-house of troops of the line, commanded by
      a lieutenant. I told him all. He saw that I was so much moved, and I spoke
      with such warmth and conviction, that he became interested.&mdash;&lsquo;Lieutenant,&rsquo;
      said I to him, &lsquo;grant me one favor; let a petty officer and two
      soldiers go to the convent to obtain a legal entrance. Let them ask to see
      the daughters of Marshal Simon, and learn whether it is their choice to
      remain, or return to my father, who brought them from Russia. You will
      then see if they are not detained against their will&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what answer did he give you, Agricola?&rdquo; asked Mother
      Bunch, while Dagobert shrugged his shoulders, and continued to walk up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what you ask me is
      impossible. I understand your motives, but I cannot take upon myself so
      serious a measure. I should be broke were I to enter a convent by force.&mdash;&lsquo;Then,
      sir, what am I to do? It is enough to turn one&rsquo;s head.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Faith,
      I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the lieutenant; &lsquo;it will be safest,
      I think, to wait.&rsquo;&mdash;Then, believing I had done all that was
      possible, father, I resolved to come back, in the hope that you might have
      been more fortunate than I&mdash;but, alas! I was deceived!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the smith sank upon a chair, for he was worn out with anxiety
      and fatigue. There was a moment of profound silence after these words of
      Agricola, which destroyed the last hopes of the three, mute and crushed
      beneath the strokes of inexorable fatality.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new incident came to deepen the sad and painful character of this scene.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. DISCOVERIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he door which
      Agricola had not thought of fastening opened, as it were, timidly, and
      Frances Baudoin, Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, pale, sinking, hardly able to
      support herself, appeared on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, Agricola, and Mother Bunch, were plunged in such deep
      dejection, that neither of them at first perceived the entrance. Frances
      advanced two steps into the room, fell upon her knees, clasped her hands
      together, and said in a weak and humble voice; &ldquo;My poor husband&mdash;pardon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Agricola and the work-girl&mdash;whose backs were towards
      the door&mdash;turned round suddenly, and Dagobert hastily raised his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; cried Agricola, running to Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, as he also rose, and advanced to
      meet the unfortunate woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your knees, dear mother!&rdquo; said Agricola, stooping down to
      embrace her affectionately. &ldquo;Get up, I entreat you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my child,&rdquo; said Frances, in her mild, firm accents,
      &ldquo;I will not rise, till your father has forgiven me. I have wronged
      him much&mdash;now I know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you, my poor wife?&rdquo; said the soldier, as he drew near
      with emotion. &ldquo;Have I ever accused you, except in my first transport
      of despair? No, no; it was the bad priests that I accused, and there I was
      right. Well! I have you again,&rdquo; added he, assisting his son to raise
      Frances; &ldquo;one grief the less. They have then restored you to
      liberty? Yesterday, I could not even learn in what prison they had put
      you. I have so many cares that I could not think of you only. But come,
      dear wife: sit down!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How feeble you are, dear mother!&mdash;how cold&mdash;how pale!&rdquo;
      said Agricola with anguish, his eyes filling with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not let us know?&rdquo; added he. &ldquo;We would have
      gone to fetch you. But how you tremble! Your hands are frozen!&rdquo;
      continued the smith, as he knelt down before Frances. Then, turning
      towards Mother Bunch: &ldquo;Pray, make a little fire directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of it, as soon as your father came in, Agricola, but
      there is no wood nor charcoal left.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then pray borrow some of Father Loriot, my dear sister. He is too
      good a fellow to refuse. My poor mother trembles so&mdash;she might fall
      ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he said the words, than Mother Bunch went out. The smith rose
      from the ground, took the blanket from the bed, and carefully wrapped it
      about the knees and feet of his mother. Then, again kneeling down, he said
      to her: &ldquo;Your hands, dear mother!&rdquo; and, taking those feeble
      palms in his own, he tried to warm them with his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more touching than this picture: the robust young man,
      with his energetic and resolute countenance, expressing by his looks the
      greatest tenderness, and paying the most delicate attentions to his poor,
      pale, trembling old mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, kind-hearted as his son, went to fetch a pillow, and brought it
      to his wife, saying: &ldquo;Lean forward a little, and I will put this
      pillow behind you; you will be more comfortable and warmer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you both spoil me!&rdquo; said Frances, trying to smile.
      &ldquo;And you to be so kind, after all the ill I have done!&rdquo; added
      she to Dagobert, as, disengaging one of her hands from those of her son,
      she took the soldier&rsquo;s hand and pressed it to her tearful eyes.
      &ldquo;In prison,&rdquo; said she in a low voice, &ldquo;I had time to
      repent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola&rsquo;s heart was near breaking at the thought that his pious and
      good mother, with her angelic purity, should for a moment have been
      confined in prison with so many miserable creatures. He would have made
      some attempt to console her on the subject of the painful past, but he
      feared to give a new shock to Dagobert, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Gabriel, dear mother?&rdquo; inquired he. &ldquo;How is
      he? As you have seen him, tell us all about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Gabriel,&rdquo; said Frances, drying her tears; &ldquo;he
      is confined at home. His superiors have rigorously forbidden his going
      out. Luckily, they did not prevent his receiving me, for his words and
      counsels have opened my eyes to many things. It is from him that I learned
      how guilty I had been to you, my poor husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know that if I caused you so much grief, it was not from
      wickedness. When I saw you in such despair, I suffered almost as much
      myself; but I durst not tell you so, for fear of breaking my oath. I had
      resolved to keep it, believing that I did well, believing that it was my
      duty. And yet something told me that it could not be my duty to cause you
      so much pain. &lsquo;Alas, my God! enlighten me!&rsquo; I exclaimed in my
      prison, as I knelt down and prayed, in spite of the mockeries of the other
      women. &lsquo;Why should a just and pious work, commanded by my confessor,
      the most respectable of men, overwhelm me and mine with so much misery?
      &lsquo;Have mercy on me, my God, and teach me if I have done wrong without
      knowing it!&rsquo; As I prayed with fervor, God heard me, and inspired me
      with the idea of applying to Gabriel. &lsquo;I thank Thee, Father! I will
      obey!&rsquo; said I within myself. &lsquo;Gabriel is like my own child;
      but he is also a priest, a martyr&mdash;almost a saint. If any one in the
      world imitates the charity of our blessed Saviour, it is surely he. When I
      leave this prison, I will go and consult him and he will clear up my
      doubts.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, dear mother,&rdquo; cried Agricola; &ldquo;it was a
      thought from heaven. Gabriel is an angel of purity, courage, nobleness&mdash;the
      type of the true and good priest!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, poor wife!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with bitterness; &ldquo;if you
      had never had any confessor but Gabriel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of it before he went on his journey,&rdquo; said Frances,
      with simplicity. &ldquo;I should have liked to confess to the dear boy&mdash;but
      I fancied Abbe Dubois would be offended, and that Gabriel would be too
      indulgent with regard to my sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sins, poor dear mother?&rdquo; said Agricola. &ldquo;As if you
      ever committed any!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did Gabriel tell you?&rdquo; asked the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear! had I but had such an interview with him sooner!
      What I told him of Abbe Dubois roused his suspicions, and he questioned
      me, dear child, as to many things of which he had never spoken to me
      before. Then I opened to him my whole heart, and he did the same to me,
      and we both made sad discoveries with regard to persons whom we had always
      thought very respectable, and who yet had deceived each of us, unknown to
      the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they used to tell him, under the seal of secrecy, things that
      were supposed to come from me; and they used to tell me, under the same
      seal of secrecy, things that were supposed to come from him. Thus, he
      confessed to me, that he did not feel at first any vocation for the
      priesthood; but they told him that I should not believe myself safe in
      this world or in the next, if he did not take orders, because I felt
      persuaded that I could best serve the Lord by giving Him so good a
      servant; and that yet I had never dared to ask Gabriel himself to give me
      this proof of his attachment, though I had taken him from the street, a
      deserted orphan, and brought him up as my own son, at the cost of labor
      and privations. Then, how could it be otherwise? The poor dear child,
      thinking he could please me, sacrificed himself. He entered the seminary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible,&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis an infamous
      snare, and, for the priests who were guilty of it, a sacrilegious lie!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During all that time,&rdquo; resumed Frances, &ldquo;they were
      holding very different language to me. I was told that Gabriel felt his
      vocation, but that he durst not avow it to me, for fear of my being
      jealous on account of Agricola, who, being brought up as a workman, would
      not enjoy the same advantages as those which the priesthood would secure
      to Gabriel. So when he asked my permission to enter the seminary dear
      child! he entered it with regret, but he thought he was making me so
      happy!&mdash;instead of discouraging this idea, I did all in my power to
      persuade him to follow it, assuring him that he could not do better, and
      that it would occasion me great joy. You understand, I exaggerated, for
      fear he should think me jealous on account of Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an odious machination!&rdquo; said Agricola, in amazement.
      &ldquo;They were speculating in this unworthy manner upon your mutual
      devotion. Thus Gabriel saw the expression of your dearest wish in the
      almost forced encouragement given to his resolution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little by little, however, as Gabriel has the best heart in the
      world, the vocation really came to him. That was natural enough&mdash;he
      was born to console those who suffer, and devote himself for the
      unfortunate. He would never have spoken to me of the past, had it not been
      for this morning&rsquo;s interview. But then I beheld him, who is usually
      so mild and gentle, become indignant, exasperated, against M. Rodin and
      another person whom he accuses. He had serious complaints against them
      already, but these discoveries, he says, will make up the measure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words of Frances, Dagobert pressed his hand to his forehead, as
      if to recall something to his memory. For some minutes he had listened
      with surprise, and almost terror, to the account of these secret plots,
      conducted with such deep and crafty dissimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances continued: &ldquo;When at last I acknowledged to Gabriel, that by
      the advice of Abbe Dubois, my confessor, I had delivered to a stranger the
      children confined to my husband&mdash;General Simon&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;the
      dear boy blamed me, though with great regret, not for having wished to
      instruct the poor orphans in the truths of our holy religion, but for
      having acted without the consent of my husband, who alone was answerable
      before God and man for the charge entrusted to him. Gabriel severely
      censured Abbe Dubois&rsquo; conduct, who had given me, he said, bad and
      perfidious counsels; and then, with the sweetness of an angel, the dear
      boy consoled me, and exhorted me to come and tell you all. My poor
      husband! he would fain have accompanied me, for I had scarcely courage to
      come hither, so strongly did I feel the wrong I had done you; but,
      unfortunately, Gabriel is confined at the seminary by the strict order of
      his superiors; he could not come with me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Dagobert, who seemed much agitated, abruptly interrupted his wife.
      &ldquo;One word, Frances,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for, in truth, in the
      midst of so many cares, and black, diabolical plots, one loses one&rsquo;s
      memory, and the head begins to wander. Didst not tell me, the day the
      children disappeared, that Gabriel, when taken in by you, had round his
      neck a bronze medal, and in his pocket a book filled with papers in a
      foreign language?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this medal and these papers were afterwards delivered to your
      confessor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gabriel never spoke of them since?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola, hearing this from his mother, looked at her with surprise, and
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Then Gabriel has the same interest as the daughters of
      General Simon, or Mdlle. de Cardoville, to be in the Rue Saint-Francois
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;And now do you remember
      what he said to us, just after my arrival&mdash;that, in a few days, he
      would need our support in a serious matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is kept a prisoner at his seminary! And he tells your mother
      that he has to complain of his superiors! and he asked us for our support
      with so sad and grave an air, that I said to him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would speak so, if about to engage in a deadly duel,&rdquo;
      interrupted Agricola. &ldquo;True, father! and yet you, who are a good
      judge of valor, acknowledged that Gabriel&rsquo;s courage was equal to
      yours. For him so to fear his superiors, the danger must be great indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I have heard your mother, I understand it all,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert. &ldquo;Gabriel is like Rose and Blanche, like Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, like your mother, like all of us, perhaps&mdash;the victim of
      a secret conspiracy of wicked priests. Now that I know their dark
      machinations, their infernal perseverance, I see,&rdquo; added the
      soldier, in a whisper, &ldquo;that it requires strength to struggle
      against them. I had not the least idea of their power.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, father; for those who are hypocritical and wicked do
      as much harm as those who are good and charitable, like Gabriel, do good.
      There is no more implacable enemy than a bad priest.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, and that&rsquo;s what frightens me; for my poor children
      are in their hands. But is all lost? Shall I bring myself to give them up
      without an effort? Oh, no, no! I will not show any weakness&mdash;and yet,
      since your mother told us of these diabolical plots, I do not know how it
      is but I seem less strong, less resolute. What is passing around me
      appears so terrible. The spiriting away of these children is no longer an
      isolated fact&mdash;it is one of the ramifications of a vast conspiracy,
      which surrounds and threatens us all. It seems to me as if I and those I
      love walked together in darkness, in the midst of serpents, in the midst
      of snares that we can neither see nor struggle against. Well! I&rsquo;ll
      speak out! I have never feared death&mdash;I am not a coward and yet I
      confess&mdash;yes, I confess it&mdash;these black robes frighten me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert pronounced these words in so sincere a tone, that his son
      started, for he shared the same impression. And it was quite natural.
      Frank, energetic, resolute characters, accustomed to act and fight in the
      light of day, never feel but one fear&mdash;and that is, to be ensnared
      and struck in the dark by enemies that escape their grasp. Thus, Dagobert
      had encountered death twenty times; and yet, on hearing his wife&rsquo;s
      simple revelation of this dark tissue of lies, and treachery, and crime,
      the soldier felt a vague sense of fear; and, though nothing was changed in
      the conditions of his nocturnal enterprise against the convent, it now
      appeared to him in a darker and more dangerous light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence, which had reigned for some moments, was interrupted by Mother
      Bunch&rsquo;s return. The latter, knowing that the interview between
      Dagobert, his wife, and Agricola, ought not have any importunate witness,
      knocked lightly at the door, and remained in the passage with Father
      Loriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we come in, Mme. Frances?&rdquo; asked the sempstress. &ldquo;Here
      is Father Loriot, bringing some wood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; come in, my good girl,&rdquo; said Agricola, whilst his
      father wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and the worthy dyer appeared, with his hands and arms of
      an amaranthine color; on one side, he carried a basket of wood, and on the
      other some live coal in a shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening to the company!&rdquo; said Daddy Loriot. &ldquo;Thank
      you for having thought of me, Mme. Frances. You know that my shop and
      everything in it are at your service. Neighbors should help one another;
      that&rsquo;s my motto! You were kind enough, I should think, to my late
      wife!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, placing the wood in a corner, and giving the shovel to Agricola, the
      worthy dyer, guessing from the sorrowful appearance of the different
      actors in this scene, that it would be impolite to prolong his visit,
      added: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want anything else, Mme. Frances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Father Loriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, good-evening to the company!&rdquo; said the dyer; and,
      addressing Mother Bunch, he added: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the letter
      for M. Dagobert. I durstn&rsquo;t touch it for fear of leaving the marks
      of my four fingers and thumb in amaranthine! But, good evening to the
      company!&rdquo; and Father Loriot went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert, here is a letter,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch. She set
      herself to light the fire in the stove, while Agricola drew his mother&rsquo;s
      arm-chair to the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what it is, my boy,&rdquo; said Dagobert to his son; &ldquo;my
      head is so heavy that I cannot see clear.&rdquo; Agricola took the letter,
      which contained only a few lines, and read it before he looked at the
      signature.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;At Sea, December 25th, 1831.

     &ldquo;I avail myself of a few minutes&rsquo; communication with a ship bound
     direct for Europe, to write to you, my old comrade, a few hasty
     lines, which will reach you probably by way of Havre, before the
     arrival of my last letters from India. You must by this time be at
     Paris, with my wife and child&mdash;tell them&mdash;I am unable to say more
     &mdash;the boat is departing. Only one word; I shall soon be in France.
     Do not forget the 13th February; the future of my wife and child
     depends upon it.

     &ldquo;Adieu, my friend! Believe in my eternal gratitude.

     &ldquo;SIMON.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola&mdash;quick! look to your father!&rdquo; cried the
      hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first words of this letter, which present circumstances made so
      cruelly applicable, Dagobert had become deadly pale. Emotion, fatigue,
      exhaustion, joined to this last blow, made him stagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son hastened to him, and supported him in his arms. But soon the
      momentary weakness passed away, and Dagobert, drawing his hand across his
      brow, raised his tall figure to its full height. Then, whilst his eye
      sparkled, his rough countenance took an expression of determined
      resolution, and he exclaimed, in wild excitement: &ldquo;No, no! I will
      not be a traitor; I will not be a coward. The black robes shall not
      frighten me; and, this night, Rose and Blanche Simon shall be free!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. THE PENAL CODE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>tartled for a
      moment by the dark and secret machinations of the black robes, as he
      called them, against the persons he most loved, Dagobert might have
      hesitated an instant to attempt the deliverance of Rose and Blanche; but
      his indecision ceased directly on the reading of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      letter, which came so timely to remind him of his sacred duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the soldier&rsquo;s passing dejection had succeeded a resolution full
      of calm and collected energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, what o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo; asked he of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just struck nine, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make me, directly, an iron hook&mdash;strong enough to
      support my weight, and wide enough to hold on the coping of a wall. This
      stove will be forge and anvil; you will find a hammer in the house; and,
      for iron,&rdquo; said the soldier, hesitating, and looking around him,
      &ldquo;as for iron&mdash;here is some!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the soldier took from the hearth a strong pair of tongs, and
      presented them to his son, adding: &ldquo;Come, my boy! blow up the fire,
      blow it to a white heat, and forge me this iron!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, Frances and Agricola looked at each other with surprise;
      the smith remained mute and confounded, not knowing the resolution of his
      father, and the preparations he had already commenced with the needlewoman&rsquo;s
      aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear me, Agricola,&rdquo; repeated Dagobert, still
      holding the pair of tongs in his hand; &ldquo;you must make me a hook
      directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hook, father?&mdash;for what purpose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tie to the end of a cord that I have here. There must be a loop
      at one end large enough to fix it securely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this cord&mdash;this hook&mdash;for what purpose are they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To scale the walls of the convent, if I cannot get in by the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What convent?&rdquo; asked Frances of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, father?&rdquo; cried the latter, rising abruptly. &ldquo;You
      still think of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what else should I think of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, it is impossible; you will never attempt such an
      enterprise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my child?&rdquo; asked Frances, with anxiety. &ldquo;Where
      is father going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going to break into the convent where Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters are confined, and carry them off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! my poor husband&mdash;a sacrilege!&rdquo; cried Frances,
      faithful to her pious traditions, and, clasping her hands together, she
      endeavored to rise and approach Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, forseeing that he would have to contend with observations and
      prayers of all sorts, and resolved not to yield, determined to cut short
      all useless supplications, which would only make him lose precious time.
      He said, therefore, with a grave, severe, and almost solemn air, which
      showed the inflexibility of his determination: &ldquo;Listen to me, wife&mdash;and
      you also, my son&mdash;when, at my age, a man makes up his mind to do
      anything, he knows the reason why. And when a man has once made up his
      mind, neither wife nor child can alter it. I have resolved to do my duty;
      so spare yourselves useless words. It may be your duty to talk to me as
      you have done; but it is over now, and we will say no more about it. This
      evening I must be master in my own house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timid and alarmed, Frances did not dare to utter a word, but she turned a
      supplicating glance towards her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;one word more&mdash;only
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear,&rdquo; replied Dagobert, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not combat your resolution; but I will prove to you that you
      do not know to what you expose yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it all,&rdquo; replied the soldier, in an abrupt tone.
      &ldquo;The undertaking is a serious one; but it shall not be said that I
      neglected any means to accomplish what I promised to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But father, you do not know to what danger you expose yourself,&rdquo;
      said the smith, much alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of danger! talk of the porter&rsquo;s gun and the gardener&rsquo;s
      scythe!&rdquo; said Dagobert, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously.
      &ldquo;Talk of them, and have done with it for, after all, suppose I were
      to leave my carcass in the convent, would not you remain to your mother?
      For twenty years, you were accustomed to do without me. It will be all the
      less trying to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, alas! am the cause of these misfortunes!&rdquo; cried the
      poor mother. &ldquo;Ah! Gabriel had good reason to blame me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mme. Frances, be comforted,&rdquo; whispered the sempstress, who
      had drawn near to Dagobert&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Agricola will not suffer
      his father to expose himself thus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the smith resumed, in an agitated
      voice: &ldquo;I know you too well, father, to think of stopping you by the
      fear of death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what danger, then, do you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a danger from which even you will shrink, brave as you are,&rdquo;
      said the young man, in a voice of emotion, that forcibly struck his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola,&rdquo; said the soldier, roughly and severely, &ldquo;that
      remark is cowardly, you are insulting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowardly!&rdquo; resumed the soldier, angrily; &ldquo;because it is
      cowardice to wish to frighten a man from his duty&mdash;insulting! because
      you think me capable of being so frightened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Dagobert!&rdquo; exclaimed the sewing-girl, &ldquo;you do
      not understand Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand him too well,&rdquo; answered the soldier harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Painfully affected by the severity of his father, but firm in his
      resolution, which sprang from love and respect, Agricola resumed, whilst
      his heart beat violently. &ldquo;Forgive me, if I disobey you, father;
      but, were you to hate me for it, I must tell you to what you expose
      yourself by scaling at night the walls of a convent&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son! do you dare?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, his countenance
      inflamed with rage-&ldquo;Agricola!&rdquo; exclaimed Frances, in tears.
      &ldquo;My husband!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert, listen to Agricola!&rdquo; exclaimed Mother Bunch.
      &ldquo;It is only in your interest that he speaks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one word more!&rdquo; replied the soldier, stamping his foot
      with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, father,&rdquo; exclaimed the smith, growing fearfully
      pale as he spoke, &ldquo;that you risk being sent to the galleys!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy boy!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, seizing his son by the arm;
      &ldquo;could you not keep that from me&mdash;rather than expose me to
      become a traitor and a coward?&rdquo; And the soldier shuddered, as he
      repeated: &ldquo;The galleys!&rdquo;&mdash;and, bending down his head,
      remained mute, pensive, withered, as it were, by those blasting words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to enter an inhabited place by night, in such a manner, is
      what the law calls burglary, and punishes with the galleys,&rdquo; cried
      Agricola, at once grieved and rejoicing at his father&rsquo;s depression
      of mind&mdash;&ldquo;yes, father, the galleys, if you are taken in the
      act; and there are ten chances to one that you would be so. Mother Bunch
      has told you, the convent is guarded. This morning, had you attempted to
      carry off the two young ladies in broad daylight, you would have been
      arrested; but, at least, the attempt would have been an open one, with a
      character of honest audacity about it, that hereafter might have procured
      your acquittal. But to enter by night, and by scaling the walls&mdash;I
      tell you, the galleys would be the consequence. Now, father, decide.
      Whatever you do, I will do also&mdash;for you shall not go alone. Say but
      the word, and I will forge the hook for you&mdash;I have here hammer and
      pincers&mdash;and in an hour we will set out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence followed these words&mdash;a silence that was only
      interrupted by the stifled sobs of Frances, who muttered to herself in
      despair: &ldquo;Alas! this is the consequence of listening to Abbe Dubois!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Mother Bunch tried to console Frances. She was herself
      alarmed, for the soldier was capable of braving even infamy, and Agricola
      had determined to share the perils of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his energetic and resolute character, Dagobert remained for
      some time in a kind of stupor. According to his military habits, he had
      looked at this nocturnal enterprise only as a ruse de guerre, authorized
      by his good cause, and by the inexorable fatality of his position; but the
      words of his son brought him back to the fearful reality, and left him the
      choice of a terrible alternative&mdash;either to betray the confidence of
      Marshal Simon, and set at naught the last wishes of the mother of the
      orphan&mdash;or else to expose himself, and above all his son, to lasting
      disgrace&mdash;without even the certainty of delivering the orphans after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drying her eyes, bathed in tears, Frances exclaimed, as if by a sudden
      inspiration: &ldquo;Dear me! I have just thought of it. There is perhaps a
      way of getting these dear children from the convent without violence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, mother?&rdquo; said Agricola, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Abbe Dubois, who had them conveyed thither; but Gabriel
      supposes, that he probably acted by the advice of M. Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if that were so, mother, it would be in vain to apply to M.
      Rodin. We should get nothing from him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from him&mdash;but perhaps from that powerful abbe, who is
      Gabriel&rsquo;s superior, and has always patronized him since his first
      entrance at the seminary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What abbe, mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True mother; before being a priest, he was a soldier he may be more
      accessible than others&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Aigrigny!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, with an expression of hate
      and horror. &ldquo;There is then mixed up with these treasons, a man who
      was a soldier before being a priest, and whose name is D&rsquo;Aigrigny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny&mdash;before the
      Restoration, in the service of Russia&mdash;but, in 1815, the Bourbons
      gave him a regiment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a hollow voice. &ldquo;Always
      the same! like an evil spirit&mdash;to the mother, father, children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny!&rdquo; replied Dagobert. &ldquo;Do
      you know what is this man? Before he was a priest, he was the murderer of
      Rose and Blanche&rsquo;s mother, because she despised his love. Before he
      was a priest, he fought against his country, and twice met General Simon
      face to face in war. Yes; while the general was prisoner at Leipsic,
      covered with wounds at Waterloo, the turncoat marquis triumphed with the
      Russians and English!&mdash;Under the Bourbons, this same renegade, loaded
      with honors, found himself once more face to face with the persecuted
      soldier of the empire. Between them, this time, there was a mortal duel&mdash;the
      marquis was wounded&mdash;General Simon was proscribed, condemned, driven
      into exile. The renegade, you say, has become a priest. Well! I am now
      certain, that it is he who has carried off Rose and Blanche, in order to
      wreak on them his hatred of their father and mother. It is the infamous D&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      who holds them in his power. It is no longer the fortune of these children
      that I have to defend; it is their life&mdash;do you hear what I say?&mdash;their
      very life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, father! do you think this man capable&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A traitor to his country, who finishes by becoming a mock priest,
      is capable of anything. I tell you, that, perhaps at this moment he may be
      killing those children by a slow-fire!&rdquo; exclaimed the soldier, in a
      voice of agony. &ldquo;To separate them from one another was to begin to
      kill them. Yes!&rdquo; added Dagobert, with an exasperation impossible to
      describe; &ldquo;the daughters of Marshal Simon are in the power of the
      Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny and his band, and I hesitate to attempt their
      rescue, for fear of the galleys! The galleys!&rdquo; added he, with a
      convulsive burst of laughter; &ldquo;what do I care for the galleys? Can
      they send a corpse there? If this last attempt fail, shall I not have the
      right to blow my brains out?&mdash;Put the iron in the fire, my boy&mdash;quick!
      time presses&mdash;and strike while the iron&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your son goes with you!&rdquo; exclaimed Frances, with a cry of
      maternal despair. Then rising, she threw herself at the feet of Dagobert,
      and said: &ldquo;If you are arrested, he will be arrested also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To escape the galleys, he will do as I do. I have two pistols.&rdquo;

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And without you&mdash;without him,&rdquo; cried the unhappy mother,
      extending her hands in supplication, &ldquo;what will become of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right&mdash;I was too selfish,&rdquo; said Dagobert.
      &ldquo;I will go alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go alone, father,&rdquo; replied Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch sees what is passing; she will go to Mr. Hardy, my
      master, and tell him all. He is the most generous of men, and my mother
      will have food and shelter for the rest of her days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am the cause of all!&rdquo; cried Frances, wringing her hands
      in despair. &ldquo;Punish me, oh, heaven! for it is my fault. I gave up
      those children. I shall be punished by the death of my child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola, you shall not go with me&mdash;I forbid it!&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, clasping his son closely to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when I have pointed out the danger, am I to be the first to
      shrink from it? you cannot think thus lowly of me, father! Have I not also
      some one to deliver? The good, the generous Mdlle. de Cardoville, who
      tried to save me from a prison, is a captive in her turn. I will follow
      you, father. It is my right, my duty, my determination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Agricola put into the heated stove the tongs that were intended
      to form the hook. &ldquo;Alas! may heaven have pity upon us!&rdquo; cried
      his poor mother, sobbing as she still knelt, whilst the soldier seemed a
      prey to the most violent internal struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not cry so, dear mother; you will break my heart,&rdquo; said
      Agricola, as he raised her with the sempstress&rsquo;s help. &ldquo;Be
      comforted! I have exaggerated the danger of my father. By acting
      prudently, we two may succeed in our enterprise; without much risk&mdash;eh,
      father?&rdquo; added he, with a significant glance at Dagobert. &ldquo;Once
      more, be comforted, dear mother. I will answer for everything. We will
      deliver Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters, and Mdlle. de Cardoville too.
      Sister, give me the hammer and pincers, there in the press.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sempstress, drying her tears, did as desired, while Agricola, by the
      help of bellows, revived the fire in which the tongs were heating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your tools, Agricola,&rdquo; said the hunchback, in a
      deeply-agitated voice, as she presented them with trembling hands to the
      smith, who, with the aid of the pincers, soon drew from the fire the
      white-hot tongs, and, with vigorous blows of the hammer, formed them into
      a hook, taking the stove for his anvil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert had remained silent and pensive. Suddenly he said to Frances,
      taking her by the hand: &ldquo;You know what metal your son is. To prevent
      his following me would now be impossible. But do not be afraid, dear wife;
      we shall succeed&mdash;at least, I hope so. And if we should not succeed&mdash;if
      Agricola and me should be arrested&mdash;well! we are not cowards; we
      shall not commit suicide; but father and son will go arm in arm to prison,
      with heads high and proud, look like two brave men who have done their
      duty. The day of trial must come, and we will explain all, honestly,
      openly&mdash;we will say, that, driven to the last extremity, finding no
      support, no protection in the law, we were forced to have recourse to
      violence. So hammer away, my boy!&rdquo; added Dagobert, addressing his
      son, pounding the hot iron; &ldquo;forge, forge, without fear. Honest
      judges will absolve honest men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, you are right, be at ease dear mother! The judges will
      see the difference between rascals who scale walls in order to rob, and an
      old soldier and his son who, at peril of their liberty, their life, their
      honor, have sought only to deliver unhappy victims.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if this language should not be heard,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert,
      &ldquo;so much the worse for them! It will not be your son, or husband,
      who will be dishonored in the eyes of honest people. If they send us to
      the galleys, and we have courage to survive&mdash;the young and the old
      convict will wear their chains proudly&mdash;and the renegade marquis, the
      traitor priest, will bear more shame than we. So, forge without fear, my
      boy! There are things which the galleys themselves cannot disgrace&mdash;our
      good conscience and our honor! But now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;two words
      with my good Mother Bunch. It grows late, and time presses. On entering
      the garden, did you remark if the windows of the convent were far from the
      ground?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very far, M. Dagobert&mdash;particularly on that side which
      is opposite to the madhouse, where Mdlle. de Cardoville is confined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you manage to speak to that young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was on the other side of an open paling, which separates the
      two gardens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; said Agricola, as he continued to hammer the
      iron: &ldquo;we can easily pass from one garden to the other. The madhouse
      may perhaps be the readier way out. Unfortunately, you do not know, Mdlle.
      de Cardoville&rsquo;s chamber.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; returned the work-girl, recollecting herself.
      &ldquo;She is lodged in one of the wings, and there is a shade over her
      window, painted like canvas, with blue and white stripes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I shall not forget that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you form no guess as to where are the rooms of my poor
      children?&rdquo; said Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Mother Bunch answered, &ldquo;They are
      opposite to the chamber occupied by Mdlle. de Cardoville, for she makes
      signs to them from her window: and I now remember she told me, that their
      two rooms are on different stories, one on the ground-floor, and the other
      up one pair of stairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these windows grated?&rdquo; asked the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, my good girl: with these indications we shall do very
      well,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;For the rest, I have my plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some water, my little sister,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;that I
      may cool my iron.&rdquo; Then addressing his father: &ldquo;Will this hook
      do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy; as soon as it is cold we will fasten the cord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time, Frances Baudoin had remained upon her knees, praying with
      fervor. She implored Heaven to have pity on Agricola and Dagobert, who, in
      their ignorance, were about to commit a great crime; and she entreated
      that the celestial vengeance might fall upon her only, as she alone had
      been the cause of the fatal resolution of her son and husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert and Agricola finished their preparations in silence. They were
      both very pale, and solemnly grave. They felt all the danger of so
      desperate an enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock at Saint-Mery&rsquo;s struck ten. The sound of the bell was
      faint, and almost drowned by the lashing of the wind and rain, which had
      not ceased for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with a start. &ldquo;There
      is not a minute to lose. Take the sack, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went to fetch the sack, Agricola approached Mother Bunch, who was
      hardly able to sustain herself, and said to her in a rapid whisper:
      &ldquo;If we are not here to-morrow, take care of my mother. Go to M.
      Hardy, who will perhaps have returned from his journey. Courage, my
      sister! embrace me. I leave poor mother to you.&rdquo; The smith, deeply
      affected, pressed the almost fainting girl in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, old Spoil-sport,&rdquo; said Dagobert: &ldquo;you shall be
      our scout.&rdquo; Approaching his wife, who, just risen from the ground,
      was clasping her son&rsquo;s head to her bosom, and covering it with tears
      and kisses, he said to her, with a semblance of calmness and serenity:
      &ldquo;Come, my dear wife, be reasonable! Make us a good fire. In two or
      three hours we will bring home the two poor children, and a fine young
      lady. Kiss me! that will bring me luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances threw herself on her husband&rsquo;s neck, without uttering a
      word. This mute despair, mingled with convulsive sobs, was heart-rending.
      Dagobert was obliged to tear himself from his wife&rsquo;s arms, and
      striving to conceal his emotion, he said to his son, in an agitated voice:
      &ldquo;Let us go&mdash;she unmans me. Take care of her, my good Mother
      Bunch. Agricola&mdash;come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier slipped the pistols into the pocket of his great coat, and
      rushed towards the door, followed by Spoil-sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, let me embrace you once more&mdash;alas! it is perhaps for
      the last time!&rdquo; cried the unfortunate mother, incapable of rising,
      but stretching out her arms to Agricola. &ldquo;Forgive me! it is all my
      fault.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The smith turned back, mingled his tears with those of his mother&mdash;for
      he also wept&mdash;and murmured, in a stifled voice: &ldquo;Adieu, dear
      mother! Be comforted. We shall soon meet again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, escaping from the embrace, he joined his father upon the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frances Baudoin heaved a long sigh, and fell almost lifeless into the
      needlewoman&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert and Agricola left the Rue Brise-Miche in the height of the storm,
      and hastened with great strides towards the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hopital,
      followed by the dog.

      CHAPTER XIII. BURGLARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>alf-past eleven
      had just struck, when Dagobert and his son arrived on the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hopital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew violently, and the rain fell down in torrents, but
      notwithstanding the thickness of the watery clouds, it was tolerably
      light, thanks to the late rising of the moon. The tall, dark trees, and
      the white walls of the convent garden, were distinguishable in the midst
      of the pale glimmer. Afar off, a street lamp, acted on by the wind, with
      its red lights hardly visible through the mist and rain, swung backwards
      and forwards over the dirty causeway of the solitary boulevard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At rare intervals, they heard, at a very great distance, the rattle and
      rumble of a coach, returning home late; then all was again silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since their departure from the Rue Brise-Miche, Dagobert and his son had
      hardly exchanged a word. The design of these two brave men was noble and
      generous, and yet, resolute but pensive, they glided through the darkness
      like bandits, at the hour of nocturnal crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola carried on his shoulders the sack containing the cord, the hook,
      and the iron bar; Dagobert leaned upon the arm of his son, and Spoil sport
      followed his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bench, where we sat down, must be close by,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Agricola, looking around; &ldquo;here it is,
      father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is oily half-past eleven&mdash;we must wait for midnight,&rdquo;
      resumed Dagobert. &ldquo;Let us be seated for an instant, to rest
      ourselves, and decide upon our plan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, the soldier took his son&rsquo;s hands
      between his own, and thus continued: &ldquo;Agricola, my child&mdash;it is
      yet time. Let me go alone, I entreat you. I shall know very well how to
      get through the business; but the nearer the moment comes, the more I fear
      to drag you into this dangerous enterprise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the nearer the moment comes, father, the more I feel I may be
      of some use; but, be it good or bad, I will share the fortune of your
      adventure. Our object is praiseworthy; it is a debt of honor that you have
      to pay, and I will take one half of it. Do not fancy that I will now draw
      back. And so, dear father, let us think of our plan of action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will come?&rdquo; said Dagobert, stifling a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must do everything,&rdquo; proceeded Agricola, &ldquo;to secure
      success. You have already noticed the little garden-door, near the angle
      of the wall&mdash;that is excellent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall get by that way into the garden, and look immediately for
      the open paling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for on one side of this paling is the wing inhabited by Mdlle.
      de Cardoville, and on the other that part of the convent in which the
      general&rsquo;s daughters are confined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Spoil-sport, who was crouching at Dagobert&rsquo;s feet,
      rose suddenly, and pricked up his ears, as if to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think that Spoil-sport heard something,&rdquo; said
      Agricola. They listened&mdash;but heard only the wind, sounding through
      the tall trees of the boulevard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think of it, father&mdash;when the garden-door is once open,
      shall we take Spoil-sport with us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for if there is a watch-dog, he will settle him. And then he
      will give us notice of the approach of those who go the rounds. Besides,
      he is so intelligent, so attached to Rose and Blanche, that (who knows?)
      he may help to discover the place where they are. Twenty times I have seen
      him find them in the woods, by the most extraordinary instinct.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow and solemn knell here rose above the noise of the wind: it was the
      first stroke of twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      That note seemed to echo mournfully through the souls of Agricola and his
      father. Mute with emotion, they shuddered, and by a spontaneous movement,
      each grasped the hand of the other. In spite of themselves, their hearts
      kept time to every stroke of the clock, as each successive vibration was
      prolonged through the gloomy silence of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last strobe, Dagobert said to his son, in a firm voice: &ldquo;It
      is midnight. Shake hands, and let us forward!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment was decisive and solemn. &ldquo;Now, father,&rdquo; said
      Agricola, &ldquo;we will act with as much craft and daring as thieves
      going to pillage a strong box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the smith took from the sack the cord and hook; Dagobert armed
      himself with the iron bar, and both advanced cautiously, following the
      wall in the direction of the little door, situated not far from the angle
      formed by the street and the boulevard. They stopped from time to time, to
      listen attentively, trying to distinguish those noises which were not
      caused either by the high wind or the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It continued light enough for them to be able to see surrounding objects,
      and the smith and the soldier soon gained the little door, which appeared
      much decayed, and not very strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Agricola to his father. &ldquo;It will yield at
      one blow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The smith was about to apply his shoulder vigorously to the door, when
      Spoil-sport growled hoarsely, and made a &ldquo;point.&rdquo; Dagobert
      silenced the dog with a word, and grasping his son&rsquo;s arm, said to
      him in a whisper: &ldquo;Do not stir. The dog has scented some one in the
      garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola and his father remained for some minutes motionless, holding
      their breath and listening. The dog, in obedience to his master, no longer
      growled, but his uneasiness and agitation were displayed more and more.
      Yet they heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dog must have been deceived, father,&rdquo; whispered Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of the contrary. Do not move.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After some seconds of expectation, Spoil-sport crouched down abruptly, and
      pushed his nose as far as possible under the door, snuffling up the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming,&rdquo; said Dagobert hastily, to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us draw off a little distance,&rdquo; replied Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;we must listen. It will be time
      to retire, if they open the door. Here, Spoil-sport! down!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog obeyed, and withdrawing from the door, crouched down at the feet
      of his master. Some seconds after, they heard a sort of splashing on the
      damp ground, caused by heavy footsteps in puddles of water, and then the
      sound of words, which carried away by the wind, did not reach distinctly
      the ears of the soldier and the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the people of whom Mother Bunch told us, going their
      round,&rdquo; said Agricola to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. There will be an interval before they come
      round again, and we shall have some two hours before us, without
      interruption. Our affair is all right now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, the sound of the footsteps became less and less distinct, and
      at last died away altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, quick! we must not lose any time,&rdquo; said Dagobert to his
      son, after waiting about ten minutes; &ldquo;they are far enough. Let us
      try to open the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola leaned his powerful shoulder against it, and pushed vigorously;
      but the door did not give way, notwithstanding its age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;there is a bar on the
      inside. I am sure of it, or these old planks would not have resisted my
      weight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20141.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will scale the wall by means of the cord and hook, and open the
      door from the other side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Agricola took the cord, and after several attempts, succeeded
      in fixing the hook on the coping of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, father, give me a leg up; I will help myself up with the cord;
      once astride on the wall, I can easily turn the hook and get down into the
      garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier leaned against the wall, and joined his two hands, in the
      hollow of which his son placed one of his feet, then mounting upon the
      robust shoulders of his father, he was able, by help of the cord, and some
      irregularities in the wall, to reach the top. Unfortunately, the smith had
      not perceived that the coping of the wall was strewed with broken bottles,
      so that he wounded his knees and hands; but, for fear of alarming
      Dagobert, he repressed every exclamation of pain, and replacing the hook,
      he glided down the cord to the ground. The door was close by, and he
      hastened to it; a strong wooden bar had indeed secured it on the inside.
      This was removed, and the lock was in so bad a state, that it offered no
      resistance to a violent effort from Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and Dagobert entered the garden with Spoil-sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the soldier to his son, &ldquo;thanks to you, the
      worst is over. Here is a means of escape for the poor children, and Mdlle.
      de Cardoville. The thing is now to find them, without accident or delay.
      Spoil-sport will go before as a scout. Come, my good dog!&rdquo; added
      Dagobert, &ldquo;above all&mdash;fair and softly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, the intelligent animal advanced a few steps, sniffing and
      listening with the care and caution of a hound searching for the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the half-light of the clouded moon, Dagobert and his son perceived
      round them a V-shaped grove of tall trees, at which several paths met.
      Uncertain which to choose, Agricola said to his father: &ldquo;Let us take
      the path that runs alongside the wall. It will surely lead to some
      building.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! Let us walk on the strips of grass, instead of through the
      mud. It will make less noise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The father and son, preceded by the Siberian dog, kept for some time in a
      winding path, at no great distance from the wall. They stopped now and
      then to listen, or to satisfy themselves, before continuing their advance,
      with regard to the changing aspects of the trees and bushes, which, shaken
      by the wind, and faintly illumined by the pale light of the moon, often
      took strange and doubtful forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past twelve struck as Agricola and his father reached a large iron
      gate which shut in that part of the garden reserved for the Superior&mdash;the
      same into which Mother Bunch had intruded herself, after seeing Rose Simon
      converse with Adrienne de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the bars of this gate, Agricola and his father perceived at a
      little distance an open paling, which joined a half-finished chapel, and
      beyond it a little square building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no doubt the building occupied by Mdlle. de Cardoville,&rdquo;
      said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the building which contains the chambers of Rose and Blanche,
      but which we cannot see from here, is no doubt opposite it,&rdquo; said
      Dagobert. &ldquo;Poor children! they are there, weeping tears of despair,&rdquo;
      added he, with profound emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided the gate be but open,&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will probably be so&mdash;being within the walls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on gently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate was only fastened by the catch of the lock. Dagobert was about to
      open it, when Agricola said to him: &ldquo;Take care! do not make it creak
      on its hinges.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I push it slowly or suddenly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me manage it,&rdquo; said Agricola; and he opened the gate so
      quickly, that it creaked very little; still the noise might have been
      plainly heard, in the silence of the night, during one of the lulls
      between the squalls of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola and his father remained motionless for a moment, listening
      uneasily, before they ventured to pass through the gate. Nothing stirred,
      however; all remained calm and still. With fresh courage, they entered the
      reserved garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the dog arrived on this spot, when he exhibited tokens of
      extraordinary delight. Picking up his ears, wagging his tail, bounding
      rather than running, he had soon reached the paling where, in the morning,
      Rose Simon had for a moment conversed with Mdlle. de Cardoville. He
      stopped an instant at this place, as if at fault, and turned round and
      round like a dog seeking the scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert and his son, leaving Spoil-sport to his instinct, followed his
      least movements with intense interest, hoping everything from his
      intelligence and his attachment to the orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no doubt near this paling that Rose stood when Mother Bunch
      saw her,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;Spoil-sport is on her track. Let him
      alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few seconds, the dog turned his head towards Dagobert, and started
      at full trot in the direction of a door on the ground-floor of a building,
      opposite to that occupied by Adrienne. Arrived at this door, the dog lay
      down, seemingly waiting for Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it! the children are there!&rdquo; said Dagobert,
      hastening to rejoin Spoil-sport; &ldquo;it was by this door that they took
      Rose into the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must see if the windows are grated,&rdquo; said Agricola,
      following his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old fellow!&rdquo; whispered the soldier, as he came up to
      the dog and pointed to the building, &ldquo;are Rose and Blanche there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog lifted his head, and answered by a joyful bark. Dagobert had just
      time to seize the mouth of the animal with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will ruin all!&rdquo; exclaimed the smith. &ldquo;They have,
      perhaps, heard him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;But there is no longer any doubt&mdash;the
      children are here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, the iron gate, by which the soldier and his son had
      entered the reserved garden, and which they had left open, fell to with a
      loud noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shut us in,&rdquo; said Agricola, hastily; &ldquo;and
      there is no other issue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, the father and son looked in dismay at each other; but
      Agricola instantly resumed: &ldquo;The gate has perhaps shut of itself. I
      will make haste to assure myself of this, and to open it again if
      possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quickly; I will examine the windows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola flew towards the gate, whilst Dagobert, gliding along the wall,
      soon reached the windows on the ground floor. They were four in number,
      and two of them were not grated. He looked up at the first story; it was
      not very far from the ground, and none of the windows had bars. It would
      then be easy for that one of the two sisters, who inhabited this story,
      once informed of their presence, to let herself down by means of a sheet,
      as the orphans had already done to escape from the inn of the White
      Falcon. But the difficult thing was to know which room she occupied.
      Dagobert thought they might learn this from the sister on the ground
      floor; but then there was another difficulty&mdash;at which of the four
      windows should they knock?
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola returned precipitately. &ldquo;It was the wind, no doubt, which
      shut the gate,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have opened it again, and made it
      fast with a stone. But we have no time to lose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how shall we know the windows of the poor children?&rdquo; said
      Dagobert, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Agricola, with uneasiness. &ldquo;What is
      to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To call them at hap-hazard,&rdquo; continued Dagobert, &ldquo;would
      be to give the alarm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; cried Agricola, with increasing anguish.
      &ldquo;To have arrived here, under their windows, and yet not to know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time presses,&rdquo; said Dagobert, hastily, interrupting his son;
      &ldquo;we must run all risks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call out loud, &lsquo;Rose and Blanche&rsquo;&mdash;in their
      state of despair, I am sure they do not sleep. They will be stirring at my
      first summons. By means of a sheet, fastened to the window, she who is on
      the first story will in five minutes be in our arms. As for the one on the
      ground floor&mdash;if her window is not grated, we can have her in a
      second. If it is, we shall soon loosen one of the bars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father&mdash;this calling out aloud?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not perhaps be heard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it is heard&mdash;all will be lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? Before they have time to call the watch, and open
      several doors, the children may be delivered. Once at the entrance of the
      boulevard, and we shall be safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a dangerous course; but I see no other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there are only two men, I and Spoil-sport will keep them in
      check, while you will have time to carry off the children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, there is a better way&mdash;a surer one,&rdquo; cried
      Agricola, suddenly. &ldquo;From what Mother Bunch told us, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville has corresponded by signs with Rose and Blanche.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence she knows where they are lodged, as the poor children
      answered her from their windows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. There is only that course to take. But how find her
      room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch told me there was a shade over the window.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! we have only to break through a wooden fence. Have you the
      iron bar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, quick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few steps, Dagobert and his son had reached the paling. Three planks,
      torn away by Agricola, opened an easy passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain here, father, and keep watch,&rdquo; said he to Dagobert, as
      he entered Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indicated window was easily recognized. It was high and broad; a sort
      of shade surmounted it, for this window had once been a door, since walled
      in to the third of its height. It was protected by bars of iron, pretty
      far apart. Since some minutes, the rain had ceased. The moon, breaking
      through the clouds, shone full upon the building. Agricola, approaching
      the window, saw that the room was perfectly dark; but light came from a
      room beyond, through a door left half open. The smith, hoping that Mdlle.
      de Cardoville might be still awake, tapped lightly at the window. Soon
      after, the door in the background opened entirely, and Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, who had not yet gone to bed, came from the other chamber,
      dressed as she had been at her interview with Mother Bunch. Her charming
      features were visible by the light of the taper she held in her hand.
      Their present expression was that of surprise and anxiety. The young girl
      set down the candlestick on the table, and appeared to listen attentively
      as she approached the window. Suddenly she started and stopped abruptly.
      She had just discerned the face of a man, looking at her through the
      window. Agricola, fearing that Mdlle. de Cardoville would retire in terror
      to the next room, again tapped on the glass, and running the risk of being
      heard by others, said in a pretty loud voice: &ldquo;It is Agricola
      Baudoin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words reached the ears of Adrienne. Instantly remembering her
      interview with Mother Bunch, she thought that Agricola and Dagobert must
      have entered the convent for the purpose of carrying off Rose and Blanche.
      She ran to the window, recognized Agricola in the clear moonlight, and
      cautiously opened the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the smith, hastily; &ldquo;there is not an
      instant to lose. The Count de Montbron is not in Paris. My father and
      myself have come to deliver you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, thanks, M. Agricola!&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, in a
      tone expressive of the most touching gratitude; &ldquo;but think first of
      the daughters of General Simon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do think of them, madame, I have come to ask you which are their
      windows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is on the ground floor, the last on the garden-side; the other
      is exactly over it, on the first story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are saved!&rdquo; cried the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let me see!&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, hastily; &ldquo;the first
      story is pretty high. You will find, near the chapel they are building,
      some long poles belonging to the scaffolding. They may be of use to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be as good as a ladder, to reach the upstairs window. But
      now to think of you madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think only of the dear orphans. Time presses. Provided they are
      delivered to-night, it makes little difference to me to remain a day or
      two longer in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried the smith, &ldquo;it is of the first
      importance that you should leave this place to-night. Interests are
      concerned, of which you know nothing. I am now sure of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not time to explain myself further; but I conjure you
      madame, to come. I can wrench out two of these bars; I will fetch a piece
      of iron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary. They are satisfied with locking the outer door
      of this building, which I inhabit alone. You can easily break open the
      lock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in ten minutes, we shall be on the boulevard,&rdquo; said the
      smith. &ldquo;Make yourself ready, madame; take a shawl, a bonnet, for the
      night is cold. I will return instantly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Agricola,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with tears in her eyes, &ldquo;I
      know what you risk for my sake. I shall prove to you, I hope, that I have
      as good a memory as you have. You and your adopted sister are noble and
      valiant creatures, and I am proud to be indebted to you. But do not return
      for me till the daughters of Marshal Simon are in safety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to your directions, the thing will be done directly, madame.
      I fly to rejoin my father, and we will come together to fetch you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the excellent advice of Mdlle. de Cardoville, Agricola took one
      of the long, strong poles that rested against the wall of the chapel, and,
      bearing it on his robust shoulders, hastened to rejoin his father. Hardly
      had Agricola passed the fence, to direct his steps towards the chapel,
      obscured in shadow, than Mdlle. de Cardoville thought she perceived a
      human form issue from one of the clumps of trees in the convent-garden,
      cross the path hastily, and disappear behind a high hedge of box. Alarmed
      at the sight, Adrienne in vain called to Agricola in a low voice, to bid
      him beware. He could not hear her; he had already rejoined his father,
      who, devoured by impatience, went from window to window with
      ever-increasing anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are saved,&rdquo; whispered Agricola. &ldquo;Those are the
      windows of the poor children&mdash;one on the ground floor, the other on
      the first story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with a burst of joy impossible to
      describe. He ran to examine the windows. &ldquo;They are not grated!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make sure, that one of them is there,&rdquo; said Agricola;
      &ldquo;then, by placing this pole against the wall, I will climb up to the
      first story, which is not so very high.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, my boy!&mdash;once there, tap at the window, and call Rose
      or Blanche. When she answers, come down. We will rest the pole against the
      window, and the poor child will slide along it. They are bold and active.
      Quick, quick! to work!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then we will deliver Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Agricola placed his pole against the wall, and prepares to mount,
      Dagobert tapped at the panes of the last window on the ground floor, and
      said aloud: &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Simon indeed occupied the chamber. The unhappy child, in despair at
      being separated from her sister, was a prey to a burning fever, and,
      unable to sleep, watered her pillow with her tears. At the sound of the
      tapping on the glass, she started up affrighted, then, hearing the voice
      of the soldier&mdash;that voice so familiar and so dear&mdash;she sat up
      in bed, pressed her hands across her forehead, to assure herself that she
      was not the plaything of a dream, and, wrapped in her long night-dress,
      ran to the window with a cry of joy. But suddenly&mdash;and before she
      could open the casement&mdash;two reports of fire-arms were heard,
      accompanied by loud cries of &ldquo;Help! thieves!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphan stood petrified with terror, her eyes mechanically fixed upon
      the window, through which she saw confusedly, by the light of the moon,
      several men engaged in a mortal struggle, whilst the furious barking of
      Spoil-sport was heard above all the incessant cries of &ldquo;Help! Help!
      Thieves! Murder!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV. THE EVE OF A GREAT DAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout two hours
      before the event last related took place at St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent,
      Rodin and Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny met in the room where we have already seen
      them, in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins. Since the Revolution of July,
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had thought proper to remove for the moment to
      this temporary habitation all the secret archives and correspondence of
      his Order&mdash;a prudent measure, since he had every reason to fear that
      the reverend fathers would be expelled by the state from that magnificent
      establishment, with which the restoration had so liberally endowed their
      society. (11)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, dressed in his usual sordid style, mean and dirty as ever, was
      writing modestly at his desk, faithful to his humble part of secretary,
      which concealed, as we have already seen a far more important office&mdash;that
      of Socius&mdash;a function which, according to the constitutions of the
      Order, consists in never quitting his superior, watching his least
      actions, spying into his very thoughts, and reporting all to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his usual impassibility, Rodin appeared visibly uneasy and
      absent in mind; he answered even more briefly than usual to the commands
      and questions of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who had but just entered the
      room.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20151.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything new occurred during my absence?&rdquo; asked he.
      &ldquo;Are the reports still favorable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very favorable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read them to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before giving this account to your reverence,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      &ldquo;I must inform you that Morok has been two days in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morok?&rdquo; said Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with surprise. &ldquo;I
      thought, on leaving Germany and Switzerland, he had received from Friburg
      the order to proceed southward. At Nismes, or Avignon, he would at this
      moment be useful as an agent; for the Protestants begin to move, and we
      fear a reaction against the Catholics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;if Morok may not have had
      private reasons for changing his route. His ostensible reasons are, that
      he comes here to give performances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dramatic agent, passing through Lyons, engaged him and his
      menagerie for the Port Saint-Martin Theatre at a very high price. He says
      that he did not like to refuse such an offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, shrugging his shoulders,
      &ldquo;but by distributing his little books, and selling prints and
      chaplets, as well as by the influence he would certainly exercise over the
      pious and ignorant people of the South or of Brittany, he might render
      services, such as he can never perform in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is now below, with a kind of giant, who travels about with him.
      In his capacity of your reverence&rsquo;s old servant, Morok hoped to have
      the honor of kissing your hand this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible&mdash;impossible&mdash;you know how much I am occupied.
      Have you sent to the Rue Saint-Francois?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have. The old Jew guardian has had notice from the notary.
      To morrow, at six in the morning, the masons will unwall the door, and,
      for the first time since one hundred and fifty years, the house will be
      opened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny remained in thought for a moment, and then said to
      Rodin: &ldquo;On the eve of such a decisive day, we must neglect nothing,
      and call every circumstance to memory. Read me the copy of the note,
      inserted in the archives of the society, a century and a half ago, on the
      subject of Rennepont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary took the note from the case, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This 19th day of February, 1682, the Reverend
      Father-Provincial Alexander Bourdon sent the following advice, with these
      words in the margin: Of extreme importance for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We have just discovered, by the confession of a dying person
      to one of our fathers, a very close secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Marius de Rennepont, one of the most active and redoubtable
      partisans of the Reformed Religion, and one of the most determined enemies
      of our Holy Society, had apparently re-entered the pale of our Mother
      Church, but with the sole design of saving his worldly goods, threatened
      with confiscation because of his irreligious and damnable errors. Evidence
      having been furnished by different persons of our company to prove that
      the conversion of Rennepont was not sincere, and in reality covered a
      sacrilegious lure, the possessions of the said gentleman, now considered a
      relapsed heretic, were confiscated by our gracious sovereign, his Majesty
      King Louis XIV, and the said Rennepont was condemned to the galleys for
      life.(12) He escaped his doom by a voluntary death; in consequence of
      which abominable crime, his body was dragged upon a hurdle, and flung to
      the dogs on the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;From these preliminaries, we come to the great secret, which
      is of such importance to the future interests of our Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;His Majesty Louis XIV., in his paternal and Catholic
      goodness towards the Church in general, and our Order in particular, had
      granted to us the profit of this confiscation, in acknowledgment of our
      services in discovering the infamous and sacrilegious relapse of the said
      Rennepont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But we have just learned, for certain, that a house situated
      in Paris, No. 3, Rue Saint-Francois, and a sum of fifty thousand gold
      crowns, have escaped this confiscation, and have consequently been stolen
      from our Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The house was conveyed, before the confiscation, by means of
      a feigned purchase, to a friend of Rennepont&rsquo;s a good Catholic,
      unfortunately, as against him we cannot take any severe measures. Thanks
      to the culpable, but secure connivance of his friend, the house has been
      walled up, and is only to be opened in a century and a half, according to
      the last will of Rennepont. As for the fifty thousand gold crowns, they
      have been placed in hands which, unfortunately, are hitherto unknown to
      us, in order to be invested and put out to use for one hundred and fifty
      years, at the expiration of which time they are to be divided between the
      then existing descendants of the said Rennepont; and it is calculated that
      this sum, increased by so many accumulations, will by then have become
      enormous, and will amount to at least forty or fifty millions of livres
      tournois. From motives which are not known, but which are duly stated in a
      testamentary document, the said Rennepont has concealed from his family,
      whom the edicts against the Protestants have driven out of France, the
      investment of these fifty thousand crowns; and has only desired his
      relations to preserve in their line from generation to generation, the
      charge to the last survivors, to meet in Paris, Rue Saint-Francois, a
      hundred and fifty years hence, on February the 13th, 1832. And that this
      charge might not be forgotten, he employed a person, whose description is
      known, but not his real occupation, to cause to be manufactured sundry
      bronze medals, on which the request and date are engraved, and to deliver
      one to each member of the family&mdash;a measure the more necessary, as,
      from some other motive equally unknown, but probably explained in the
      testament, the heirs are to present themselves on the day in question,
      before noon, in person, and not by any attorney, or representative, or to
      forfeit all claim to the inheritance. The stranger who undertook to
      distribute the medals to the different members of the family of Rennepont
      is a man of thirty to thirty-six years of age, of tall stature, and with a
      proud and sad expression of countenance. He has black eyebrows, very
      thick, and singularly joined together. He is known as JOSEPH, and is much
      suspected of being an active and dangerous emissary of the wretched
      republicans and heretics of the Seven United Provinces. It results from
      these premises, that this sum, surreptitiously confided by a relapsed
      heretic to unknown hands, has escaped the confiscation decreed in our
      favor by our well-beloved king. A serious fraud and injury has therefore
      been committed, and we are bound to take every means to recover this our
      right, if not immediately, at least in some future time. Our Society being
      (for the greater glory of God and our Holy Father) imperishable, it will
      be easy, thanks to the connections we keep up with all parts of the world,
      by means of missions and other establishments, to follow the line of this
      family of Rennepont from generation to generation, without ever losing
      sight of it&mdash;so that a hundred and fifty years hence, at the moment
      of the division of this immense accumulation of property, our Company may
      claim the inheritance of which it has been so treacherously deprived, and
      recover it by any means in its power, fas aut nefas, even by craft or
      violence&mdash;our Company not being bound to act tenderly with the future
      detainers of our goods, of which we have been maliciously deprived by an
      infamous and sacrilegious heretic&mdash;and because it is right to defend,
      preserve, and recover one&rsquo;s own property by every means which the
      Lord may place within one&rsquo;s reach. Until, therefore, the complete
      restitution of this wealth, the family of Rennepont must be considered as
      reprobate and damnable, as the cursed seed of a Cain, and always to be
      watched with the utmost caution. And it is to be recommended, that, every
      year from this present date, a sort of inquisition should be held as to
      the situation of the successive members of this family.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin paused, and said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: &ldquo;Here follows the
      account, year by year, of the history of this family, from the year 1682,
      to our own day. It will be useless to read this to your reverence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite useless,&rdquo; said Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;The note
      contains all the important facts.&rdquo; Then, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, he exclaimed, with an expression of triumphant pride: &ldquo;How
      great is the power of the Association, when founded upon tradition and
      perpetuity! Thanks to this note, inserted in our archives a century and a
      half ago, this family has been watched from generation to generation&mdash;our
      Order has always had its eyes upon them, following them to all points of
      the globe, to which exile had distributed them&mdash;and at last,
      to-morrow, we shall obtain possession of this property, at first
      inconsiderable, but which a hundred and fifty years have raised to a royal
      fortune. Yes, we shall succeed, for we have foreseen every eventuality.
      One thing only troubles me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The information that we have in vain tried to obtain from the
      guardian of the house in the Rue Saint-Francois. Has the attempt been once
      more made, as I directed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time, as always before, the old Jew has remained impenetrable.
      Besides he is almost in his second childhood, and his wife not much
      better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;that
      for a century and a half, this house in the Rue Saint-Francois has
      remained walled up, and that the care of it has been transmitted from
      generation to generation in this family of the Samuels&mdash;I cannot
      suppose that they have all been ignorant as to who were and are the
      successive holders of these funds, now become immense by accumulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;by the notes upon this
      affair, that the Order has always carefully followed it up ever since
      1682. At different periods attempts have been made to obtain information
      upon subjects not fully explained in the note of Father Bourdon. But this
      race of Jew guardians has ever remained dumb, and we must therefore
      conclude that they know nothing about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has always struck me as impossible; for the ancestor of these
      Samuels was present at the closing of the house, a hundred and fifty years
      ago. He was according to the file, a servant or confidential clerk of De
      Rennepont. It is impossible that he should not have known many things, the
      tradition of which must have been preserved in the family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were allowed to hazard a brief observation,&rdquo; began
      Rodin, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few years ago we obtained certain information through the
      confessional, that the funds were in existence, and that they had risen to
      an enormous amount.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless; and it was that which called the attention of the
      Reverend Father-General so strongly to this affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know, then, what probably the descendants of the family do not&mdash;the
      immense value of this inheritance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;the person who
      certified this fact in confession is worthy of all belief. Only lately,
      the same declaration was renewed; but all the efforts of the confessor
      could not obtain the name of the trustee, or anything beyond the
      assertion, that the money could not be in more honest hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, then,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;that we are
      certain of what is most important.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who knows if the holder of this enormous sum will appear
      to-morrow, in spite of the honesty ascribed to him? The nearer the moment
      the more my anxiety increases. Ah!&rdquo; continued Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;the interests concerned are so
      immense that the consequences of success are quite incalculable. However,
      all that it was possible to do, has been at least tried.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To these words, which Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny addressed to Rodin, as if
      asking for his assent, the socius returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abbe looked at him with surprise, and said: &ldquo;Are you not of my
      opinion&mdash;could more have been attempted? Have we not gone to the
      extreme limit of the possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin bowed respectfully, but remained mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think we have omitted some precaution,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a sort of uneasy impatience, &ldquo;speak out! We have still time.
      Once more, do you think it is possible to do more than I have done? All
      the other descendants being removed, when Gabriel appears to-morrow in the
      Rue Saint-Francois, will he not be the only representative of this family,
      and consequently the rightful possessor of this immense fortune? Now,
      according to his act of renunciation, and the provisions of our statutes,
      it is not to him, but to the Order, that these possessions must fall.
      Could I have acted better, or in any other manner? Speak frankly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot permit myself to offer an opinion on this subject,&rdquo;
      replied Rodin, humbly, and again bowing; &ldquo;the success of the
      measures taken must answer your reverence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny shrugged his shoulders, and reproached himself for
      having asked advice of this writing-machine, that served him for a
      secretary, and to whom he only ascribed three qualities&mdash;memory,
      discretion, and exactness.
    </p>
    <p>
      (11) This was an idle fear, for we read in the Constitutionnel, Feb. 1st
      1832, as follows: &ldquo;When in 1822, M. de Corbiere abruptly abolished
      that splendid Normal School, which, during its few years&rsquo; existence,
      had called forth or developed such a variety of talent, it was decided, as
      some compensation, that a house in the Rue des Postes should be purchased,
      where the congregation of the Holy Ghost should be located and endowed.
      The Minister of Marine supplied the funds for this purpose, and its
      management was placed at the disposal of the Society, which then reigned
      over France. From that period it has held quiet possession of the place,
      which at once became a sort of house of entertainment, where Jesuitism
      sheltered, and provided for, the numerous novitiates that flocked from all
      parts of the country, to receive instructions from Father Ronsin. Matters
      were in this state when the Revolution of July broke out, which threatened
      to deprive the Society of this establishment. But it will hardly be
      believed; this was not done. It is true that they suppressed their
      practice, but they left them in possession of the house in the Rue des
      Postes; and to this very day, the 31st of January, 1832, the members of
      the Sacred Heart are housed at the expense of government, during the whole
      of which time the Normal School has been without a shelter&mdash;and on
      its reorganization, thrust into a dirty hole, in a narrow corner of the
      College of Louis the Great.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The above appeared in the Constitutionnel, respecting the house in the Rue
      des Posses. We are certainly ignorant as to the nature of the
      transactions, since that period, that have taken place between the
      reverend fathers and the government; but we read further, in a recently
      published article that appeared in a journal, in reference to the Society
      of Jesus, that the house in the Rue des Postes, still forms a part of
      their landed property. We will here give some portions of the article in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The following is a list of the property belonging to this branch of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Jesuits:                                       Fr.
     House in the Rue de Postes, worth about 500,000
     One in the Rue de Sevres, estimated at  300,000
     Farm, two leagues from Paris.....150,000
     House and church at Bourges..... 100,000
     Notre Dame de Liesse, donation in 1843   60,000
     Saint Acheul, House for Novitiates..  400,000
     Nantes, a house...........100,000
     Quimper, ditto...........  40,000
     Laval, house and church......  150,000
     Rennes, a house..........  20,000
     Vannes, ditto...........  20,000
     Metz, ditto............  40,000
     Strasbourg............   60,000
     Rouen, ditto...........   15,000
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this it appears that these various items amount to little less
      than two millions. Teaching, moreover, is another important source of
      revenue to the Jesuits. The college at Broyclette alone brings in 200,000
      francs. The two provinces in France (for the general of the Jesuits at
      Rome has divided France into two provinces, Lyons and Paris) possess,
      besides a large sum in ready money, Austrian bonds of more than 260,000
      francs. Their Propagation of Faith furnishes annually some 50,000 francs;
      and the harvest which the priests collect by their sermons amounts to
      150,000 francs. The alms given for charity may be estimated at the same
      figure, producing together a revenue of 540,000 francs. Now, to this
      revenue may be added the produce of the sale of the Society&rsquo;s works,
      and the profit obtained by hawking pictures. Each plate costs, design and
      engraving included, about 600 francs, off which are struck about 10,000
      copies, at 40 francs per thousand, and there is a further expense of 250
      francs to their publisher; and they obtain a net profit of 210 francs on
      every thousand. This, indeed, is working to advantage. And it can easily
      be imagined with what rapidity all these are sold. The fathers themselves
      are the travellers for the Society, and it would be difficult to find more
      zealous or persevering ones. They are always well received, and do not
      know what it is to meet with a refusal. They always take care that the
      publisher should be one of their own body. The first person whom they
      selected for this occupation was one of their members, possessing some
      money; but they were obliged, notwithstanding, to make certain advances to
      enable him to defray the expenses of its first establishment. But, when
      they became fully convinced of the success of their undertaking, they
      suddenly called in these advances, which the publisher was not in a
      condition to pay. They were perfectly aware of this, and superseded him by
      a wealthy successor, with whom they could make a better bargain; and thus,
      without remorse, they ruined the man, by thrusting him from an appointment
      of which they had morally guaranteed the continuance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (12) Louis XIV., the great King, punished with the Galleys those
      Protestants who, once converted, often by force, afterwards returned to
      their first belief. As for those Protestants who remained in France,
      notwithstanding the rigor of the edicts against them, they were deprived
      of burial, dragged upon a hurdle, and given to the dogs.&mdash;E. S.

      CHAPTER XV. THE THUG.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny resumed &ldquo;Read me to-day&rsquo;s
      report on the situation of each of the persons designated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is that of this evening; it has just come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin read as follows: &ldquo;Jacques Rennepont, alias Sleepinbuff, was
      seen in the interior of the debtors&rsquo; prison at eight o&rsquo;clock
      this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not disturb us to-morrow. One; go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady superior of St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, warned by the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier, has thought fit to confine still more strictly
      the Demoiselles Rose and Blanche Simon. This evening, at nine o&rsquo;clock,
      they have been carefully locked in their cells, and armed men will make
      their round in the convent garden during the night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to these precautions, there is nothing to fear from that
      side,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Baleinier, also warned by the Princess de Saint-Dizier,
      continues to have Mdlle. de Cardoville very closely watched. At a quarter
      to nine the door of the building in which she is lodged was locked and
      bolted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is still another cause the less for uneasiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for M. Hardy,&rdquo; resumed Rodin &ldquo;I have received this
      morning, from Toulouse, a letter from his intimate friend, M. de Bressac,
      who has been of such service to us in keeping the manufacturer away for
      some days longer. This letter contains a note, addressed by M. Hardy to a
      confidential person, which M. de Bressac has thought fit to intercept, and
      send to us as another proof of the success of the steps he has taken, and
      for which he hopes we shall give him credit&mdash;as to serve us, he adds,
      he betrays his friend in the most shameful manner, and acts a part in an
      odious comedy. M. de Bressac trusts that, in return for these good
      offices, we will deliver up to him those papers, which place him in our
      absolute dependence, as they might ruin for ever a woman he loves with an
      adulterous passion. He says that we ought to have pity on the horrible
      alternative in which he is placed&mdash;either to dishonor and ruin the
      woman he adores, or infamously to betray the confidence of his bosom
      friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These adulterous lamentations are not deserving of pity,&rdquo;
      answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with contempt. &ldquo;We will see about
      that; M. de Bressac may still be useful to us. But let us hear this letter
      of M. Hardy, that impious and republican manufacturer, worthy descendant
      of an accursed race, whom it is of the first importance to keep away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is M. Hardy&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; resumed Rodin. &ldquo;To-morrow,
      we will send it to the person to whom it is addressed.&rdquo; Rodin read
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TOULOUSE, February the 10th.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length I find a moment to write to you, and to explain the cause
      of the sudden departure which, without alarming, must at least have
      astonished you. I write also to ask you a service; the facts may be stated
      in a few words. I have often spoken to you of Felix de Bressac, one of my
      boyhood mates, though not nearly so old as myself. We have always loved
      each other tenderly, and have shown too many proofs of mutual affection
      not to count upon one another. He is a brother to me. You know all I mean
      by that expression. Well&mdash;a few days ago, he wrote to me from
      Toulouse, where he was to spend some time: &lsquo;If you love me, come; I
      have the greatest need of you. At once! Your consolations may perhaps give
      me the courage to live. If you arrive too late&mdash;why, forgive me&mdash;and
      think sometimes of him who will be yours to the last.&rsquo; Judge of my
      grief and fear on receipt of the above. I seat instantly for post-horses.
      My old foreman, whom I esteem and revere (the father of General Simon),
      hearing that I was going to the south, begged me to take him with me, and
      to leave him for some days in the department of the Creuse, to examine
      some ironworks recently founded there. I consented willingly to this
      proposition, as I should thus at least have some one to whom I could pour
      out the grief and anxiety which had been caused by this letter from
      Bressac. I arrive at Toulouse; they tell me that he left the evening
      before, taking arms with him, a prey to the most violent despair. It was
      impossible at first to tell whither he had gone; after two days, some
      indications, collected with great trouble, put me upon his track. At last,
      after a thousand adventures, I found him in a miserable village. Never&mdash;no,
      never, have I seen despair like this. No violence, but a dreadful
      dejection, a savage silence. At first, he almost repulsed me; then, this
      horrible agony having reached its height, he softened by degrees, and, in
      about a quarter of an hour, threw himself into my arms, bathed in tears.
      Beside him were his loaded pistols: one day later, and all would have been
      over. I cannot tell you the reason of his despair; I am not at liberty to
      do so; but it did not greatly astonish me. Now there is a complete cure to
      effect. We must calm, and soothe, and heal this poor soul, which has been
      cruelly wounded. The hand of friendship is alone equal to this delicate
      task, and I have good hope of success. I have therefore persuaded him to
      travel for some time; movement and change of scene will be favorable to
      him. I shall take him first to Nice; we set out tomorrow. If he wishes to
      prolong this excursion. I shall do so too, for my affairs do not
      imperiously demand my presence in Paris before the end of March. As for
      the service I have to ask of you, it is conditional. These are the facts.
      According to some family papers that belonged to my mother, it seems I
      have a certain interest to present myself at No. 3, Rue Saint-Francois, in
      Paris, on the 13th of February. I had inquired about it, and could learn
      nothing, except that this house of very antique appearance, has been shut
      up for the last hundred and fifty years, through a whim of one of my
      maternal ancestors, and that it is to be opened on the 13th of this month,
      in presence of the co-heirs who, if I have any, are quite unknown to me.
      Not being able to attend myself, I have written to my foreman, the father
      of General Simon, in whom I have the greatest confidence, and whom I had
      left behind in the department of the Creuse, to set out for Paris, and to
      be present at the opening of this house, not as an agent (which would be
      useless), but as a spectator, and inform me at Nice what has been the
      result of this romantic notion of my ancestor&rsquo;s. As it is possible
      that my foreman may arrive too late to accomplish this mission, I should
      be much obliged if you would inquire at my house at Plessy, if he has yet
      come, and, in case of his still being absent, if you would take his place
      at the opening of the house in the Rue Saint-Francois. I believe that I
      have made a very small sacrifice for my friend Bressac, in not being in
      Paris on that day. But had the sacrifice been immense, I should have made
      it with pleasure, for my care and friendship are at present most necessary
      to the man whom I look upon as a brother. I count upon your compliance
      with my request, and, begging you to be kind enough to write me, &lsquo;to
      be called for,&rsquo; at Nice, the result of your visit of inquiry, I
      remain, etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FRANCIS HARDY.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though his presence cannot be of any great importance, it would be
      preferable that Marshal Simon&rsquo;s father should not attend at the
      opening of this house to-morrow,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      &ldquo;But no matter. M. Hardy himself is out of the way. There only
      remains the young Indian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for him,&rdquo; continued the abbe, with a thoughtful air,
      &ldquo;we acted wisely in letting M. Norval set out with the presents of
      Mdlle. de Cardoville. The doctor who accompanies M. Norval, and who was
      chosen by M. Baleinier, will inspire no suspicion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; answered Rodin. &ldquo;His letter of yesterday is
      completely satisfactory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing, then, to fear from the Indian prince,&rdquo; said
      D&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;All goes well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Gabriel,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;he has again written
      this morning, to obtain from your reverence the interview that he has
      vainly solicited for the last three days. He is affected by the rigor
      exercised towards him, in forbidding him to leave the house for these five
      days past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, when we take him to the Rue Saint-Francois, I will hear
      what he has to say. It will be time enough. Thus, at this hour,&rdquo;
      said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with an air of triumphant satisfaction,
      &ldquo;all the descendants of this family, whose presence might ruin our
      projects, are so placed that it is absolutely impossible for them to be at
      the Rue Saint-Francois to-morrow before noon, while Gabriel will be sure
      to be there. At last our end is gained.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two cautious knocks at the door interrupted Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old servant in black presented himself, and said: &ldquo;There is a man
      downstairs who wishes to speak instantly to M. Rodin on very urgent
      business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name?&rdquo; asked Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not tell his name; but he says that he comes from M. Van
      Dael, a merchant in Java.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin exchanged a glance of surprise, almost
      of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what this man is,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Aigrigny to Rodin, unable
      to conceal his uneasiness, &ldquo;and then come and give me an account of
      it.&rdquo; Then, addressing the servant, he added: &ldquo;Show him in&rdquo;&mdash;and
      exchanging another expressive sign with Rodin, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      disappeared by a side-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute after, Faringhea, the ex-chief of the Stranglers, appeared before
      Rodin, who instantly remembered having seen him at Cardoville Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socius started, but he did not wish to appear to recollect his
      visitor. Still bending over his desk, he seemed not to seen Faringhea, but
      wrote hastily some words on a sheet of paper that lay before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the servant, astonished at the silence of Rodin,
      &ldquo;here is the person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin folded the note that he had so precipitately written, and said to
      the servant: &ldquo;Let this be taken to its address. Wait for an answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed, and went out. Then Rodin, without rising, fixed his
      little reptile-eyes on Faringhea, and said to him courteously: &ldquo;To
      whom, sir, have I the honor of speaking?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI. THE TWO BROTHERS OF THE GOOD WORK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>aringhea, as we
      have before stated, though born in India, had travelled a good deal, and
      frequented the European factories in different parts of Asia. Speaking
      well both English and French, and full of intelligence and sagacity, he
      was perfectly civilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering Rodin&rsquo;s question, he turned upon him a fixed
      and searching look. The socius, provoked by this silence, and forseeing
      vaguely that Faringhea&rsquo;s arrival had some connection&mdash;direct or
      indirect&mdash;with Djalma, repeated, though still with the greatest
      coolness: &ldquo;To whom, sir, have I the honor of speaking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not recognize me,&rdquo; said Faringhea, advancing two steps
      nearer to Rodin&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think I have ever had the honor of seeing you,&rdquo;
      answered the other, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I recognize you,&rdquo; said Faringhea; &ldquo;I saw you at
      Cardoville Castle the day that a ship and a steamer were wrecked together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Cardoville Castle? It is very possible, sir. I was there when a
      shipwreck took place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that day I called you by your name, and you asked me what I
      wanted. I replied: &lsquo;Nothing now, brother&mdash;hereafter, much.&rsquo;
      The time has arrived. I have come to ask for much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, still impassible, &ldquo;before we
      continue this conversation, which appears hitherto tolerably obscure, I
      must repeat my wish to be informed to whom I have the advantage of
      speaking. You have introduced yourself here under pretext of a commission
      from Mynheer Joshua Van Dael, a respectable merchant of Batavia, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the writing of M. Van Dael?&rdquo; said Faringhea,
      interrupting Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; The half-caste drew from his pocket (he was shabbily
      dressed in European clothes) a long dispatch, which he had taken from one
      Mahal the Smuggler, after strangling him on the beach near Batavia. These
      papers he placed before Rodin&rsquo;s eyes, but without quitting his hold
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed, M. Van Dael&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; said Rodin, and
      he stretched out his hard towards the letter, which Faringhea quickly and
      prudently returned to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to observe, my dear sir, that you have a singular manner
      of executing a commission,&rdquo; said Rodin. &ldquo;This letter, being to
      my address, and having been entrusted to you by M. Van Dael, you ought&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This letter was not entrusted to me by M. Van Dael,&rdquo; said
      Faringhea, interrupting Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then, is it in your possession?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Javanese smuggler betrayed me. Van Dael had secured a passage to
      Alexandria for this man, and had given him this letter to carry with him
      for the European mail. I strangled the smuggler, took the letter, made the
      passage&mdash;and here I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thug had pronounced these words with an air of savage boasting; his
      wild, intrepid glance did not quail before the piercing look of Rodin,
      who, at this strange confession, had hastily raised his head to observe
      the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea thought to astonish or intimidate Rodin by these ferocious
      words; but, to his great surprise, the socius, impassible as a corpse,
      said to him, quite simply: &ldquo;Oh! they strangle people in Java?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there and elsewhere,&rdquo; answered Faringhea, with a bitter
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would prefer to disbelieve you; but I am surprised at your
      sincerity M.&mdash;, what is your name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faringhea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, M. Faringhea, what do you wish to come to? You have
      obtained by an abominable crime, a letter addressed to me, and now you
      hesitate to deliver it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have read it, and it may be useful to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you have read it?&rdquo; said Rodin, disconcerted for a moment.
      Then he resumed: &ldquo;It is true, that judging by your mode of
      possessing yourself of other people&rsquo;s correspondence, we cannot
      expect any great amount of honesty on your part. And pray what have you
      found so useful to you in this letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found, brother, that you are, like myself, a son of the Good
      Work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what good work do you speak&rdquo; asked Rodin not a little
      surprised.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20165.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Faringhea replied with an expression of bitter irony. &ldquo;Joshua says
      to you in his letter&mdash;&lsquo;Obedience and courage, secrecy and
      patience, craft and audacity, union between us, who have the world for our
      country, the brethren for our family, Rome for our queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that M. Van Dael has written thus to me Pray, sir,
      what do you conclude from it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, too, have the world for our country, brother, our accomplices
      for our family, and for our queen Bowanee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know that saint,&rdquo; said Rodin, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our Rome,&rdquo; answered the Strangler. &ldquo;Van Dael
      speaks to you of those of your Order, who, scattered over all the earth,
      labor for the glory of Rome, your queen. Those of our band labor also in
      divers countries, for the glory of Bowanee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are these sons of Bowanee, M. Faringhea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men of resolution, audacious, patient, crafty, obstinate, who, to
      make the Good Work succeed, would sacrifice country and parents, and
      sister and brother, and who regard as enemies all not of their band!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be much that is good in the persevering and
      exclusively religious spirit of such an order,&rdquo; said Rodin, with a
      modest and sanctified air; &ldquo;only, one must know your ends and
      objects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as your own, brother&mdash;we make corpses.&rdquo;(13)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corpses!&rdquo; cried Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this letter,&rdquo; resumed Faringhea, &ldquo;Van Dael tells you
      that the greatest glory of your Order is to make &lsquo;a corpse of man.&rsquo;
      Our work also is to make corpses of men. Man&rsquo;s death is sweet to
      Bowanee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sir,&rdquo; cried Rodin, &ldquo;M. Van Dael speaks of the soul,
      of the will, of the mind, which are to be brought down by discipline.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true&mdash;you kill the soul, and we the body. Give me your
      hand, brother, for you also are hunters of men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But once more, sir,&mdash;understand, that we only meddle with the
      will, the mind,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are bodies deprived of soul, will, thought, but mere
      corpses? Come&mdash;come, brother; the dead we make by the cord are not
      more icy and inanimate than those you make by your discipline. Take my
      hand, brother; Rome and Bowanee are sisters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his apparent calmness, Rodin could not behold, without
      some secret alarm, a wretch like Faringhea in possession of a long letter
      from Van Dael, wherein mention must necessarily have been made of Djalma.
      Rodin believed, indeed, that he had rendered it impossible for the young
      Indian to be at Paris on the morrow, but not knowing what connection might
      have been formed, since the shipwreck, between the prince and the
      half-caste, he looked upon Faringhea as a man who might probably be very
      dangerous. But the more uneasy the socius felt in himself, the more he
      affected to appear calm and disdainful. He replied, therefore: &ldquo;This
      comparison between Rome and Bowanee is no doubt very amusing; but what,
      sir, do you deduce from it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to show you, brother, what I am, and of what I am capable,
      to convince you that it is better to have me for a friend than an enemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other terms, sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, with contemptuous irony,
      &ldquo;you belong to a murderous sect in India, and, you wish, by a
      transparent allegory, to lead me to reflect on the fate of the man from
      whom you have stolen the letter addressed to me. In my turn, I will take
      the freedom just to observe to you, in all humility, M. Faringhea, that
      here it is not permitted to strangle anybody, and that if you were to
      think fit to make any corpses for the love of Bowanee, your goddess, we
      should make you a head shorter, for the love of another divinity commonly
      called justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would they do to me, if I tried to poison any one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will again humbly observe to you, M. Faringhea, that I have no
      time to give you a course of criminal jurisprudence; but, believe me, you
      had better resist the temptation to strangle or poison any one. One word
      more: will you deliver up to me the letters of M. Van Dael, or not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters relative to Prince Djalma?&rdquo; said the half-caste,
      looking fixedly at Rodin, who, notwithstanding a sharp and sudden twinge,
      remained impenetrable, and answered with the utmost simplicity: &ldquo;Not
      knowing what the letters which you, sir, are pleased to keep from me, may
      contain, it is impossible for me to answer your question. I beg, and if
      necessary, I demand, that you will hand me those letters&mdash;or that you
      will retire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few minutes, brother, you will entreat me to remain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few words will operate&mdash;this miracle. If just now I spoke to
      you about poisoning, brother, it was because you sent a doctor to
      Cardoville Castle, to poison (at least for a time) Prince Djalma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, Rodin started almost imperceptibly, as he replied:
      &ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, that I am a poor foreigner, and doubtless speak with an
      accent; I will try and explain myself better. I know, by Van Dael&rsquo;s
      letters, the interest you have that Prince Djalma should not be here to
      morrow, and all that you have done with this view. Do you understand me
      now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no answer for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two cautious taps at the door here interrupted the conversation. &ldquo;Come
      in,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter has been taken to its address, sir,&rdquo; said the old
      servant, bowing, &ldquo;and here is the answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin took the paper, and, before he opened it, said courteously to
      Faringhea: &ldquo;With your permission, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make no ceremonies,&rdquo; said the half-caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; replied Rodin, as, having read the letter
      he received, he wrote hastily some words at the bottom, saying: &ldquo;Send
      this back to the same address.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed respectfully, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now can I continue&rdquo;&rsquo; asked the half-caste, of Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will continue, then,&rdquo; resumed Faringhea:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before yesterday, just as the prince, all wounded as he
      was, was about, by my advice, to take his departure for Paris, a fine
      carriage arrived, with superb presents for Djalma, from an unknown friend.
      In this carriage were two men&mdash;one sent by the unknown friend&mdash;the
      other a doctor, sent by you to attend upon Djalma, and accompany him to
      Paris. It was a charitable act, brother&mdash;was it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with your story, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma set out yesterday. By declaring that the prince&rsquo;s
      wound would grow seriously worse, if he did not lie down in the carriage
      during all the journey, the doctor got rid of the envoy of the unknown
      friend, who went away by himself. The doctor wished to get rid of me too;
      but Djalma so strongly insisted upon it, that I accompanied the prince and
      doctor. Yesterday evening, we had come about half the distance. The doctor
      proposed we should pass the night at an inn. &lsquo;We have plenty of
      time,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to reach Paris by to-morrow evening&rsquo;&mdash;the
      prince having told him, that he must absolutely be in Paris by the evening
      of the 12th. The doctor had been very pressing to set out alone with the
      prince. I knew by Van Dael&rsquo;s letter, that it was of great importance
      to you for Djalma not to be here on the 13th; I had my suspicions, and I
      asked the doctor if he knew you; he answered with an embarrassed air, and
      then my suspicion became certainty. When we reached the inn, whilst the
      doctor was occupied with Djalma, I went up to the room of the former, and
      examined a box full of phials that he had brought with him. One of them
      contained opium&mdash;and then I guessed&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you guess, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know. The doctor said to Djalma, before he left him:
      &lsquo;Your wound is doing well, but the fatigue of the journey might
      bring on inflammation; it will be good for you, in the course of
      to-morrow, to take a soothing potion, that I will make ready this evening,
      to have with us in the carriage.&rsquo; The doctor&rsquo;s plan was a
      simple one,&rdquo; added Faringhea; &ldquo;to-day the prince was to take
      the potion at four or five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon&mdash;and fall
      into a deep sleep&mdash;the doctor to grow uneasy, and stop the carriage&mdash;to
      declare that it would be dangerous to continue the journey&mdash;to pass
      the night at an inn, and keep close watch over the prince, whose stupor
      was only, to cease when it suited your purposes. That was your design&mdash;it
      was cleverly planned&mdash;I chose to make use of it myself, and I have
      succeeded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you are talking about, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      biting his nails, &ldquo;is pure Hebrew to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, because of my accent. But tell me, have you heard speak
      of array&mdash;mow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loss! It is an admirable production of the Island of Java, so
      fertile in poisons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to me?&rdquo; said Rodin, in a sharp voice, but hardly
      able to dissemble his growing anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It concerns you nearly. We sons of Bowanee have a horror of
      shedding blood,&rdquo; resumed Faringhea; &ldquo;to pass the cord round
      the neck of our victims, we wait till they are asleep. When their sleep is
      not deep enough, we know how to make it deeper. We are skillful at our
      work; the serpent is not more cunning, or the lion more valiant, Djalma
      himself bears our mark. The array-mow is an impalpable powder, and, by
      letting the sleeper inhale a few grains of it, or by mixing it with the
      tobacco to be smoked by a waking man, we can throw our victim into a
      stupor, from which nothing will rouse him. If we fear to administer too
      strong a dose at once, we let the sleeper inhale a little at different
      times, and we can thus prolong the trance at pleasure, and without any
      danger, as long as a man does not require meat and drink&mdash;say, thirty
      or forty hours. You see, that opium is mere trash compared to this divine
      narcotic. I had brought some of this with me from Java&mdash;as a mere
      curiosity, you know&mdash;without forgetting the counter poison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there is a counter-poison, then?&rdquo; said Rodin,
      mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as there are people quite contrary to what we are, brother of
      the good work. The Javanese call the juice of this root tooboe; it
      dissipates the stupor caused by the array-mow, as the sun disperses the
      clouds. Now, yesterday evening, being certain of the projects of your
      emissary against Djalma, I waited till the doctor was in bed and asleep. I
      crept into his room, and made him inhale such a dose of array-mow&mdash;that
      he is probably sleeping still.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miscreant!&rdquo; cried Rodin, more and more alarmed by this
      narrative, for Faringhea had dealt a terrible blow at the machinations of
      the socius and his friends. &ldquo;You risk poisoning the doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, brother; just as he ran the risk of poisoning Djalma. This
      morning we set out, leaving your doctor at the inn, plunged in a deep
      sleep. I was alone in the carriage with Djalma. He smoked like a true
      Indian; some grains of array-mow, mixed with the tobacco in his long pipe,
      first made him drowsy; a second dose, that he inhaled, sent him to sleep;
      and so I left him at the inn where we stopped. Now, brother, it depends
      upon me, to leave Djalma in his trance, which will last till to-morrow
      evening or to rouse him from it on the instant. Exactly as you comply with
      my demands or not, Djalma will or will not be in the Rue Saint-Francois to
      morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Faringhea drew from his pocket the medal belonging to Djalma,
      and observed, as he showed it to Rodin: &ldquo;You see that I tell you the
      truth. During Djalma&rsquo;s sleep, took from him this medal, the only
      indication he has of the place where he ought to be to-morrow. I finish,
      then as I began: Brother, I have come to ask you for a great deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes, Rodin had been biting his nails to the quick, as was his
      custom when seized with a fit of dumb and concentrated rage. Just then,
      the bell of the porter&rsquo;s lodge rang three times in a particular
      manner. Rodin did not appear to notice it, and yet a sudden light sparkled
      in his small reptile eyes; while Faringhea, with his arms folded, looked
      at him with an expression of triumph and disdainful superiority. The
      socius bent down his head, remained silent for some seconds, took
      mechanically a pen from his desk, and began to gnaw the feather, as if in
      deep reflection upon what Faringhea had just said. Then, throwing down the
      pen upon the desk, he turned suddenly towards the half-caste, and
      addressed him with an air of profound contempt &ldquo;Now, really, M.
      Faringhea&mdash;do you think to make game of us with your cock-and bull
      stories?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed, in spite of his audacity, the half-caste recoiled a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir!&rdquo; resumed Rodin. &ldquo;You come here into a
      respectable house, to boast that you have stolen letters, strangled this
      man, drugged that other?&mdash;Why, sir, it is downright madness. I wished
      to hear you to the end, to see to what extent you would carry your
      audacity&mdash;for none but a monstrous rascal would venture to plume
      himself on such infamous crimes. But I prefer believing, that they exist
      only in your imagination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he barked out these words, with a degree of animation not usual in him,
      Rodin rose from his seat, and approached the chimney, while Faringhea, who
      had not yet recovered from his surprise, looked at him in silence. In a
      few seconds, however, the half-caste returned, with a gloomy and savage
      mien: &ldquo;Take care, brother; do not force me to prove to you that I
      have told the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, sir; you must be fresh from the Antipodes, to believe
      us Frenchmen such easy dupes. You have, you say, the prudence of a
      serpent, and the courage of a lion. I do not know if you are a courageous
      lion, but you are certainly not a prudent serpent. What! you have about
      you a letter from M. Van Dael, by which I might be compromised&mdash;supposing
      all this not to be a fable&mdash;you have left Prince Djalma in a stupor,
      which would serve my projects, and from which you alone can rouse him&mdash;you
      are able, you say, to strike a terrible blow at my interests&mdash;and yet
      you do not consider (bold lion! crafty serpent as you are!) that I only
      want to gain twenty-four hours upon you. Now, you come from the end of
      India to Paris, an unknown stranger&mdash;you believe me to be as great a
      scoundrel as yourself,&mdash;since you call me brother&mdash;and do not
      once consider, that you are here in my power&mdash;that this street and
      house are solitary, and that I could have three or four persons to bind
      you in a second, savage Strangler though you are!&mdash;and that just by
      pulling this bell-rope,&rdquo; said Rodin, as he took it in his hand.
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed,&rdquo; added he, with a diabolical smile, as he
      saw Faringhea make an abrupt movement of surprise and fright; &ldquo;would
      I give you notice, if I meant to act in this manner?&mdash;But just answer
      me. Once bound and put in confinement for twenty-four hours, how could you
      injure me? Would it not be easy for me to possess myself of Van Dael&rsquo;s
      letter, and Djalma&rsquo;s medal? and the latter, plunged in a stupor till
      to-morrow evening, need not trouble me at all. You see, therefore, that
      your threats are vain because they rest upon falsehood&mdash;because it is
      not true, that Prince Djalma is here and in your power. Begone, sir&mdash;leave
      the house; and when next you wish to make dupes, show more judgment in the
      selection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea seemed struck with astonishment. All that he had just heard
      seemed very probable. Rodin might seize upon him, the letter, and the
      medal, and, by keeping him prisoner, prevent Djalma from being awakened.
      And yet Rodin ordered him to leave the house, at the moment when Faringhea
      had imagined himself so formidable. As he thought for the motives of this
      inexplicable conduct, it struck him that Rodin, notwithstanding the proofs
      he had brought him, did not yet believe that Djalma was in his power. On
      that theory, the contempt of Van Dael&rsquo;s correspondent admitted of a
      natural explanation. But Rodin was playing a bold and skillful game; and,
      while he appeared to mutter to himself, as in anger, he was observing,
      with intense anxiety, the Strangler&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, almost certain that he had divined the secret motive of Rodin,
      replied: &ldquo;I am going&mdash;but one word more. You think I deceive
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain of it. You have told me nothing but a tissue of
      fables, and I have lost much time in listening to them. Spare me the rest;
      it is late&mdash;and I should like to be alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute more: you are a man, I see, from whom nothing should be
      hid,&rdquo; said Faringhea, &ldquo;from Djalma, I could now only expect
      alms and disdain&mdash;for, with a character like this, to say to him,
      &lsquo;Pay me, because I might have betrayed you and did not,&rsquo; would
      be to provoke his anger and contempt. I could have killed him twenty times
      over, but his day is not yet come,&rdquo; said the Thug, with a gloomy
      air; &ldquo;and to wait for that and other fatal days, I must have gold,
      much gold. You alone can pay me for the betrayal of Djalma, for you alone
      profit by it. You refuse to hear me, because you think I am deceiving you.
      But I took the direction of the inn where we stopped&mdash;and here it is.
      Send some one to ascertain the truth of what I tell you, and then you will
      believe me. But the price of my services will be high; for I told you that
      I wanted much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Faringhea offered a printed card to Rodin: the socius, who, out
      of the corner of his eye, followed all the half-caste&rsquo;s movements,
      appeared to be absorbed in thought, and taking no heed of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the address,&rdquo; repeated Faringhea, as he held out the
      card to Rodin; &ldquo;assure yourself that I do not lie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? what is it?&rdquo; said the other, casting a rapid but stolen
      glance at the address, which he read greedily, without touching the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this address,&rdquo; repeated the half-caste, &ldquo;and you
      may then assure yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; cried Rodin, pushing back the card with his
      hand, &ldquo;your impudence confounds me. I repeat that I wish to have
      nothing in common with you. For the last time, I tell you to leave the
      house. I know nothing about your Prince Djalma. You say you can injure me&mdash;do
      so&mdash;make no ceremonies&mdash;but, in heaven&rsquo;s name, leave me to
      myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rodin rang the bell violently. Faringhea made a movement as if
      to stand upon the defensive; but only the old servant, with his quiet and
      placid mien, appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lapierre, light the gentleman out,&rdquo; said Rodin, pointing to
      Faringhea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrified at Rodin&rsquo;s calmness, the half-caste hesitated to leave the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you wait, sir?&rdquo; said Rodin, remarking his hesitation.
      &ldquo;I wish to be alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Faringhea, as he withdrew, slowly, &ldquo;you
      refuse my offers? Take care! to-morrow it will be too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor to be your most humble servant, sir,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, bowing courteously. The Strangler went out, and the door closed
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny entered from the next room. His
      countenance was pale and agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; exclaimed he addressing Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard all. I am unfortunately too sure that this wretch
      spoke the truth. The Indian is in his power, and he goes to rejoin him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Rodin, humbly, as bowing, he reassumed his
      dull and submissive countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will prevent this man from rejoining the prince?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me. As soon as the rascal was shown in, I knew him; and so,
      before speaking a word to him, I wrote a few lines to Morok, who was
      waiting below with Goliath till your reverence should be at leisure.
      Afterwards, in the course of the conversation, when they brought me Morok&rsquo;s
      answer, I added some fresh instructions, seeing the turn that affairs were
      taking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the use of all this, since you have let the man leave
      the house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reverence will perhaps deign to observe that he did not leave
      it; till he had given me the direction of the hotel where the Indian now
      is, thanks to my innocent stratagem of appearing to despise him. But, if
      it had failed, Faringhea would still have fallen into the hands of Goliath
      and Morok, who are waiting for him in the street, a few steps from the
      door. Only we should have been rather embarrassed, as we should not have
      known where to find Prince Djalma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More violence!&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with
      repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be regretted, very much regretted,&rdquo; replied Rodin;
      &ldquo;but it was necessary to follow out the system already adopted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that meant for a reproach?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      who began to think that Rodin was something more than a mere
      writing-machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not permit myself to blame your reverence,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, cringing almost to the ground. &ldquo;But all that will be required
      is to confine this man for twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterwards&mdash;his complaints?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a scoundrel as he is will not dare to complain. Besides, he
      left this house in freedom. Morok and Goliath will bandage his eyes when
      they seize him. The house has another entrance in the Rue
      Vieille-des-Ursins. At this hour, and in such a storm, no one will be
      passing through this deserted quarter of the town. The knave will be
      confused by the change of place; they will put him into a cellar, of the
      new building, and to morrow night, about the same hour, they will restore
      him to liberty with the like precautions. As for the East Indian, we now
      know where to find him; we must send to him a confidential person, and, if
      he recovers from his trance, there would be, in my humble opinion,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, modestly, &ldquo;a very simple and quiet manner of keeping him
      away from the Rue Saint Francois all day to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same servant with the mild countenance, who had introduced and shown
      out Faringhea, here entered the room, after knocking discreetly at the
      door. He held in his hand a sort of game-bag, which he gave to Rodin,
      saying: &ldquo;Here is what M. Morok has just brought; he came in by the
      Rue Vieille.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant withdrew, and Rodin, opening the bag, said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      as he showed him the contents: &ldquo;The medal, and Van Dael&rsquo;s
      letter. Morok has been quick at his work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more danger avoided,&rdquo; said the marquis; &ldquo;it is a
      pity to be forced to such measures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must only blame the rascal who has obliged us to have recourse
      to them. I will send instantly to the hotel where the Indian lodges.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, at seven in the morning, you will conduct Gabriel to the Rue
      Saint Francois. It is there that I must have with him the interview which
      he has so earnestly demanded these three days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I informed him of it this evening, and he awaits your orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, then,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;after so
      many struggles, and fears, and crosses, only a few hours separate us from
      the moment which we have so long desired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We now conduct the reader to the house in the Rue Saint-Francois.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. THE HOUSE IN THE RUE SAINT-FRANCOIS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n entering the Rue
      Saint-Gervais, by the Rue Dore (in the Marais), you would have found
      yourself, at the epoch of this narrative, directly opposite to an
      enormously high wall, the stones of which were black and worm-eaten with
      age. This wall, which extended nearly the whole length of that solitary
      street, served to support a terrace shaded by trees of some hundred years
      old, which thus grew about forty feet above the causeway. Through their
      thick branches appeared the stone front, peaked roof and tall brick
      chimneys of an antique house, the entrance of which was situated in the
      Rue Saint-Francois, not far from the Rue Saint Gervais corner. Nothing
      could be more gloomy than the exterior of this abode. On the entrance-side
      also was a very high wall, pierced with two or three loop-holes, strongly
      grated. A carriage gateway in massive oak, barred with iron, and studded
      with large nail-heads, whose primitive color disappeared beneath a thick
      layer of mud, dust, and rust, fitted close into the arch of a deep recess,
      forming the swell of a bay window above. In one of these massive gates was
      a smaller door, which served for ingress and egress to Samuel the Jew, the
      guardian of this dreary abode. On passing the threshold, you came to a
      passage, formed in the building which faced in the street. In this
      building was the lodging of Samuel, with its windows opening upon the
      rather spacious inner court yard, through the railing of which you
      perceived the garden. In the middle of this garden stood a two-storied
      stone house, so strangely built, that you had to mount a flight of steps,
      or rather a double-flight of at least twenty steps, to reach the door,
      which had been walled up a hundred and fifty years before. The
      window-blinds of this habitation had been replaced by large thick plates
      of lead, hermetically soldered and kept in by frames of iron clamped in
      the stone. Moreover, completely to intercept air and light, and thus to
      guard against decay within and without, the roof had been covered with
      thick sheets of lead, as well as the vents of the tall chimneys, which had
      previously been bricked up. The same precautions had been taken with
      respect to a small square belvedere, situated on the top of the house;
      this glass cage was covered with a sort of dome, soldered to the roof.
      Only, in consequence of some singular fancy, in every one of the leaden
      plates, which concealed the four sides of the belvedere, corresponding to
      the cardinal points, seven little round holes had been bored in the form
      of a cross, and were easily distinguishable from the outside. Everywhere
      else the plates of lead were completely unpierced. Thanks to these
      precautions, and to the substantial structure of the building, nothing but
      a few outward repairs had been necessary; and the apartments, entirely
      removed from the influence of the external air, no doubt remained, during
      a century and a half, exactly in the same state as at the time of their
      being shut up. The aspect of walls in crevices, of broken, worm-eaten
      shutters, of a roof half fallen in, and windows covered with wall-flowers,
      would perhaps have been less sad than the appearance of this stone house,
      plated with iron and lead, and preserved like a mausoleum. The garden,
      completely deserted, and only regularly visited once a week by Samuel,
      presented to the view, particularly in summer, an incredible confusion of
      parasites and brambles. The trees, left to themselves, had shot forth and
      mingled their branches in all directions; some straggling vines,
      reproduced from offshoots, had crept along the ground to the foot of the
      trees, and, climbing up their trunks, had twined themselves about them,
      and encircled their highest branches with their inextricable net. You
      could only pass through this virgin forest by following the path made by
      the guardian, to go from the grating to the house, the approaches to which
      were a little sloped to let the water run off, and carefully paved to the
      width of about ten feet. Another narrow path which extended all around the
      enclosure, was every night perambulated by two or three Pyrenees dogs&mdash;a
      faithful race, which had been perpetuated in the house during a century
      and a half. Such was the habitation destined for the meeting of the
      descendants of the family of Rennepont. The night which separated the 12th
      from the 13th day of February was near its close. A calm had succeeded the
      storm, and the rain had ceased; the sky was clear and full of stars; the
      moon, on its decline, shone with a mild lustre, and threw a melancholy
      light over that deserted, silent house, whose threshold for so many years
      no human footstep had crossed.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20177.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      A bright gleam of light, issuing from one of the windows of the guardian&rsquo;s
      dwelling, announced that Samuel was awake. Figure to yourself a tolerably
      large room, lined from top to bottom with old walnut wainscoting browned
      to an almost black, with age. Two half-extinguished brands are smoking
      amid the cinders on the hearth. On the stone mantelpiece, painted to
      resemble gray granite, stands an old iron candlestick, furnished with a
      meagre candle, capped by an extinguisher. Near it one sees a pair of
      double-barrelled pistols, and a sharp cutlass, with a hilt of carved
      bronze, belonging to the seventeenth century. Moreover, a heavy rifle
      rests against one of the chimney jambs. Four stools, an old oak press, and
      a square table with twisted legs, formed the sole furniture of this
      apartment. Against the wall were systematically suspended a number of keys
      of different sizes, the shape of which bore evidence to their antiquity,
      whilst to their rings were affixed divers labels. The back of the old
      press, which moved by a secret spring, had been pushed aside, and
      discovered, built in the wall, a large and deep iron chest, the lid of
      which, being open, displayed the wondrous mechanism of one of those
      Florentine locks of the sixteenth century, which, better than any modern
      invention, set all picklocks at defiance; and, moreover, according to the
      notions of that age, are supplied with a thick lining of asbestos cloth,
      suspended by gold wire at a distance from the sides of the chest, for the
      purpose of rendering incombustible the articles contained in it. A large
      cedar-wood box had been taken from the chest, and placed upon a stool; it
      contained numerous papers, carefully arranged and docketed. By the light
      of a brass lamp, the old keeper Samuel, was writing in a small register,
      whilst Bathsheba, his wife, was dictating to him from an account. Samuel
      was about eighty two years old, and, notwithstanding his advanced age, a
      mass of gray curling hair covered his head. He was short, thin, nervous,
      and the involuntary petulance of his movements proved that years had not
      weakened his energy and activity; though, out of doors, where, however, he
      made his appearance very seldom, he affected a sort of second childhood,
      as had been remarked by Rodin to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. An old
      dressing-gown, of maroon-colored camlet, with large sleeves, completely
      enveloped the old man, and reached to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel&rsquo;s features were cast in the pure, Eastern mould of his race.
      His complexion was of a dead yellow, his nose aquiline, his chin shaded by
      a little tuft of white beard, while projecting cheek-bones threw a harsh
      shadow upon the hollow and wrinkled cheeks. His countenance was full of
      intelligence, fine sharpness, and sagacity. On his broad, high forehead
      one might read frankness, honesty, and firmness; his eyes, black and
      brilliant as an Arab&rsquo;s, were at once mild and piercing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, Bathsheba, some fifteen years younger than himself, was of tall
      stature, and dressed entirely in black. A low cap, of starched lawn, which
      reminded one of the grave head-dresses of Dutch matrons, encircled a pale
      and austere countenance, formerly of a rare and haughty beauty, and
      impressed with the Scriptural character. Some lines in the forehead,
      caused by the almost continual knitting of her gray brows, showed that
      this woman had often suffered from the pressure of intense grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very moment her countenance betrayed inexpressible sorrow. Her
      look was fixed, her head resting on her bosom. She had let her right hand,
      which held a small account-book, fall upon her lap, while the other hand
      grasped convulsively a long tress of jet-black hair, which she bore about
      her neck. It was fastened by a golden clasp, about an inch square, in
      which, under a plate of crystal, that shut in one side of it like a
      relic-case, could be seen a piece of linen, folded square, and almost
      entirely covered with dark red spots that resembled blood a long time
      dried.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short silence, during which Samuel was occupied with his register,
      he read aloud what he had just been writing: &ldquo;Per contra, 5,000
      Austrian Metallics of 1,000 florins, under date of October 19th, 1826.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After which enumeration, Samuel raised his head, and said to his wife:
      &ldquo;Well, is it right, Bathsheba? Have you compared it with the account
      book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathsheba did not answer. Samuel looked at her, and, seeing that she was
      absorbed in grief, said to her, with an expression of tender anxiety:
      &ldquo;What is the matter? Good heaven! what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 19th of October, 1826,&rdquo; said she, slowly, with her eyes
      still fixed, and pressing yet more closely the lock of black hair which
      she wore about her neck; &ldquo;It was a fatal day&mdash;for, Samuel, it
      was the date of the last letter which we received from&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathsheba was unable to proceed. She uttered a long sigh, and concealed
      her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I understand you,&rdquo; observed the old man, in a tremulous
      voice; &ldquo;a father may be taken up by the thought of other cares; but
      the heart of a mother is ever wakeful.&rdquo; Throwing his pen down upon
      the table, Samuel leaned his forehead upon his hands in sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathsheba resumed, as if she found a melancholy pleasure in these cruel
      remembrances: &ldquo;Yes; that was the last day on which our son, Abel,
      wrote to us from Germany, to announce to us that he had invested the funds
      according to your desire and was going thence into Poland, to effect
      another operation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in Poland he met the death of a martyr,&rdquo; added Samuel.
      &ldquo;With no motive and no proof, they accused him falsely of coming to
      organize smuggling, and the Russian governor, treating him as they treat
      our brothers in that land of cruel tyranny, condemned him to the dreadful
      punishment of the knout, without even hearing him in his defence. Why
      should they hear a Jew? What is a Jew? A creature below a serf, whom they
      reproach for all the vices that a degrading slavery has engendered. A Jew
      beaten to death? Who would trouble themselves about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And poor Abel, so good, so faithful, died beneath their stripes,
      partly from shame, partly from the wounds,&rdquo; said Bathsheba,
      shuddering. &ldquo;One of our Polish brethren obtained with great
      difficulty permission to bury him. He cut off this lock of beautiful black
      hair&mdash;which, with this scrap of linen, bathed in the blood of our
      dear son, is all that now remains to us of him.&rdquo; Bathsheba covered
      the hair and clasp with convulsive kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Samuel, drying his tears, which had burst forth
      at these sad recollections, &ldquo;the Lord did not at last remove our
      child, until the task which our family has accomplished faithfully for a
      century and a half was nearly at an end. Of what use will our race be
      henceforth upon earth?&rdquo; added Samuel, most bitterly. &ldquo;Our duty
      is performed. This casket contains a royal fortune&mdash;and yonder house,
      walled up for a hundred and fifty years, will be opened to-morrow to the
      descendants of my ancestor&rsquo;s benefactor.&rdquo; So saying, Samuel
      turned his face sorrowfully towards the house, which he could see through
      the window. The dawn was just about to appear. The moon had set;
      belvedere, roof, and chimneys formed a black mass upon the dark blue of
      the starry firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Samuel grew pale, and, rising abruptly, said to his wife in a
      tremulous tone, whilst he still pointed to the house: &ldquo;Bathsheba!
      the seven points of light&mdash;just as it was thirty years ago. Look!
      look:&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the seven round holes, bored in the form of a cross in the leaden
      plates which covered the window of the belvedere, sparkled like so many
      luminous points, as if some one in the house ascended with a light to the
      roof.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or some seconds,
      Samuel and Bathsheba remained motionless, with their eyes fixed in fear
      and uneasiness on the seven luminous points, which shone through the
      darkness of the night from the summit of the belvedere; while, on the
      horizon, behind the house, a pale, rosy hue announced the dawn of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel was the first to break silence, and he said to his wife, as he drew
      his hand across his brow: &ldquo;The grief caused by the remembrance of
      our poor child has prevented us from reflecting that, after all, there
      should be nothing to alarm us in what we see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, Samuel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father always told me that he, and my grandfather before him,
      had seen such lights at long intervals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Samuel&mdash;but without being able, any more than ourselves,
      to explain the cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like my father and grandfather, we can only suppose that some
      secret passage gives admittance to persons who, like us, have some
      mysterious duty to fulfil in this dwelling. Besides, my father warned me
      not to be uneasy at these appearances, foretold by him, and now visible
      for the second time in thirty years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that, Samuel, it does strike one as if it was
      something supernatural.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The days of miracles are over.&rdquo; said the Jew, shaking his
      head sorrowfully: &ldquo;many of the old houses in this quarter have
      subterraneous communications with distant places&mdash;some extending even
      to the Seine and the Catacombs. Doubtless, this house is so situated, and
      the persons who make these rare visits enter by some such means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that the belvedere should be thus lighted up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to the plan of the building, you know that the belvedere
      forms a kind of skylight to the apartment called the Great Hall of
      Mourning, situated on the upper story. As it is completely dark, in
      consequence of the closing of all the windows, they must use a light to
      visit this Hall of Mourning&mdash;a room which is said to contain some
      very strange and gloomy things,&rdquo; added the Jew, with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathsheba, as well as her husband, gazed attentively on the seven luminous
      points, which diminished in brightness as the daylight gradually
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you say, Samuel, the mystery may be thus explained,&rdquo;
      resumed the Hebrew&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Besides, the day is so important a
      one for the family of Rennepont, that this apparition: ought not to
      astonish us under the circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to think,&rdquo; remarked Samuel, &ldquo;that these lights
      have appeared at several different times throughout a century and a half!
      There must, therefore, be another family that, like ours, has devoted
      itself, from generation to generation, to accomplish a pious duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is this duty? It will perhaps be explained today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Bathsheba,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Samuel, as if
      roused from his reverie, and reproaching himself with idleness; this is
      the day, and, before eight o&rsquo;clock, our cash account must be in
      order, and these titles to immense property arranged, so that they may be
      delivered to the rightful owners&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the
      cedar-wood box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Samuel; this day does not belong to us. It is a
      solemn day&mdash;one that would have been sweet, oh! very sweet to you and
      me&mdash;if now any days could be sweet to us,&rdquo; said Bathsheba
      bitterly, for she was thinking of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bathsheba,&rdquo; said Samuel, mournfully, as he laid his hand on
      his wife&rsquo;s; &ldquo;we shall at least have the stern satisfaction of
      having done our duty. And has not the Lord been very favorable to us,
      though He has thus severely tried us by the death of our son? Is it not
      thanks to His providence that three generations of my family have been
      able to commence, continue, and finish this great work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Samuel,&rdquo; said the Jewess, affectionately, &ldquo;and for
      you at least this satisfaction will be combined with calm and quietness,
      for on the stroke of noon you will be delivered from a very terrible
      responsibility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Bathsheba pointed to the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;I had rather these
      immense riches were in the hands of those to whom they belong, than in
      mine; but, to day, I shall cease to be their trustee. Once more then, I
      will check the account for the last time, and compare the register with
      the cash-book that you hold in your hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bathsheba bowed her head affirmatively, and Samuel, taking up his pen,
      occupied himself once more with his calculations. His wife, in spite of
      herself, again yielded to the sad thoughts which that fatal date had
      awakened, by reminding her of the death of her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now trace rapidly the history, in appearance so romantic and
      marvellous, in reality so simple, of the fifty thousand crowns, which,
      thanks to the law of accumulation, and to a prudent, intelligent and
      faithful investment, had naturally, and necessarily, been transformed, in
      the space of a century and a half, into a sum far more important than the
      forty millions estimated by Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&mdash;who, partially
      informed on this subject, and reckoning the disastrous accidents, losses,
      and bankruptcies which might have occurred during so long a period,
      believed that forty millions might well b e considered enormous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of this fortune being closely connected with that of the
      Samuel family, by whom it had been managed for three generations, we shall
      give it again in a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the period 1670, some years before his death, Marius de Rennepont,
      then travelling in Portugal, had been enabled, by means of powerful
      interest, to save the life of an unfortunate Jew, condemned to be burnt
      alive by the Inquisition, because of his religion. This Jew was Isaac
      Samuel, grandfather of the present guardian of the house in the Rue
      Saint-Francois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generous men often attach themselves to those they have served, as much,
      at least, as the obliged parties are attached to their benefactors. Having
      ascertained that Isaac, who at that time carried on a petty broker&rsquo;s
      business at Lisbon, was industrious, honest, active, laborious, and
      intelligent, M. de Rennepont, who then possessed large property in France,
      proposed to the Jew to accompany him, and undertake the management of his
      affairs. The same hatred and suspicion with which the Israelites have
      always been followed, was then at its height. Isaac was therefore doubly
      grateful for this mark of confidence on the part of M. de Rennepont. He
      accepted the offer, and promised from that day to devote his existence to
      the service of him who had first saved his life, and then trusted
      implicitly to his good faith and uprightness, although he was a Jew, and
      belonged to a race generally suspected and despised. M. de Rennepont, a
      man of great soul, endowed with a good spirit, was not deceived in his
      choice. Until he was deprived of his fortune, it prospered wonderfully in
      the hands of Isaac Samuel, who, gifted with an admirable aptitude for
      business, applied himself exclusively to advance the interests of his
      benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the persecution and ruin of M. de Rennepont, whose property was
      confiscated and given up to the reverend fathers of the Company of Jesus
      only a few days before his death. Concealed in the retreat he had chosen,
      therein to put a violent end to his life, he sent secretly for Isaac
      Samuel, and delivered to him fifty thousand crowns in gold, the last
      remains of his fortune. This faithful servant was to invest the money to
      the best advantage, and, if he should have a son, transmit to him the same
      obligation; or, should he have no child, he was to seek out some relation
      worthy of continuing this trust, to which would moreover be annexed a fair
      reward. It was thus to be transmitted and perpetuated from relative to
      relative, until the expiration of a century and a half. M. de Rennepont
      also begged Isaac to take charge, during his life, of the house in the Rue
      Saint-Francois, where he would be lodged gratis, and to leave this
      function likewise to his descendants, if it were possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If even Isaac Samuel had not had children, the powerful bond of union
      which exists between certain Jewish families, would have rendered
      practicable the last will of De Rennepont. The relations of Isaac would
      have become partner; in his gratitude to his benefactor, and they, and
      their succeeding generations, would have religiously accomplished the task
      imposed upon one of their race. But, several years after the death of De
      Rennepont, Isaac had a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      This son, Levy Samuel, born in 1689, not having had any children by his
      first wife, married again at nearly sixty years of age, and, in 1750, he
      also had a son&mdash;David Samuel, the guardian of the house in the Rue
      Saint Francois, who, in 1832 (the date of this narrative), was eighty-two
      years old, and seemed likely to live as long as his father, who had died
      at the age of ninety-three. Finally, Abel Samuel, the son whom Bathsheba
      so bitterly regretted, born in 1790, had perished under the Russian knout,
      at the age of thirty-six.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having established this humble genealogy, we easily understand how this
      successive longevity of three members of the Samuel family, all of whom
      had been guardians of the walled house, by uniting, as it were, the
      nineteenth with the seventeenth century, simplified and facilitated the
      execution of M. de Rennepont&rsquo;s will; the latter having declared his
      desire to the grandfather of the Samuels, that the capital should only be
      augmented by interest at five per cent.&mdash;so that the fortune might
      come to his descendants free from all taint of usurious speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow men of the Samuel family, the first inventors of the bill of
      exchange, which served them in the Middle Ages to transport mysteriously
      considerable amounts from one end of the world to the other, to conceal
      their fortune, and to shield it from the rapacity of their enemies&mdash;the
      Jews, we say, having almost the monopoly of the trade in money and
      exchanges, until the end of the eighteenth century, aided the secret
      transactions and financial operations of this family, which, up to about
      1820, placed their different securities, which had become progressively
      immense, in the hands of the principal Israelitish bankers and merchants
      of Europe. This sure and secret manner of acting had enabled the present
      guardian of the house in the Rue Saint-Francois, to effect enormous
      investments, unknown to all; and it was more especially during the period
      of his management, that the capital sum had acquired, by the mere fact of
      compound interest, an almost incalculable development. Compared with him,
      his father and grandfather had only small amounts to manage. Though it had
      only been necessary to find successively sure and immediate investments,
      so that the money might not remain as it were one day without bearing
      interest, it had acquired financial capacity to attain this result, when
      so many millions were in question. The last of the Samuels, brought up in
      the school of his father, had exhibited this capacity in a very high
      degree, as will be seen immediately by the results. Nothing could be more
      touching, noble, and respectable, than the conduct of the members of this
      Jewish family, who, partners in the engagement of gratitude taken by their
      ancestor, devote themselves for long years, with as much disinterestedness
      as intelligence and honesty, to the slow acquisition of a kingly fortune,
      of which they expect no part themselves, but which, thanks to them, would
      come pure, as immense, to the hands of the descendants of their
      benefactor! Nor could anything be more honorable to him who made, and him
      who received this deposit, than the simple promise by word of mouth,
      unaccompanied by any security save mutual confidence and reciprocal
      esteem, when the result was only to be produced at the end of a century
      and a half!
    </p>
    <p>
      After once more reading his inventory with attention, Samuel said to his
      wife: &ldquo;I am certain of the correctness of my additions. Now please
      to compare with the account-book in your hand the summary of the
      investments that I have just entered in the register. I will assure
      myself, at the same time, that the bonds and vouchers are properly
      arranged in this casket, that, on the opening of the will, they may be
      delivered in order to the notary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin, my dear, and I will check you,&rdquo; said Bathsheba.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel read as follows, examining as he went on, the contents of his
      casket:

      &ldquo;It is quite right,&rdquo; said Samuel, after examining the papers,
      contained in the cedar-wood box. &ldquo;There remains in hand, at the
      absolute disposal of the heirs of the Rennepont family, the Sum Of TWO
      HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLIONS, ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS.&rdquo;
      And the old man looked at his wife with an expression of legitimate pride.
      &ldquo;It is hardly credible!&rdquo; cried Bathsheba, struck with
      surprise. &ldquo;I knew that you had immense property in your hands; but I
      could never have believed, that one hundred and fifty thousand francs,

      fortune.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;It is even so, Bathsheba,&rdquo; answered the old man, proudly.
      &ldquo;Doubtless, my grandfather, my father, and myself, have all been
      exact and faithful in the management of these funds; doubtless, we have
      required some sagacity in the choice of investments, in times of
      revolution and commercial panics; but all this was easy to us, thanks to
      our relations with our brethren in all countries&mdash;and never have I,
      or any of mine, made an usurious investment, or even taken the full
      advantage of the legal rate of interest. Such were the positive demands of
      M. de Rennepont, given to my grandfather; nor is there in the world a
      fortune that has been obtained by purer means. Had it not been for this
      disinterestedness, we might have much augmented this two hundred and
      twelve millions, only by taking advantage of a few favorable
      circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! is it possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is more simple, Bathsheba. Every one knows, that in
      fourteen years a capital will be doubled, by the mere accumulation of
      interest and compound interest at five per cent. Now reflect, that in a
      century and a half there are ten times fourteen years, and that these one
      hundred and fifty thousands francs have thus been doubled and redoubled,
      over and over again. All that astonishes you will then appear plain
      enough. In 1682, M. de Rennepont entrusted my grandfather with a hundred
      and fifty thousand francs; this sum, invested as I have told you, would
      have produced in 1696, fourteen years after, three hundred thousand
      francs. These last, doubled in 1710, would produce six hundred thousand.
      On the death of my grandfather in 1719, the amount was already near a
      million; in 1724, it would be twelve hundred thousand francs; in 1738, two
      millions four hundred thousand; in 1752, about two years after my birth,
      four millions eight hundred thousand; in 1766, nine millions six hundred
      thousand; in 1780, nineteen millions two hundred thousand; in 1794, twelve
      years after the death of my father, thirty-eight millions four hundred
      thousand; in 1808, seventy-six millions eight hundred thousand; in 1822,
      one hundred and fifty-three millions six hundred thousand; and, at this
      time, taking the compound interest for ten years, it should be at least
      two hundred and twenty-five millions. But losses and inevitable charges,
      of which the account has been strictly kept, have reduced the sum to two
      hundred and twelve millions one hundred and seventy-five thousand francs,
      the securities for which are in this box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now understand you, my dear,&rdquo; answered Bathsheba,
      thoughtfully; &ldquo;but how wonderful is this power of accumulation! and
      what admirable provision may be made for the future, with the smallest
      present resources!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such, no doubt, was the idea of M. de Rennepont; for my father has
      often told me, and he derived it from his father, that M. de Rennepont was
      one of the soundest intellects of his time,&rdquo; said Samuel, as he
      closed the cedar-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant his descendants may be worthy of this kingly fortune, and
      make a noble use of it!&rdquo; said Bathsheba, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now broad day, and the clock had just struck seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The masons will soon be here,&rdquo; said Samuel, as he replaced
      the cedar-box in the iron safe, concealed behind the antique press.
      &ldquo;Like you, Bathsheba, I am curious and anxious to know, what
      descendants of M. de Rennepont will now present themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three loud knocks on the outer gate resounded through the house.
      The barking of the watch-dogs responded to this summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel said to his wife: &ldquo;It is no doubt the masons, whom the notary
      has sent with his clerk. Tie all the keys and their labels together; I
      will come back and fetch them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Samuel went down to the door with much nimbleness, considering
      his age, prudently opened a small wicket, and saw three workmen, in the
      garb of masons, accompanied by a young man dressed in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may you want, gentlemen?&rdquo; said the Jew, before opening
      the door, as he wished first to make sure of the identity of the
      personages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sent by M. Dumesnil, the notary,&rdquo; answered the clerk,
      &ldquo;to be present at the unwalling of a door. Here is a letter from my
      master, addressed to M. Samuel, guardian of the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am he, sir,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;please to put the letter
      through the slide, and I will take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk did as Samuel desired, but shrugged his shoulders at what he
      considered the ridiculous precautions of a suspicious old man. The
      housekeeper opened the box, took the letter, went to the end of the
      vaulted passage in order to read it, and carefully compared the signature
      with that of another letter which he drew from the pocket of his long
      coat; then, after all these precautions, he chained up his dogs, and
      returned to open the gate to the clerk and masons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil, my good man!&rdquo; said the clerk, as he entered;
      &ldquo;there would not be more formalities in opening the gates of a
      fortress!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew bowed, but without answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you deaf, my good fellow?&rdquo; cried the clerk, close to his
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Samuel, with a quiet smile, as he advanced
      several steps beyond the passage. Then pointing to the old house, he
      added: &ldquo;That, sir, is the door which you will have to open; you will
      also have to remove the lead and iron from the second window to the right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not open all the windows?&rdquo; asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, sir, as guardian of this house, I have received particular
      orders on the subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave you these orders?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, sir, who received them from his father, who transmitted
      them from the master of this house. When I cease to have the care of it,
      the new proprietor will do as he pleases.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; said the clerk, not a little surprised. Then,
      addressing himself to the masons, he added: &ldquo;This is your business,
      my fine fellows; you are to unwall the door, and remove the iron
      frame-work of the second window to the right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the masons set to work, under the inspection of the notary&rsquo;s
      clerk, a coach stopped before the outer gate, and Rodin, accompanied by
      Gabriel, entered the house in the Rue Saint-Francois.

      CHAPTER XIX. THE HEIR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Samuel opened the door to Gabriel and Rodin.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The latter said to the Jew, &ldquo;You, sir, are the keeper of this house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Samuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont,&rdquo; said Rodin, as he
      introduced his companion, &ldquo;one of the descendants of the family of
      the Renneponts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy to hear it, sir,&rdquo; said the Jew, almost involuntarily,
      struck with the angelic countenance of Gabriel&mdash;for nobleness and
      serenity of soul were visible in the glance of the young priest, and were
      written upon his pure, white brow, already crowned with the halo of
      martyrdom. Samuel looked at Gabriel with curiosity and benevolent
      interest; but feeling that this silent contemplation must cause some
      embarrassment to his guest, he said to him, &ldquo;M. Abbe, the notary
      will not be here before ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel looked at him in turn, with an air of surprise, and answered,
      &ldquo;What notary, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny will explain all this to you,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, hastily. Then addressing Samuel, he added, &ldquo;We are a little
      before the time. Will you allow us to wait for the arrival of the notary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Samuel, &ldquo;if you please to walk into my
      house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; answered Rodin, &ldquo;and accept your
      offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me, then, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments after, the young priest and the socius, preceded by Samuel,
      entered one of the rooms occupied by the latter, on the ground-floor of
      the building, looking out upon the court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who has been the guardian of M. Gabriel,
      will soon be coming to ask for us,&rdquo; added Rodin; &ldquo;will you
      have the kindness, sir to show him into this room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail to do so, sir,&rdquo; said Samuel, as he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socius and Gabriel were left alone. To the adorable gentleness which
      usually gave to the fine features of the missionary so touching a charm,
      there had succeeded in this moment a remarkable expression of sadness,
      resolution, and severity. Rodin not having seen Gabriel for some days, was
      greatly struck by the change he remarked in him. He had watched him
      silently all the way from the Rue des Postes to the Rue Saint-Francois.
      The young priest wore, as usual, a long black cassock, which made still
      more visible the transparent paleness of his countenance. When the Jew had
      left the room, Gabriel said to Rodin, in a firm voice, &ldquo;Will you at
      length inform me, sir, why, for some days past, I have been prevented from
      speaking to his reverence Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny? Why has he chosen this
      house to grant me an interview?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to answer these questions,&rdquo; replied
      Rodin, coldly. &ldquo;His reverence will soon arrive, and will listen to
      you. All I can tell you is, that the reverend father lays as much stress
      upon this meeting as you do. If he has chosen this house for the
      interview, it is because you have an interest to be here. You know it well&mdash;though
      you affected astonishment on hearing the guardian speak of a notary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rodin fixed a scrutinizing, anxious look upon Gabriel, whose
      countenance expressed only surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said he, in reply to Rodin. &ldquo;What
      have I to do with this house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible that you should not know it,&rdquo; answered
      Rodin, still looking at him with attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you, sir, that I do not know it,&rdquo; replied the
      other, almost offended by the pertinacity of the socius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, did your adopted mother come to tell you yesterday? Why
      did you presume to receive her without permission from Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      as I have heard this morning? Did she not speak with you of certain family
      papers, found upon you when she took you in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Gabriel; &ldquo;those papers were delivered at
      the time to my adopted mother&rsquo;s confessor, and they afterwards
      passed into Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s hands. This is the first I
      hear for a long time of these papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you affirm that Frances Baudoin did not come to speak to you on
      this subject?&rdquo; resumed Rodin, obstinately, laying great emphasis on
      his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the second time, sir, that you seem to doubt my
      affirmation,&rdquo; said the young priest, mildly, while he repressed a
      movement of impatience, &ldquo;I assure you that I speak the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows nothing,&rdquo; thought Rodin; for he was too well
      convinced of Gabriel&rsquo;s sincerity to retain the least doubt after so
      positive a declaration. &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; went on he. &ldquo;The
      idea only occurred to me in reflecting what could be the reason of
      sufficient weight to induce you to transgress Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      orders with regard to the absolute retirement he had commanded, which was
      to exclude all communication with those without. Much more, contrary to
      all the rules of our house, you ventured to shut the door of your room,
      whereas it ought to remain half open, that the mutual inspection enjoined
      us might be the more easily practiced. I could only explain these sins
      against discipline, by the necessity of some very important conversation
      with your adopted mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to a priest, and not to her adopted son, that Madame Baudoin
      wished to speak,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, in a tone of deep seriousness.
      &ldquo;I closed my door because I was to hear a confession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what had Frances Baudoin of such importance to confess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know that by-and-bye, when I speak to his reverence&mdash;if
      it be his pleasure that you should hear me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were so firmly spoken, that a long silence ensued. Let us
      remind the reader that Gabriel had hitherto been kept by his superiors in
      the most complete ignorance of the importance of the family interests
      which required his presence in the Rue Saint-Francois. The day before,
      Frances Baudoin, absorbed in her own grief, had forgotten to tell him that
      the two orphans also should be present at this meeting, and had she even
      thought of it, Dagobert would have prevented her mentioning this
      circumstance to the young priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel was therefore quite ignorant of the family ties which united him
      with the daughters of Marshal Simon, with Mdlle. de Cardoville, with M.
      Hardy, Prince Djalma, and Sleepinbuff. In a word, if it had then been
      revealed to him that he was the heir of Marius de Rennepont, he would have
      believed himself the only descendant of the family. During the moment&rsquo;s
      silence which succeeded his conversation with Rodin, Gabriel observed
      through the windows the mason&rsquo;s at their work of unwalling the door.
      Having finished this first operation, they set about removing the bars of
      iron by which a plate of lead was fixed over the same entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, conducted by Samuel, entered
      the room. Before Gabriel could turn around, Rodin had time to whisper to
      the reverend father, &ldquo;He knows nothing&mdash;and we have no longer
      anything to fear from the Indian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his affected calmness, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      countenance was pale and contracted, like that of a player who is about to
      stake all on a last, decisive game. Hitherto, all had favored the designs
      of the Society; but he could not think without alarm of the four hours
      which still remained before they should reach the fatal moment. Gabriel
      having turned towards him, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny offered him his hand
      with a smile, and said to him in an affectionate and cordial tone, &ldquo;My
      dear son, it has pained me a good deal to have been obliged to refuse you
      till now the interview that you so much desired. It has been no less
      distressing to me to impose on you a confinement of some days. Though I
      cannot give any explanation of what I may think fit to order, I will just
      observe to you that I have acted only for your interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bound to believe your reverence,&rdquo; answered Gabriel,
      bowing his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, the young priest felt a vague sense of fear, for
      until his departure for his American mission, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, at
      whose feet he had pronounced the formidable vows which bound him
      irrevocably to the Society of Jesus, had exercised over him that frightful
      species of influence which, acting only by despotism, suppression, and
      intimidation, breaks down all the living forces of the soul, and leaves it
      inert, trembling, and terrified. Impressions of early youth are indelible,
      and this was the first time, since his return from America, that Gabriel
      found himself in presence of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny; and although he did
      not shrink from the resolution he had taken, he regretted not to have been
      able, as he had hoped, to gather new strength and courage from an
      interview with Agricola and Dagobert. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny knew mankind
      too well not to have remarked the emotion of the young priest, and to have
      endeavored to explain its cause. This emotion appeared to him a favorable
      omen; he redoubled, therefore, his seductive arts, his air of tenderness
      and amenity, reserving to himself, if necessary, the choice of assuming
      another mask. He sat down, while Gabriel and Rodin remained standing in a
      respectful position, and said to the former: &ldquo;You desire, my dear
      son, to have an important interview with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Gabriel, involuntarily casting down his
      eyes before the large, glittering gray pupil of his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also have matters of great importance to communicate to you.
      Listen to me first; you can speak afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listen, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about twelve years ago, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      affectionately, &ldquo;that the confessor of your adopted mother,
      addressing himself to me through M. Rodin, called my attention to
      yourself, by reporting the astonishing progress you had made at the school
      of the Brothers. I soon found, indeed, that your excellent conduct, your
      gentle, modest character, and your precocious intelligence, were worthy of
      the most tender interest. From that moment I kept my eyes upon you, and at
      the end of some time, seeing that you did not fall off, it appeared to me
      that there was something more in you than the stuff that makes a workman.
      We agreed with your adopted mother, and through my intervention, you were
      admitted gratuitously to one of the schools of our Company. Thus one
      burden the less weighed upon the excellent woman who had taken charge of
      you, and you received from our paternal care all the benefits of a
      religious education. Is not this true, my dear son?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, father,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, casting down his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you grew up, excellent and rare virtues displayed themselves in
      your character. Your obedience and mildness were above all exemplary. You
      made rapid progress in your studies. I knew not then to what career you
      wished to devote yourself, but I felt certain that, in every station of
      life, you would remain a faithful son of the Church. I was not deceived in
      my hopes, or rather, my dear son, you surpassed them all. Learning, by a
      friendly communication, that your adopted mother ardently desired to see
      you take orders, you acceded generously and religiously to the wish of the
      excellent woman to whom you owed so much. But as the Lord is always just
      in His recompenses, He willed that the most touching work of gratitude you
      could show to your adopted mother, should at the same time be divinely
      profitable by making you one of the militant members of our holy Church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Gabriel could not repress a significant start, as he
      remembered Frances&rsquo; sad confidences. But he restrained himself,
      whilst Rodin stood leaning with his elbow on the corner of the
      chimney-piece, continuing to examine him with singular and obstinate
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny resumed: &ldquo;I do not conceal from you, my dear
      son, that your resolution filled me with joy. I saw in you one of the
      future lights of the Church, and I was anxious to see it shine in the
      midst of our Company. You submitted courageously to our painful and
      difficult tests; you were judged worthy of belonging to us, and, after
      taking in my presence the irrevocable and sacred oath, which binds you for
      ever to our Company for the greater glory of God, you answered the appeal
      of our Holy Father(14) to willing souls, and offered yourself as a
      missionary, to preach to savages the one Catholic faith. Though it was
      painful to us to part with our dear son, we could not refuse to accede to
      such pious wishes. You set out a humble missionary you return a glorious
      martyr&mdash;and we are justly proud to reckon you amongst our number.
      This rapid sketch of the past was necessary, my dear son to arrive at what
      follows, for we wish now, if it be possible, to draw still closer the
      bonds that unite us. Listen to me, my dear son; what I am about to say is
      confidential and of the highest importance, not only for you, but the
      whole Company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father,&rdquo; cried Gabriel hastily, interrupting the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I ought not to hear you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young priest became deadly pale; one saw, by the alteration of his
      features, that a violent struggle was taking place within him, but
      recovering his first resolution, he raised his head, and casting an
      assured look on Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin, who glanced at each
      other in mute surprise, he resumed: &ldquo;I repeat to you, father, that
      if it concerns confidential matters of the Company, I must not hear you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear son, you occasion me the greatest astonishment.
      What is the matter?&mdash;Your countenance changes, your emotion is
      visible. Speak without fear; why can you not hear me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you, father, until I also have, in my turn, rapidly
      sketched the past&mdash;such as I have learned to judge it of late. You
      will then understand, father, that I am no longer entitled to your
      confidence, for an abyss will doubtlessly soon separate us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, it is impossible to paint the look rapidly exchanged
      between Rodin and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. The socius began to bite his
      nails, fixing his reptile eye angrily upon Gabriel; Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      grew livid, and his brow was bathed in cold sweat. He asked himself with
      terror, if, at the moment of reaching the goal, the obstacle was going to
      come from Gabriel, in favor of whom all other obstacles had been removed.
      This thought filled him with despair. Yet the reverend father contained
      himself admirably, remained calm, and answered with affectionate unction:
      &ldquo;It is impossible to believe, my dear son, that you and I can ever
      be separated by an abyss&mdash;unless by the abyss of grief, which would
      be caused by any serious danger to your salvation. But speak; I listen to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, that, twelve years ago, father,&rdquo; proceeded
      Gabriel, in a firm voice, growing more animated as he proceeded, &ldquo;I
      entered, through your intervention, a college of the Company of Jesus. I
      entered it loving, truthful, confiding. How did they encourage those
      precious instincts of childhood? I will tell you. The day of my entrance,
      the Superior said to me, as he pointed out two children a little older
      than myself: &lsquo;These are the companions that you will prefer. You
      will always walk three together. The rules of the house forbid all
      intercourse between two persons only. They also require, that you should
      listen attentively to what your companions say, so that you may report it
      to me; for these dear children may have, without knowing it, bad thoughts
      or evil projects. Now, if you love your comrades, you must inform me of
      these evil tendencies, that my paternal remonstrances may save them from
      punishment; it is better to prevent evil than to punish it.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such are, indeed, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;the rules of our house, and the language we hold to all our pupils
      on their entrance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, father,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, bitterly; &ldquo;three
      days after, a poor, submissive, and credulous child, I was already a spy
      upon my comrades, hearing and remembering their conversation, and
      reporting it to the superior, who congratulated me on my zeal. What they
      thus made me do was shameful, and yet, God knows! I thought I was
      accomplishing a charitable duty. I was happy in obeying the commands of a
      superior whom I respected, and to whose words I listened, in my childish
      faith, as I should have listened to those of Heaven. One day, that I had
      broken some rule of the house, the superior said to me: &lsquo;My child,
      you have deserved a severe punishment; but you will be pardoned, if you
      succeed in surprising one of your comrades in the same fault that you have
      committed.&rsquo; And for that, notwithstanding my faith and blind
      obedience, this encouragement to turn informer, from the motive of
      personal interest, might appear odious to me, the superior added. &lsquo;I
      speak to you, my child, for the sake of your comrade&rsquo;s salvation.
      Were he to escape punishment, his evil habits would become habitual. But
      by detecting him in a fault, and exposing him to salutary correction, you
      will have the double advantage of aiding in his salvation, and escaping
      yourself a merited punishment, which will have been remitted because of
      your zeal for your neighbor&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, more and more
      terrified by Gabriel&rsquo;s language; &ldquo;and in truth, my dear son,
      all this is conformable to the rule followed in our colleges, and to the
      habits of the members of our Company, &lsquo;who may denounce each other
      without prejudice to mutual love and charity, and only for their greater
      spiritual advancement, particularly when questioned by their superior, or
      commanded for the greater glory of God,&rsquo; as our Constitution has it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; cried Gabriel; &ldquo;I know it. &lsquo;Tis in
      the name of all that is most sacred amongst men, that we are encouraged to
      do evil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, trying to conceal
      his secret and growing terror beneath an appearance of wounded dignity,
      &ldquo;from you to me these words are at least strange.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Rodin quitted the mantelpiece, on which he had been leaning,
      begin to walk up and down the room, with a meditative air, and without
      ceasing to bite his nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cruel to be obliged to remind you, my dear son, that your are
      indebted to us for the education you have received,&rdquo; added Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such were its fruits, father,&rdquo; replied Gabriel. &ldquo;Until
      then I had been a spy on the other children, from a sort of
      disinterestedness; but the orders of the superior made me advance another
      step on that shameful road. I had become an informer, to escape a merited
      punishment. And yet, such was my faith, my humility, my confidence, that I
      performed with innocence and candor this doubly odious part. Once, indeed,
      tormented by vague scruples, the last remains of generous aspirations that
      they were stifling within me, I asked myself if the charitable and
      religious end could justify the means, and I communicated my doubts to the
      superior. He replied, that I had not to judge, but to obey, and that to
      him alone belonged the responsibility of my acts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, gelding,
      in spite of himself, to the deepest dejection. &ldquo;Alas! I was right in
      opposing your travel to America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it was the will of Providence, in that new, productive, and
      free country, that, enlightened by a singular chance, on past and present,
      my eyes were at length opened. Yes!&rdquo; cried Gabriel, &ldquo;it was in
      America that, released from the gloomy abode where I had spent so many
      years of my youth, and finding myself for the first time face to face with
      the divine majesty of Nature, in the heart of immense solitudes through
      which I journeyed&mdash;it was there that, overcome by so much
      magnificence and grandeur, I made a vow&mdash;&rdquo; Here Gabriel
      interrupted himself, to continue: &ldquo;Presently, father, I will explain
      to you that vow; but believe me,&rdquo; added the missionary, with an
      accent of deep sorrow, &ldquo;it was a fatal day to me when I first
      learned to fear and condemn all that I had hitherto most revered and
      blessed. Oh! I assure you father,&rdquo; added Gabriel, with moist eyes,
      &ldquo;it was not for myself alone, that I then wept.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the goodness of your heart, my dear son,&rdquo; replied
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, catching a glimpse of hope, on seeing Gabriel&rsquo;s
      emotion; &ldquo;I fear that you have been led astray. But trust yourself
      to us, as to your spiritual fathers, and I doubt not we shall confirm your
      faith, so unfortunately shaken, and disperse the darkness which at present
      obscures your sight. Alas, my dear son, in your vain illusions, you have
      mistaken some false glimmer for the pure light of day. But go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny was thus speaking, Rodin stopped, took a
      pocket book from his coat, and wrote down several notes. Gabriel was
      becoming more and more pale and agitated. It required no small courage in
      him, to speak as he was speaking, for, since his journey to America, he
      had learned to estimate the formidable power of the Company. But this
      revelation of the past, looked at from the vantage-ground of a more
      enlightened present, was for the young priest the excuse, or rather the
      cause of the determination he had just signified to his superior, and he
      wished to explain all faithfully, notwithstanding the danger he knowingly
      encountered. He continued therefore, in an agitated voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, father, that the last days of my childhood, that happy
      age of frankness and innocent joy, were spent in an atmosphere of terror,
      suspicion, and restraint. Alas! how could I resign myself to the least
      impulse of confiding trust, when I was recommended to shun the looks of
      him who spoke with me, in order to hide the impression that his words
      might cause&mdash;to conceal whatever I felt, and to observe and listen to
      everything? Thus I reached the age of fifteen; by degrees, the rare visits
      that I was allowed to pay, but always in presence of one of our fathers,
      to my adopted mother and brother, were quite suppressed, so as to shut my
      heart against all soft and tender emotions. Sad and fearful in that large,
      old noiseless, gloomy house, I felt that I became more and more isolated
      from the affections and the freedom of the world. My time was divided
      between mutilated studies, without connection and without object, and long
      hours of minute devotional exercises. I ask you, father, did they ever
      seek to warm our young souls by words of tenderness or evangelic love?
      Alas, no! For the words of the divine Saviour&mdash;Love ye one another,
      they had substituted the command: Suspect ye one another. Did they ever,
      father, speak to us of our country or of liberty?&mdash;No! ah, no! for
      those words make the heart beat high; and with them, the heart must not
      beat at all. To our long hours of study and devotion, there only succeeded
      a few walks, three by three&mdash;never two and two&mdash;because by
      threes, the spy-system is more practicable, and because intimacies are
      more easily formed by two alone; and thus might have arisen some of those
      generous friendships, which also make the heart beat more than it
      should.15 And so, by the habitual repression of every feeling, there came
      a time when I could not feel at all. For six months, I had not seen my
      adopted mother and brother; they came to visit me at the college; a few
      years before, I should have received them with transports and tears; this
      time my eyes were dry, my heart was cold. My mother and brother quitted me
      weeping. The sight of this grief struck me and I became conscious of the
      icy insensibility which had been creeping upon me since I inhabited this
      tomb. Frightened at myself, I wished to leave it, while I had still
      strength to do so. Then, father, I spoke to you of the choice of a
      profession; for sometimes, in waking moments, I seemed to catch from afar
      the sound of an active and useful life, laborious and free, surrounded by
      family affections. Oh! then I felt the want of movement and liberty, of
      noble and warm emotions&mdash;of that life of the soul, which fled before
      me. I told it you, father on my knees, bathing your hands with my tears.
      The life of a workman or a soldier&mdash;anything would have suited me. It
      was then you informed me, that my adopted mother, to whom I owed my life&mdash;for
      she had taken me in, dying of want, and, poor herself, had shared with me
      the scanty bread of her child&mdash;admirable sacrifice for a mother!&mdash;that
      she,&rdquo; continued Gabriel, hesitating and casting down his eyes, for
      noble natures blush for the guilt of others, and are ashamed of the
      infamies of which they are themselves victims, &ldquo;that she, that my
      adopted mother, had but one wish, one desire&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of seeing you takes orders, my dear son,&rdquo; replied Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny; &ldquo;for this pious and perfect creature hoped, that,
      in securing your salvation, she would provide for her own: but she did not
      venture to inform you of this thought, for fear you might ascribe it to an
      interested motive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, father!&rdquo; said Gabriel, interrupting the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a movement of involuntary indignation; &ldquo;it is painful for me to
      hear you assert an error. Frances Baudoin never had such a thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son, you are too hasty in your judgments,&rdquo; replied
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, mildly. &ldquo;I tell you, that such was the one,
      sole thought of your adopted mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, father, she told me all. She and I were equally
      deceived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, sternly,
      &ldquo;you take the word of your adopted mother before mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me an answer painful for both of us, father,&rdquo; said
      Gabriel, casting down his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you now tell me,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with
      anxiety, &ldquo;what you mean to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend father was unable to finish. Samuel entered the room, and
      said: &ldquo;A rather old man wishes to speak to M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name, sir,&rdquo; answered the socius, in surprise;
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you.&rdquo; But, before following the Jew, he
      gave to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny a few words written with a pencil upon one
      of the leaves of his packet-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin went out in very uneasy mood, to learn who could have come to seek
      him in the Rue Saint-Francois. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Gabriel were
      left alone together.
    </p>

      papal supremacy.

    <p>
      (15) This rule is so strict in Jesuit Colleges, that if one of three
      pupils leaves the other two, they separate out of earshot till the first
      comes back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE RUPTURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>lunged into a
      state of mortal anxiety, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had taken mechanically
      the note written by Rodin, and held it in his hand without thinking of
      opening it. The reverend father asked himself in alarm, what conclusion
      Gabriel would draw from these recriminations upon the past; and he durst
      not make any answer to his reproaches, for fear of irritating the young
      priest, upon whose head such immense interests now reposed. Gabriel could
      possess nothing for himself, according to the constitutions of the Society
      of Jesus. Moreover, the reverend father had obtained from him, in favor of
      the Order, an express renunciation of all property that might ever come to
      him. But the commencement of his conversation seemed to announce so
      serious a change in Gabriel&rsquo;s views with regard to the Company, that
      he might choose to break through the ties which attached him to it; and in
      that case, he would not be legally bound to fulfil any of his
      engagements.(16) The donation would thus be cancelled de facto, just at
      the moment of being so marvellously realized by the possession of the
      immense fortune of the Rennepont family, and d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      hopes would thus be completely and for ever frustrated. Of all these
      perplexities which the reverend father had experienced for some time past,
      with regard to this inheritance, none had been more unexpected and
      terrible than this. Fearing to interrupt or question Gabriel, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      waited, in mute terror, the end of this interview, which already bore so
      threatening an aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary resumed: &ldquo;It is my duty, father, to continue this
      sketch of my past life, until the moment of my departure for America. You
      will understand, presently, why I have imposed on myself this obligation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny nodded for him to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once informed of the pretended wishes of my adopted mother, I
      resigned myself to them, though at some cost of feeling. I left the gloomy
      abode, in which I had passed my childhood and part of my youth, to enter
      one of the seminaries of the Company. My resolution was not caused by an
      irresistible religious vocation, but by a wish to discharge the sacred
      debt I owed my adopted mother. Yet the true spirit of the religion of
      Christ is so vivifying, that I felt myself animated and warmed by the idea
      of carrying out the adorable precepts of our Blessed Saviour. To my
      imagination, a seminary, instead of resembling the college where I had
      lived in painful restraint, appeared like a holy place, where all that was
      pure and warm in the fraternity of the Gospel would be applied to common
      life&mdash;where, for example, the lessons most frequently taught would be
      the ardent love of humanity, and the ineffable sweets of commiseration and
      tolerance&mdash;where the everlasting words of Christ would be interpreted
      in their broadest sense&mdash;and where, in fine, by the habitual exercise
      and expansion of the most generous sentiments, men were prepared for the
      magnificent apostolic mission of making the rich and happy sympathize with
      the sufferings of their brethren, by unveiling the frightful miseries of
      humanity&mdash;a sublime and sacred morality, which none are able to
      withstand, when it is preached with eyes full of tears, and hearts
      overflowing with tenderness and charity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he delivered these last words with profound emotion, Gabriel&rsquo;s
      eyes became moist, and his countenance shone with angelic beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is, indeed, my dear son, the spirit of Christianity; but one
      must also study and explain the letter,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      coldly. &ldquo;It is to this study that the seminaries of our Company are
      specially destined. Now the interpretation of the letter is a work of
      analysis, discipline, and submission&mdash;and not one of heart and
      sentiment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive that only too well, father. On entering this new house,
      I found, alas! all my hopes defeated. Dilating for a moment, my heart soon
      sunk within me. Instead of this centre of life, affection, youth, of which
      I had dreamed. I found, in the silent and ice-cold seminary, the same
      suppression of every generous emotion, the same inexorable discipline, the
      same system of mutual prying, the same suspicion, the same invincible
      obstacles to all ties of friendship. The ardor which had warmed my soul
      for an instant soon died out; little by little, I fell back into the
      habits of a stagnant, passive, mechanical life, governed by a pitiless
      power with mechanical precision, just like the inanimate works of a watch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But order, submission and regularity are the first foundations of
      our Company, my dear son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, father! it was death, not life, that I found thus organized.
      In the midst of this destruction of every generous principle, I devoted
      myself to scholastic and theological studies&mdash;gloomy studies&mdash;a
      wily, menacing, and hostile science which, always awake to ideas of peril,
      contest, and war, is opposed to all those of peace, progress, and liberty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theology, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      sternly, &ldquo;is at once a buckler and a sword; a buckler, to protect
      and cover the Catholic faith&mdash;a sword, to attack and combat heresy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, father, Christ and His apostles knew not this subtle
      science: their simple and touching words regenerated mankind, and set
      freedom over slavery. Does not the divine code of the Gospel suffice to
      teach men to love one another? But, alas! far from speaking to us this
      language, our attention was too often occupied with wars of religion, and
      the rivers of blood that had flowed in honor of the Lord, and for the
      destruction of heresy. These terrible lessons made our life still more
      melancholy. As we grew near to manhood, our relations at the seminary
      assumed a growing character of bitterness, jealousy and suspicion. The
      habit of tale bearing against each other, applied to more serious
      subjects, engendered silent hate and profound resentments. I was neither
      better nor worse than the others. All of us, bowed down for years beneath
      the iron yoke of passive obedience, unaccustomed to reflection or
      free-will, humble and trembling before our superiors, had the same pale,
      dull, colorless disposition. At last I took orders; once a priest, you
      invited me, father, to enter the Company of Jesus, or rather I found
      myself insensibly brought to this determination. How, I do not know. For a
      long time before, my will was not my own. I went through all my proofs;
      the most terrible was decisive; for some months, I lived in the silence of
      my cell, practicing with resignation the strange and mechanical exercises
      that you ordered me. With the exception of your reverence, nobody
      approached me during that long space of time; no human voice but yours
      sounded in my ear. Sometimes, in the night, I felt vague terrors; my mind,
      weakened by fasting, austerity, and solitude, was impressed with frightful
      visions. At other times, on the contrary, I felt a sort of quiescence, in
      the idea that, having once pronounced my vows, I should be delivered for
      ever from the burden of thought and will. Then I abandoned myself to an
      insurmountable torpor, like those unfortunate wretches, who, surprised by
      a snow-storm, yield to a suicidal repose. Thus I awaited the fatal moment.
      At last, according to the rule of discipline, choking with the death
      rattle,(17) I hastened the moment of accomplishing the final act of my
      expiring will&mdash;the vow to renounce it for ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, my dear son,&rdquo; replied Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, pale
      and tortured by increasing anguish, &ldquo;remember, that, on the eve of
      the day fixed for the completion of your vows; I offered, according to the
      rule of our Company, to absolve you from joining us&mdash;leaving you
      completely free, for we accept none but voluntary vocations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, father,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, with sorrowful
      bitterness; &ldquo;when, worn out and broken by three months of solitude
      and trial, I was completely exhausted, and unable to move a step, you
      opened the door of my cell, and said to me: &lsquo;If you like, rise and
      walk; you are free; Alas! I had no more strength. The only desire of my
      soul, inert and paralyzed for so long a period, was the repose of the
      grave; and pronouncing those irrevocable vows, I fell, like a corpse, into
      your hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, till now, my dear son, you have never failed in this corpse&mdash;like
      obedience,&mdash;to use the expression of our glorious founder&mdash;because,
      the more absolute this obedience, the more meritorious it must be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Gabriel resumed: &ldquo;You had always
      concealed from me, father, the true ends of the Society into which I
      entered. I was asked to abandon my free-will to my superiors, in the name
      of the Greater Glory of God. My vows once pronounced, I was to be in your
      hands a docile and obedient instrument; but I was to be employed, you told
      me, in a holy, great and beauteous work. I believed you, father&mdash;how
      should I not have believed you? but a fatal event changed my destiny&mdash;a
      painful malady caused by&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, interrupting Gabriel,
      &ldquo;it is useless to recall these circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, father, I must recall them. I have the right to be
      heard. I cannot pass over in silence any of the facts, which have led me
      to take the immutable resolution that I am about to announce to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak on, my son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, frowning;
      for he was much alarmed at the words of the young priest, whose cheeks,
      until now pale, were covered with a deep blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six months before my departure for America,&rdquo; resumed Gabriel,
      casting down his eyes, &ldquo;you informed me, that I was destined to
      confess penitents; and to prepare then for that sacred ministry, you gave
      me a book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel again hesitated. His blushes increased. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      could scarcely restrain a start of impatience and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me a book,&rdquo; resumed the young priest, with a great
      effort to control himself, &ldquo;a book containing questions to be
      addressed by a confessor to youths, and young girls, and married women,
      when they present themselves at the tribunal of penance. My God!&rdquo;
      added Gabriel, shuddering at the remembrance. &ldquo;I shall never forget
      that awful moment. It was night. I had retired to my chamber, taking with
      me this book, composed, you told me, by one of our fathers, and completed
      by a holy bishop.(18) Full of respect, faith, and confidence, I opened
      those pages. At first, I did not understand them&mdash;afterwards I
      understood&mdash;and then I was seized with shame and horror&mdash;struck
      with stupor&mdash;and had hardly strength to close, with trembling hand,
      this abominable volume. I ran to you, father, to accuse myself of having
      involuntarily cast my eyes on those nameless pages, which, by mistake, you
      had placed in my hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, also, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      gravely, &ldquo;that I calmed your scruples, and told you that a priest,
      who is bound to hear everything under the seal of confession, must be able
      to know and appreciate everything; and that our Company imposes the task
      of reading this Compendium, as a classical work, upon young deacons
      seminarists, and priests, who are destined to be confessors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believed you, father. In me the habit of inert obedience was so
      powerful, and I was so unaccustomed to independent reflection, that,
      notwithstanding my horror (with which I now reproached myself as with a
      crime), I took the volume back into my chamber, and read. Oh, father! what
      a dreadful revelation of criminal fancies, guilty of guiltiest in their
      refinement!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of this book in blamable terms,&rdquo; skid Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      severely; &ldquo;you were the victim of a too lively imagination. It is to
      it that you must attribute this fatal impression, and not to an excellent
      work, irreproachable for its special purpose, and duly authorized by the
      Church. You are not able to judge of such a production.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak of it no more, father,&rdquo; said Gabriel: and he
      thus resumed: &ldquo;A long illness followed that terrible night. Many
      times, they feared for my reason. When I recovered, the past appeared to
      me like a painful dream. You told me, then, father, that I was not yet
      ripe for certain functions; and it was then that I earnestly entreated you
      to be allowed to go on the American missions. After having long refused my
      prayer, you at length consented. From my childhood, I had always lived in
      the college or seminary, to a state of continual restraint and subjection.
      By constantly holding down my head and eyes, I had lost the habit of
      contemplating the heavens and the splendors of nature. But, oh! what deep,
      religious happiness I felt, when I found myself suddenly transported to
      the centre of the imposing grandeur of the seas-half-way between the ocean
      and the sky!&mdash;I seemed to come forth from a place of thick darkness;
      for the first time, for many years, I felt my heart beat freely in my
      bosom; for the first time, I felt myself master of my own thoughts, and
      ventured to examine my past life, as from the summit of a mountain, one
      looks down into a gloomy vale. Then strange doubts rose within me. I asked
      myself by what right, and for what end, any beings had so long repressed,
      almost annihilated, the exercise of my will, of my liberty, of my reason,
      since God had endowed me with these gifts. But I said to myself, that
      perhaps, one day, the great, beauteous, and holy work, in which I was to
      have my share, would be revealed to me, and would recompense my obedience
      and resignation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Rodin re-entered the room. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      questioned him with a significant look. The socius approached, and said to
      him in a low voice, so, that Gabriel could not hear: &ldquo;Nothing
      serious. It was only to inform me, that Marshal Simon&rsquo;s father is
      arrived at M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, glancing at Gabriel, Rodin appeared to interrogate Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      who hung his head with a desponding air. Yet he resumed, again addressing
      Gabriel, whilst Rodin took his old place, with his elbow on the
      chimney-piece: &ldquo;Go on, my dear son. I am anxious to learn what
      resolution you have adopted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you in a moment, father. I arrived at Charleston. The
      superior of our establishment in that place, to whom I imparted my doubts
      as to the object of our Society, took upon himself to clear them up, and
      unveiled it all to me with alarming frankness. He told me the tendency not
      perhaps of all the members of the Company, for a great number must have
      shared my ignorance&mdash;but the objects which our leaders have
      pertinaciously kept in view, ever since the foundation of the Order. I was
      terrified. I read the casuists. Oh, father! that was a new and dreadful
      revelation, when, at every page, I read the excuse and justification of
      robbery, slander, adultery, perjury, murder, regicide. When I considered
      that I, the priest of a God of charity, justice, pardon, and love, was to
      belong henceforth to a Company, whose chiefs professed and glorified in
      such doctrines, I made a solemn oath to break for ever the ties which
      bound me to it!&rdquo;(19)
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words of Gabriel, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin exchanged a
      look of terror. All was lost; their prey had escaped them. Deeply moved by
      the remembrances he recalled, Gabriel did not perceive the action of the
      reverend father and the socius, and thus continued: &ldquo;In spite of my
      resolution, father, to quit the Company, the discovery I had made was very
      painful to me. Oh! believe me, for the honest and loving soul, nothing is
      more frightful than to have to renounce what it has long respected!&mdash;I
      suffered so much, that, when I thought of the dangers of my mission, I
      hoped, with a secret joy, that God would perhaps take me to Himself under
      these circumstances: but, on the contrary, He watched over me with
      providential solicitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, Gabriel felt a thrill, for he remembered a Mysterious
      Woman who had saved his life in America. After a moment&rsquo;s silence,
      he resumed: &ldquo;My mission terminated, I returned hither to beg,
      father, that you would release me from my vows. Many times but in vain, I
      solicited an interview. Yesterday, it pleased Providence that I should
      have a long conversation with my adopted mother; from her I learned the
      trick by which my vocation had been forced upon me&mdash;and the
      sacrilegious abuse of the confessional, by which she had been induced to
      entrust to other persons the orphans that a dying mother had confided to
      the care of an honest soldier. You understand, father, that, if even I had
      before hesitated to break these bonds, what I have heard yesterday must
      have rendered my decision irrevocable. But at this solemn moment, father,
      I am bound to tell you, that I do not accuse the whole Society; many
      simple, credulous, and confiding men, like myself, must no doubt form part
      of it. Docile instruments, they see not in their blindness the work to
      which they are destined. I pity them, and pray God to enlighten them, as
      he has enlightened me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, rising with livid
      and despairing look, &ldquo;you come to ask of me to break the ties which
      attach you to the Society?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; you received my vows&mdash;it is for you to release me
      from them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my son, you understand that engagements once freely taken by
      you, are now to be considered as null and void?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my son, there is to be henceforth nothing in common between you
      and our Company?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father&mdash;since I request you to absolve me of my vows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you know, my son, that the Society may release you&mdash;but
      that you cannot release yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The step I take proves to you, father, the importance I attach to
      an oath, since I come to you to release me from it. Nevertheless, were you
      to refuse me, I should not think myself bound in the eyes of God or man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly clear,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to
      Rodin, his voice expiring upon his lips, so deep was his despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, whilst Gabriel, with downcast eyes, waited for the answer of
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who remained mute and motionless, Rodin appeared
      struck with a new idea, on perceiving that the reverend father still held
      in his hand the note written in pencil. The socius hastily approached
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and said to him in a whisper, with a look of
      doubt and alarm: &ldquo;Have you not read my note?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think of it,&rdquo; answered the reverend father,
      mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin appeared to make a great effort to repress a movement of violent
      rage. Then he said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in a calm voice: &ldquo;Read
      it now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the reverend father cast his eyes upon this note, than a sudden
      ray of hope illumined his hitherto despairing countenance. Pressing the
      hand of the socius with an expression of deep gratitude, he said to him in
      a low voice: &ldquo;You are right. Gabriel is ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (16) The statutes formally state that the Company can expel all drones and
      wasps, but that no man can break his ties, if the Order wishes to retain
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (17) This is their own command. The constitution expressly bids the novice
      wait for this decisive climax of the ordeal before taking the vows of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      (18) It is impossible, even in Latin, to give our readers an idea of this
      infamous work.
    </p>
    <p>
      (19) This is true. See the extracts from the Compendium for the use of
      Schools, published under the title of &ldquo;Discoveries by a
      Bibliophilist.&rdquo; Strasburg, 1843. For regicide, see Sanchez and
      others.

      CHAPTER XXI. THE CHANGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>efore again
      addressing Gabriel, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny carefully reflected; and his
      countenance, lately so disturbed, became gradually once more serene. He
      appeared to meditate and calculate the effects of the eloquence he was
      about to employ, upon an excellent and safe theme, which the socius struck
      with the danger of the situation, had suggested in a few lines rapidly
      written with a pencil, and which, in his despair, the reverend father had
      at first neglected. Rodin resumed his post of observation near the
      mantelpiece, on which he leaned his elbow, after casting at Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      a glance of disdainful and angry superiority, accompanied by a significant
      shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this involuntary manifestation, which was luckily not perceived by
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, the cadaverous face of the socius resumed its icy
      calmness, and his flabby eyelids, raised a moment with anger and
      impatience, fell, and half-veiled his little, dull eyes. It must be
      confessed that Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, notwithstanding the ease and
      elegance of his speech, notwithstanding the seduction of his exquisite
      manners, his agreeable features, and the exterior of an accomplished and
      refined man of the world, was often subdued and governed by the unpitying
      firmness, the diabolical craft and depth of Rodin, the old, repulsive,
      dirty, miserably dressed man, who seldom abandoned his humble part of
      secretary and mute auditor. The influence of education is so powerful,
      that Gabriel, notwithstanding the formal rupture he had just provoked,
      felt himself still intimidated in presence of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and
      waited with painful anxiety for the answer of the reverend father to his
      express demand to be released from his old vows. His reverence having,
      doubtless, regularly laid his plan of attack, at length broke silence,
      heaved a deep sigh, gave to his countenance, lately so severe and
      irritated, a touching expression of kindness, and said to Gabriel, in an
      affectionate voice: &ldquo;Forgive me, my dear son, for having kept
      silence so long; but your abrupt determination has so stunned me, and has
      raised within me so many painful thoughts, that I have had to reflect for
      some moments, to try and penetrate the cause of this rupture, and I think
      I have succeeded. You have well considered, my dear son, the serious
      nature of the step you are taking?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have absolutely decided to abandon the Society, even
      against my will?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be painful to me, father&mdash;but I must resign myself to
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should be very painful to you, indeed, my dear son; for you took
      the irrevocable vow freely, and this vow, according to our statutes, binds
      you not to quit the Society, unless with the consent of your superiors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not then know, father, the nature of the engagement I took.
      More enlightened now, I ask to withdraw myself; my only desire is to
      obtain a curacy in some village far from Paris. I feel an irresistible
      vocation for such humble and useful functions. In the country, there is so
      much misery, and such ignorance of all that could contribute to ameliorate
      the condition of the agricultural laborer, that his existence is as
      unhappy as that of a negro slave; for what liberty has he? and what
      instruction? Oh! it seems to me, that, with God&rsquo;s help, I might, as
      a village curate, render some services to humanity. It would therefore be
      painful to me, father, to see you refuse&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, my son,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;I will no longer seek to combat your desire to separate yourself
      from us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father, you release me from my vows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the power to do so, my dear son; but I will write
      immediately to Rome, to ask the necessary authority from our general.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon, my dear son, you will be delivered from these bonds, which
      you deem so heavy; and the men you abandon will not the less continue to
      pray for you, that God may preserve you from still greater wanderings. You
      think yourself released with regard to us, my dear son; but we do not
      think ourselves released with regard to you. It is not thus that we can
      get rid of the habit of paternal attachment. What would you have? We look
      upon ourselves as bound to our children, by the very benefits with which
      we have loaded them. You were poor, and an orphan; we stretched out our
      arms to you, as much from the interest which you deserved, my dear son, as
      to spare your excellent adopted mother too great a burden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Gabriel, with suppressed emotion, &ldquo;I am
      not ungrateful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to believe so, my dear son. For long years, we gave to you,
      as to our beloved child, food for the body and the soul. It pleases you
      now to renounce and abandon us. Not only do we consent to it&mdash;but now
      that I have penetrated the true motives of your rupture with us, it is my
      duty to release you from your vow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what motives do you speak, Father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my dear son, I understand your fears. Dangers menace us&mdash;you
      know it well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangers, father?&rdquo; cried Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, my dear son, that you should not be aware that,
      since the fall of our legitimate sovereigns, our natural protectors,
      revolutionary impiety becomes daily more and more threatening. We are
      oppressed with persecutions. I can, therefore, comprehend and appreciate,
      my dear son, the motive which under such circumstances, induces you to
      separate from us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Gabriel, with as much indignation as grief,
      &ldquo;you do not think that of me&mdash;you cannot think it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without noticing the protestations of Gabriel, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      continued his imaginary picture of the dangers of the Company, which, far
      from being really in peril, was already beginning secretly to recover its
      influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if our Company were now as powerful as it was some years ago,&rdquo;
      resumed the reverend father; &ldquo;if it were still surrounded by the
      respect and homage which are due to it from all true believers&mdash;in
      spite of the abominable calumnies with which we are assailed&mdash;then,
      my dear son, we should perhaps have hesitated to release you from your
      vows, and have rather endeavored to open your eyes to the light, and save
      you from the fatal delusion to which you are a prey. But now that we are
      weak, oppressed, threatened on every side, it is our duty, it is an act of
      charity, not to force you to share in perils from which you have the
      prudence to wish to withdraw yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, saying, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny cast a rapid glance at his socius, who
      answered with a nod of approbation, accompanied by a movement of
      impatience that seemed to say: &ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel was quite overcome. There was not in the whole world a heart more
      generous, loyal, and brave than his. We may judge of what he must have
      suffered, on hearing the resolution he had come to thus misinterpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he resumed, in an agitated voice, whilst his eyes
      filled with tears, &ldquo;your words are cruel and unjust. You know that I
      am not a coward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rodin, in his sharp, cutting voice, addressing
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and pointing to Gabriel with a disdainful look;
      &ldquo;your dear son is only prudent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words from Rodin made Gabriel start; a slight blush colored his pale
      cheeks; his large and blue eyes sparkled with a generous anger; then,
      faithful to the precepts of Christian humility and resignation, he
      conquered this irritable impulse, hung down his head, and, too much
      agitated to reply, remained silent, and brushed away an unseen tear. This
      tear did not escape the notice of the socius. He saw in it no doubt, a
      favorable symptom, for he exchanged a glance of satisfaction with Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      The latter was about to touch on a question of great interest, so,
      notwithstanding his self-command, his voice trembled slightly; but
      encouraged, or rather pushed on by a look from Rodin, who had become
      extremely attentive, he said to Gabriel: &ldquo;Another motive obliges us
      not to hesitate in releasing you from your vow, my dear son. It is a
      question of pure delicacy. You probably learned yesterday from your
      adopted mother, that you will perhaps be called upon to take possession of
      an inheritance, of which the value is unknown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel raised his head hastily and said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
      &ldquo;As I have already stated to M. Rodin, my adopted mother only talked
      of her scruples of conscience, and I was completely ignorant of the
      existence of the inheritance of which you speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of indifference with which the young priest pronounced
      these last words, was remarked by Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;You were
      not aware of it&mdash;I believe you&mdash;though all appearances would
      tend to prove the contrary&mdash;to prove, indeed, that the knowledge of
      this inheritance was not unconnected with your resolution to separate from
      us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, Father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very simple. Your rupture with us would then have two
      motives. First, we are in danger, and you think it prudent to leave us&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to finish, my dear son, and come to the second motive. If
      I am deceived, you can tell me so. These are the facts. Formerly, on the
      hypothesis that your family, of which you knew nothing, might one day
      leave you some property, you made, in return for the care bestowed on you
      by the Company, a free gift of all you might hereafter possess, not to us&mdash;but
      to the poor, of whom we are the born shepherds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father?&rdquo; asked Gabriel, not seeing to what this
      preamble tended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear son&mdash;now that you are sure of enjoying a
      competence, you wish, no doubt, by separating from us, to annul this
      donation made under other circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak plainly, you violate your oath, because we are persecuted,
      and because you wish to take back your gifts,&rdquo; added Rodin, in a
      sharp voice, as if to describe in the clearest and plainest manner the
      situation of Gabriel with regard to the Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this infamous accusation, Gabriel could only raise his hands and eyes
      to heaven, and exclaim, with an expression of despair, &ldquo;Oh, heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more exchanging a look of intelligence with Rodin, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      said to him, in a severe tone, as if reproaching him for his too savage
      frankness: &ldquo;I think you go too far. Our dear son could only have
      acted in the base and cowardly manner you suggest, had he known his
      position as an heir; but, since he affirms the contrary, we are bound to
      believe him&mdash;in spite of appearances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Gabriel, pale, agitated trembling, and with
      half suppressed grief and indignation, &ldquo;I thank you, at least, for
      having suspended your judgment. No, I am not a coward; for heaven is my
      witness, that I knew of no danger to which the Society was exposed. Nor am
      I base and avaricious; for heaven is also my witness, that only at this
      moment I learn from you, father, that I may be destined to inherit
      property, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word, my dear son. It is quite lately that I became informed of
      this circumstance, by the greatest chance in the world,&rdquo; said Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny, interrupting Gabriel; &ldquo;and that was thanks to some
      family papers which your adopted mother had given to her confessor, and
      which were entrusted to us when you entered our college. A little before
      your return from America, in arranging the archives of the Company, your
      file of papers fell into the hands of our father-attorney. It was
      examined, and we thus learned that one of your paternal ancestors, to whom
      the house in which we now are belonged, left a will which is to be opened
      to day at noon. Yesterday, we believed you one of us; our statutes command
      that we should possess nothing of our own; you had corroborated those
      statutes, by a donation in favor of the patrimony of the poor&mdash;which
      we administer. It was no longer you, therefore, but the Company, which, in
      my person, presented itself as the inheritor in your place, furnished with
      your titles, which I have here ready in order. But now, my clear son, that
      you separate from us, you must present yourself in your own name. We came
      here as the representatives of the poor, to whom in former days you
      piously abandoned whatever goods might fall to your share. Now, on the
      contrary, the hope of a fortune changes your sentiments. You are free to
      resume your gifts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel had listened to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny with painful impatience.
      At length he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you mean to say, father, that you think
      me capable of canceling a donation freely made, in favor of the Company,
      to which I am indebted for my education? You believe me infamous enough to
      break my word, in the hope of possessing a modest patrimony?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This patrimony, my dear, son, may be small; but it may also be
      considerable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father! if it were a king&rsquo;s fortune,&rdquo; cried
      Gabriel, with proud and noble indifference, &ldquo;I should not speak
      otherwise&mdash;and I have, I think, the right to be believed listen to my
      fixed resolution. The Company to which I belong runs, you say, great
      dangers. I will inquire into these dangers. Should they prove threatening&mdash;strong
      in the determination which morally separates me from you&mdash;I will not
      leave you till I see the end of your perils. As for the inheritance, of
      which you believe me so desirous, I resign it to you formally, father, as
      I once freely promised. My only wish is, that this property may be
      employed for the relief of the poor. I do not know what may be the amount
      of this fortune, but large or small, it belongs to the Company, because I
      have thereto pledged my word. I have told you, father, that my chief
      desire is to obtain a humble curacy in some poor village&mdash;poor, above
      all&mdash;because there my services will be most useful. Thus, father,
      when a man, who never spoke falsehood in his life, affirms to you, that he
      only sighs for so humble an existence, you ought, I think, to believe him
      incapable of snatching back, from motives of avarice, gifts already made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had now as much trouble to restrain his joy, as he
      before had to conceal his terror. He appeared, however, tolerably calm,
      and said to Gabriel: &ldquo;I did not expect less from you, my dear son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he made a sign to Rodin, to invite him to interpose. The latter
      perfectly understood his superior. He left the chimney, drew near to
      Gabriel, and leaned against the table, upon which stood paper and
      inkstand. Then, beginning mechanically to beat the tattoo with the tips of
      his coarse fingers, in all their array of flat and dirty nails, he said to
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: &ldquo;All this is very fine! but your dear son
      gives you no security for the fulfilment of his promise except an oath&mdash;and
      that, we know, is of little value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried Gabriel
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; said Rodin, coldly. &ldquo;The law does not
      acknowledge our existence and therefore can take no cognizance of
      donations made in favor of the Company. You might resume to-morrow what
      you are pleased to give us to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my oath, sir!&rdquo; cried Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked at him fixedly, as he answered: &ldquo;Your oath? Did you not
      swear eternal obedience to the Company, and never to separate from us?&mdash;and
      of what weight now are these oaths?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Gabriel was embarrassed; but, feeling how false was this
      logic, he rose, calm and dignified, went to seat himself at the desk, took
      up a pen, and wrote as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before God, who sees and hears me, and in the presence of you,
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and M. Rodin, I renew and confirm, freely and
      voluntarily, the absolute donation made by me to the Society of Jesus, in
      the person of the said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, of all the property which
      may hereafter belong to me, whatever may be its value. I swear, on pain of
      infamy, to perform tis irrevocable promise, whose accomplishment I regard,
      in my soul and conscience, as the discharge of a debt, and the fulfilment
      of a pious duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This donation having for its object the acknowledgment of past
      services, and the relief of the poor, no future occurrences can at all
      modify it. For the very reason that I know I could one day legally cancel
      the present free and deliberate act, I declare, that if ever I were to
      attempt such a thing, under any possible circumstances, I should deserve
      the contempt and horror of all honest people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In witness whereof I have written this paper, on the 13th of
      February, 1832, in Paris, immediately before the opening of the testament
      of one of my paternal ancestors.

    <p>
      &ldquo;GABRIEL DE RENNEPONT.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose, the young priest delivered this document to Rodin, without
      uttering a word. The socius read it attentively, and, still impassible,
      answered, as he looked at Gabriel: &ldquo;Well, it is a written oath&mdash;that
      is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel dwelt stupefied at the audacity of Rodin, who ventured to tell
      him, that this document, in which he renewed his donation in so noble,
      generous, and spontaneous a manner, was not all sufficient. The socius was
      the first again to break the silence, and he said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with his usual cool impudence. &ldquo;One of two things must be. Either
      your dear son means to render his donation absolutely valuable and
      irrevocable,&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Gabriel, interrupting him, and hardly able to
      restrain himself, &ldquo;spare yourself and me such a shameful
      supposition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, impassible as ever, &ldquo;as you
      are perfectly decided to make this donation a serious reality, what
      objection can you have to secure it legally?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, sir,&rdquo; said Gabriel, bitterly, &ldquo;since my written
      and sworn promise will not suffice you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, affectionately,
      &ldquo;if this were a donation for my own advantage, believe me I should
      require no better security than your word. But here I am, as it were, the
      agent of the Society, or rather the trustee of the poor, who will profit
      by your generosity. For the sake of humanity, therefore, we cannot secure
      this gift by too many legal precautions, so that the unfortunate objects
      of our care may have certainty instead of vague hopes to depend upon. God
      may call you to him at any moment, and who shall say that your heirs will
      be so ready to keep the oath you have taken?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, father,&rdquo; said Gabriel, sadly; &ldquo;I had not
      thought of the case of death, which is yet so probable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon, Samuel opened the door of the room, and said: &ldquo;Gentlemen,
      the notary has just arrived. Shall I show him in? At ten o&rsquo;clock
      precisely, the door of the house will be opened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are the more glad to see the notary,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;as
      we just happen to have some business with him. Pray ask him to walk in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring him to you instantly,&rdquo; replied Samuel, as he
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a notary,&rdquo; said Rodin to Gabriel. &ldquo;If you have
      still the same intentions, you can legalize your donation in presence of
      this public officer, and thus save yourself from a great burden for the
      future.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Gabriel, &ldquo;happen what may, I am as
      irrevocably engaged by this written promise, which I beg you to keep,
      father&rdquo;&mdash;and he handed the paper to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      &ldquo;as by the legal document, which I am about to sign,&rdquo; he
      added, turning to Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, my dear son,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny; &ldquo;here
      is the notary,&rdquo; just as the latter entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the interview of the administrative officer with Rodin, Gabriel,
      and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, we shall conduct the reader to the interior
      of the walled-up house.

      CHAPTER XXII. THE RED ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s Samuel had said,
      the door of the walled-up house had just been disencumbered of the bricks,
      lead, and iron, which had kept it from view, and its panels of carved oak
      appeared as fresh and sound, as on the day when they had first been
      withdrawn from the influence of the air and time. The laborers, having
      completed their work, stood waiting upon the steps, as impatient and
      curious as the notary&rsquo;s clerk, who had superintended the operation,
      when they saw Samuel slowly advancing across the garden, with a great
      bunch of keys in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my friends,&rdquo; said the old man, when he had reached the
      steps, &ldquo;your work is finished. The master of this gentleman will pay
      you, and I have only to show you out by the street door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my good fellow,&rdquo; cried the clerk, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      think. We are just at the most interesting and curious moment; I and these
      honest masons are burning to see the interior of this mysterious house,
      and you would be cruel enough to send us away? Impossible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret the necessity, sir, but so it must he. I must be the first
      to enter this dwelling, absolutely alone, before introducing the heirs, in
      order to read the testament.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who gave you such ridiculous and barbarous orders?&rdquo; cried
      the clerk, singularly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most respectable authority, no doubt; but come, my worthy
      guardian, my excellent guardian,&rdquo; resumed the clerk, &ldquo;be a
      good fellow, and let us just take a peep in at the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, sir, only a peep!&rdquo; cried the heroes of the trowel,
      with a supplicating air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is disagreeable to have to refuse you, gentlemen,&rdquo;
      answered Samuel; &ldquo;but I cannot open this door, until I am alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The masons, seeing the inflexibility of the old man, unwillingly descended
      the steps; but the clerk had resolved to dispute the ground inch by inch,
      and exclaimed: &ldquo;I shall wait for my master. I do not leave the house
      without him. He may want me&mdash;and whether I remain on these steps or
      elsewhere, can be of little consequence to you my worthy keeper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk was interrupted in his appeal by his master himself, who called
      out from the further side of the courtyard, with an air of business:
      &ldquo;M. Piston! quick, M. Piston&mdash;come directly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil does he want with me?&rdquo; cried the clerk, in a
      passion. &ldquo;He calls me just at the moment when I might have seen
      something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Piston,&rdquo; resumed the voice, approaching, &ldquo;do you not
      hear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Samuel let out the masons, the clerk saw, through a clump of trees,
      his master running towards him bareheaded, and with an air of singular
      haste and importance. The clerk was therefore obliged to leave the steps,
      to answer the notary&rsquo;s summons, towards whom he went with a very bad
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir,&rdquo; said M. Dumesnil, &ldquo;I have been calling you
      this hour with all my might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hear you sir,&rdquo; said M. Piston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be deaf, then. Have you any change about you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; answered the clerk, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you must go instantly to the nearest stamp-office, and
      fetch me three or four large sheets of stamped paper, to draw up a deed.
      Run! it is wanted directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk, casting a rueful and regretful
      glance at the door of the walled-up house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But make haste, will you, M. Piston,&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, sir, where to get any stamped paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the guardian,&rdquo; replied M. Dumesnil. &ldquo;He will no
      doubt be able to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, Samuel was returning, after showing the masons out by the
      street-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the notary to him, &ldquo;will you please to tell
      me where we can get stamped paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close by, sir,&rdquo; answered Samuel; &ldquo;in the tobacconist&rsquo;s,
      No. 17, Rue Vieille-du-Temple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, M. Piston?&rdquo; said the notary to his clerk. &ldquo;You
      can get the stamps at the tobacconist&rsquo;s, No. 17, Rue
      Vieille-du-Temple. Be quick! for this deed must be executed immediately
      before the opening of the will. Time presses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir; I will make haste,&rdquo; answered the clerk,
      discontentedly, as he followed his master, who hurried back into the room
      where he had left Rodin, Gabriel, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Samuel, ascending the steps, had reached the door, now
      disencumbered of the stone, iron, and lead with which it had been blocked
      up. It was with deep emotion that the old man having selected from his
      bunch of keys the one he wanted, inserted it in the keyhole, and made the
      door turn upon its hinges. Immediately he felt on his face a current of
      damp, cold air, like that which exhales from a cellar suddenly opened.
      Having carefully re-closed and double-locked the door, the Jew advanced
      along the hall, lighted by a glass trefoil over the arch of the door. The
      panes had lost their transparency by the effect of time, and now had the
      appearance of ground-glass. This hall, paved with alternate squares of
      black and white marble, was vast, sonorous, and contained a broad
      staircase leading to the first story. The walls of smooth stone offered
      not the least appearance of decay or dampness; the stair-rail of wrought
      iron presented no traces of rust; it was inserted, just above the bottom
      step, into a column of gray granite, which sustained a statue of black
      marble, representing a negro bearing a flambeau. This statue had a strange
      countenance, the pupils of the eyes being made of white marble.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20223.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Jew&rsquo;s heavy tread echoed beneath the lofty dome of the hall. The
      grandson of Isaac Samuel experienced a melancholy feeling, as he reflected
      that the footsteps of his ancestor had probably been the last which had
      resounded through this dwelling, of which he had closed the doors a
      hundred and fifty years before; for the faithful friend, in favor of whom
      M. de Rennepont had made a feigned transfer of the property, had
      afterwards parted with the same, to place it in the name of Samuel&rsquo;s
      grandfather, who had transmitted it to his descendants, as if it had been
      his own inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these thoughts, in which Samuel was wholly absorbed, was joined the
      remembrance of the light seen that morning through the seven openings in
      the leaden cover of the belvedere; and, in spite of the firmness of his
      character, the old man could not repress a shudder, as, taking a second
      key from his bunch, and reading upon the label, The Key of the Red Room,
      he opened a pair of large folding doors, leading to the inner apartments.
      The window which, of all those in the house, had alone been opened,
      lighted this large room, hung with damask, the deep purple of which had
      undergone no alteration. A thick Turkey carpet covered the floor, and
      large arm-chairs of gilded wood, in the severe Louis XIV. style, were
      symmetrically arranged along the wall. A second door, leading to the next
      room, was just opposite the entrance. The wainscoting and the cornice were
      white, relieved with fillets and mouldings of burnished gold. On each side
      of this door was a large piece of buhl-furniture, inlaid with brass and
      porcelain, supporting ornamental sets of sea crackle vases. The window was
      hung with heavy deep-fringed damask curtains, surmounted by scalloped
      drapery, with silk tassels, directly opposite the chimney-piece of
      dark-gray marble, adorned with carved brass-work. Rich chandeliers, and a
      clock in the same style as the furniture, were reflected in a large Venice
      glass, with basiled edges. A round table, covered with a cloth of crimson
      velvet, was placed in the centre of this saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached this table, Samuel perceived a piece of white vellum, on
      which were inscribed these words: &ldquo;My testament is to be opened in
      this saloon. The other apartments are to remain closed, until after the
      reading of my last will&mdash;M. De R.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Jew, as he perused with emotion these lines
      traced so long ago; &ldquo;this is the same recommendation as that which I
      received from my father; for it would seem that the other apartments of
      this house are filled with objects, on which M. de Rennepont set a high
      value, not for their intrinsic worth, but because of their origin. The
      Hall of Mourning must be a strange and mysterious chamber. Well,&rdquo;
      added Samuel, as he drew from his pocket a register bound in black
      shagreen, with a brass lock, from which he drew the key, after placing it
      upon the table, &ldquo;here is the statement of the property in hand,
      which I have been ordered to bring hither, before the arrival of the
      heirs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The deepest silence reigned in the room, at the moment when Samuel placed
      the register on the table. Suddenly a simple and yet most startling
      occurrence roused him from his reverie. In the next apartment was heard
      the clear, silvery tone of a clock, striking slowly ten. And the hour was
      ten! Samuel had too much sense to believe in perpetual motion, or in the
      possibility of constructing a clock to go far one hundred and fifty years.
      He asked himself, therefore, with surprise and alarm, how this clock could
      still be going, and how it could mark so exactly the hour of the day.
      Urged with restless curiosity, the old man was about to enter the room;
      but recollecting the recommendation of his father, which had now been
      confirmed by the few lines he had just read from De Rennepont&rsquo;s pen,
      he stopped at the door, and listened with extreme attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing, but the last dying vibration of
      the clock. After having long reflected upon this strange fact, Samuel,
      comparing it with the no less extraordinary circumstance of the light
      perceived that morning through the apertures in the belvedere, concluded
      that there must be some connection between these two incidents. If the old
      man could not penetrate the true cause of these extraordinary appearances,
      he at least explained them to himself, by remembering the subterraneous
      communications, which, according to tradition, were said to exist between
      the cellars of this house and distant places; and he conjectured that
      unknown and mysterious personages thus gained access to it two or three
      times in a century. Absorbed in these thoughts Samuel approached the
      fireplace, which, as we have said, was directly opposite the window. Just
      then, a bright ray of sunlight, piercing the clouds, shone full upon two
      large portraits, hung upon either side of the fireplace, and not before
      remarked by the Jew. They were painted life size, and represented one a
      woman, the other a man. By the sober yet powerful coloring of these
      paintings, by the large and vigorous style, it was easy to recognize a
      master&rsquo;s hand. It would have been difficult to find models more
      fitted to inspire a great painter. The woman appeared to be from
      five-and-twenty to thirty years of age. Magnificent brown hair, with
      golden tints, crooned a forehead, white, noble, and lofty. Her head-dress,
      far from recalling the fashion, which Madame de Sevigne brought in during
      the age of Louis XIV., reminded one rather of some of the portraits of
      Paul Veronese, in which the hair encircles the face in broad, undulating
      bands, surmounted by a thick plait, like a crown, at the back of the head.
      The eyebrows, finely pencilled, were arched over large eyes of bright,
      sapphire blue. Their gaze at once proud and mournful, had something fatal
      about it. The nose, finely formed, terminated in slight dilated nostrils:
      a half smile, almost of pain, contracted the mouth; the face was a long
      oval, and the complexion, extremely pale, was hardly shaded on the cheek
      by a light rose-color. The position of the head and neck announced a rare
      mixture of grace and dignity. A sort of tunic or robe, of glossy black
      material, came as high as the commencement of her shoulders, and just
      marking her lithe and tall figure, reached down to her feet, which were
      almost entirely concealed by the folds of this garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude was full of nobleness and simplicity. The head looked white
      and luminous, standing out from a dark gray sky, marbled at the horizon by
      purple clouds, upon which were visible the bluish summits of distant
      hills, in deep shadow. The arrangement of the picture, as well as the warm
      tints of the foreground, contrasting strongly with these distant objects,
      showed that the woman was placed upon an eminence, from which she could
      view the whole horizon. The countenance was deeply pensive and desponding.
      There was an expression of supplicating and resigned grief, particularly
      in her look, half raised to heaven, which one would have thought
      impossible to picture. On the left side of the fireplace was the other
      portrait, painted with like vigor. It represented a man, between thirty
      and thirty-five years of age, of tall stature. A large brown cloak, which
      hung round him in graceful folds, did not quite conceal a black doublet,
      buttoned up to the neck, over which fell a square white collar. The
      handsome and expressive head was marked with stern powerful lines, which
      did not exclude an admirable air of suffering, resignation, and ineffable
      goodness. The hair, as well as the beard and eyebrows, was black; and the
      latter, by some singular caprice of nature, instead of being separated and
      forming two distinct arches, extended from one temple to the other, in a
      single bow, and seemed to mark the forehead of this man with a black line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The background of this picture also represented a stormy sky; but, beyond
      some rocks in the distance, the sea was visible, and appeared to mingle
      with the dark clouds. The sun, just now shining upon these two remarkable
      figures (which it appeared impossible to forget, after once seeing them),
      augmented their brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting from his reverie, and casting his eyes by chance upon these
      portraits, Samuel was greatly struck with them. They appeared almost
      alive. &ldquo;What noble and handsome faces!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he
      approached to examine them more closely. &ldquo;Whose are these portraits?
      They are not those of any of the Rennepont family, for my father told me
      that they are all in the Hall of Mourning. Alas!&rdquo; added the old man,
      &ldquo;one might think, from the great sorrow expressed in their
      countenances, that they ought to have a place in that mourning-chamber.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Samuel resumed: &ldquo;Let me prepare
      everything for this solemn assembly, for it has struck ten.&rdquo; So
      saying, he placed the gilded arm-chairs round the table, and then
      continued, with a pensive air: &ldquo;The hour approaches, and of the
      descendants of my grandfather&rsquo;s benefactor, we have seen only this
      young priest, with the angelic countenance. Can he be the sole
      representative of the Rennepont family? He is a priest, and this family
      will finish with him! Well! the moment is come when I must open this door,
      that the will may be read. Bathsheba is bringing hither the notary. They
      knock at the door; it is time!&rdquo; And Samuel, after casting a last
      glance towards the place where the clock had struck ten, hastened to the
      outer door, behind which voices were now audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the key twice in the lock, and threw the portals open. To his
      great regret, he saw only Gabriel on the steps, between Rodin and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      The notary, and Bathsheba, who had served them as a guide, waited a little
      behind the principal group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel could not repress a sigh, as he stood bowing on the threshold, and
      said to them: &ldquo;All is ready, gentlemen. You may walk in.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII. THE TESTAMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Gabriel,
      Rodin, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny entered the Red Room, they were
      differently affected. Gabriel, pale and sad, felt a kind of painful
      impatience. He was anxious to quit this house, though he had already
      relieved himself of a great weight, by executing before the notary,
      secured by every legal formality, a deed making over all his rights of
      inheritance to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. Until now it had not occurred to
      the young priest, that in bestowing the care upon him, which he was about
      to reward so generously, and in forcing his vocation by a sacrilegious
      falsehood, the only object of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny might have been to
      secure the success of a dark intrigue. In acting as he did, Gabriel was
      not yielding, in his view of the question, to a sentiment of exaggerated
      delicacy. He had made this donation freely, many years before. He would
      have looked upon it as infamy now to withdraw it. It was hard enough to be
      suspected of cowardice: for nothing in the world would he have incurred
      the least reproach of cupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary must have been endowed with a very rare and excellent
      nature, or this flower of scrupulous probity would have withered beneath
      the deleterious and demoralizing influence of his education; but happily,
      as cold sometimes preserves from corruption, the icy atmosphere in which
      he had passed a portion of his childhood and youth had benumbed, but not
      vitiated, his generous qualities, which had indeed soon revived in the
      warm air of liberty. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, much paler and more agitated
      than Gabriel, strove to excuse and explain his anxiety by attributing it
      to the sorrow he experienced at the rupture of his dear son with the
      Order. Rodin, calm, and perfectly master of himself, saw with secret rage
      the strong emotion of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, which might have inspired a
      man less confiding than Gabriel with strange suspicions. Yet,
      notwithstanding his apparent indifference, the socius was perhaps still
      more ardently impatient than his superior for the success of this
      important affair. Samuel appeared quite desponding, no other heir but
      Gabriel having presented himself. No doubt the old man felt a lively
      sympathy for the young priest; but then he was a priest, and with him
      would finish the line of Rennepont; and this immense fortune, accumulated
      with so much labor, would either be again distributed, or employed
      otherwise than the testator had desired. The different actors in this
      scene were standing around the table. As they were about to seat
      themselves, at the invitation of the notary, Samuel pointed to the
      register bound in black shagreen, and said: &ldquo;I was ordered, sir, to
      deposit here this register. It is locked. I will deliver up the key,
      immediately after the reading of the will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This course is, in fact, directed by the note which accompanies the
      will,&rdquo; said M. Dumesnil, &ldquo;as it was deposited, in the year
      1682, in the hands of Master Thomas Le Semelier, king&rsquo;s counsel, and
      notary of the Chatelet of Paris, then living at No. 13, Place Royale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, M. Dumesnil drew from a portfolio of red morocco a large
      parchment envelope, grown yellow with time; to this envelope was annexed,
      by a silken thread, a note also upon vellum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;if you please to sit
      down, I will read the subjoined note, to regulate the formalities at the
      opening of the will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, Rodin, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and Gabriel, took seats. The
      young priest, having his back turned to the fireplace, could not see the
      two portraits. In spite of the notary&rsquo;s invitation, Samuel remained
      standing behind the chair of that functionary, who read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the 13th February, 1832, my will shall be carried to No.
      3, in the Rue Saint-Francois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock precisely, the door of the Red Room
      shall be opened to my heirs, who will no doubt have arrived long before at
      Paris, in anticipation of this day, and will have had time to establish
      their line of descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As soon as they are assembled, the will shall be read, and,
      at the last stroke of noon, the inheritance shall be finally settled in
      favor of those of my kindred, who according to my recommendation
      (preserved, I hope, by tradition in my family, during a century and a
      half); shall present themselves in person, and not by agents, before
      twelve o&rsquo;clock, on the 13th of February, in the Rue Saint-Francois.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having read these words in a sonorous voice, the notary stopped an
      instant, and resumed, in a solemn tone: &ldquo;M. Gabriel Francois Marie
      de Rennepont, priest, having established, by legal documents, his descent
      on the father&rsquo;s side, and his relationship to the testator, and
      being at this hour the only one of the descendants of the Rennepont family
      here present, I open the testament in his presence, as it has been
      ordered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the notary drew from its envelope the will, which had been
      previously opened by the President of the Tribunal, with the formalities
      required by law. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny leaned forward, and resting his
      elbow on the table, seemed to pant for breath. Gabriel prepared himself to
      listen with more curiosity than interest. Rodin was seated at some
      distance from the table, with his old hat between his knees, in the bottom
      of which, half hidden by the folds of a shabby blue cotton handkerchief,
      he had placed his watch. The attention of the socius was divided between
      the least noise from without, and the slow evolution of the hands of the
      watch, which he followed with his little, wrathful eye, as if hastening
      their progress, so great was his impatience for the hour of noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary, unfolding the sheet of parchment, read what follows, in the
      midst of profound attention:
    </p>
    <p>
      Hameau de Villetaneuse,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;February 13th, 1682.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am about to escape, by death, from the disgrace of the
      galleys, to which the implacable enemies of my family have caused me to be
      condemned as a relapsed heretic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Moreover, life is too bitter for me since the death of my
      son, the victim of a mysterious crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At nineteen years of age&mdash;poor henry!&mdash;and his
      murderers unknown&mdash;no, not unknown&mdash;if I may trust my
      presentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To preserve my fortune for my son, I had feigned to abjure
      the Protestant faith. As long as that beloved boy lived, I scrupulously
      kept up Catholic appearances. The imposture revolted me, but the interest
      of my son was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When they killed him, this deceit became insupportable to
      me. I was watched, accused, and condemned as relapsed. My property has
      been confiscated, and I am sentenced to the galleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a terrible time we live in! Misery and servitude!
      sanguinary despotism and religious intolerance! Oh, it is sweet to abandon
      life! sweet to rest and see no more such evils and such sorrows!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In a few hours, I shall enjoy that rest. I shall die. Let me
      think of those who will survive&mdash;or rather, of those who will live
      perhaps in better times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Out of all my fortune, there remains to me a sum of fifty
      thousand crowns, deposited in a friend&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have no longer a son; but I have numerous relations,
      exiled in various parts of Europe. This sum of fifty thousand crowns,
      divided between them, would profit each of them very little. I have
      disposed of it differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In this I have followed the wise counsels of a man, whom I
      venerate as the image of God on earth, for his intelligence, wisdom, and
      goodness are almost divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twice in the course of my life have I seen this man, under
      very fatal circumstances&mdash;twice have I owed him safety, once of the
      soul, once of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Alas! he might perhaps have saved my poor child, but he came
      too late&mdash;too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Before he left me, he wished to divert me from the intention
      of dying&mdash;for he knew all. But his voice was powerless. My grief, my
      regret, my discouragement, were too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is strange! when he was convinced of my resolution to
      finish my days by violence, some words of terrible bitterness escaped him,
      making me believe that he envied me&mdash;my fate&mdash;my death!

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is he perhaps condemned to live?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; he has, no doubt, condemned himself to be useful to
      humanity, and yet life is heavy on him, for I heard him repeat one day,
      with an expression of despair and weariness that I have never forgotten:
      &ldquo;Life! life! who will deliver me from it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is life then so very burdensome to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He is gone. His last words have made me look for my
      departure with serenity. Thanks to him, my death shall not be without
      fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks to him, these lines, written at this moment by a man
      who, in a few hours, will have ceased to live, may perhaps be the parents
      of great things a century and a half hence&mdash;yes! great and noble
      things, if my last will is piously followed by my descendants, for it is
      to them that I here address myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That they may understand and appreciate this last will&mdash;which
      I commend to the care of the unborn, who dwell in the future whither I am
      hastening&mdash;they must know the persecutors of my family and avenge
      their ancestor, but by a noble vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My grandfather was a Catholic. Induced by perfidious
      counsels rather than religious zeal, he attached himself, though a layman,
      to a Society whose power has always been terrible and mysterious&mdash;the
      Society of Jesus&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words of the testament, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, Rodin, and
      Gabriel looked involuntarily at each other: The notary, who had not
      perceived this action, continued to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;After some years, during which he had never ceased to
      profess the most absolute devotion to this Society, he was suddenly
      enlightened by fearful revelations as to the secret ends it pursued, and
      the means it employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This was in 1510, a month before the assassination of Henry
      IV. &ldquo;&lsquo;My grandfather, terrified at the secret of which he had
      become the unwilling depositary, and which was to be fully explained by
      the death of the best of kings, not only broke with the Society, but, as
      if Catholicism itself had been answerable for the crimes of its members,
      he abandoned the Romish religion, in which he had hitherto lived, and
      became a Protestant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Undeniable proofs, attesting the connivance of two members
      of the Company with Ravaillac, a connivance also proved in the case of
      Jean Chatel, the regicide, were in my grandfather&rsquo;s possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This was the first cause of the violent hatred of the
      Society for our family. Thank Heaven, these papers have been placed in
      safety, and if my last will is executed, will be found marked A. M.C. D.
      G., in the ebony casket in the Hall of Mourning, in the house in the Rue
      Saint-Francois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My father was also exposed to these secret persecutions. His
      ruin, and perhaps his death, would have been the consequence, had it not
      been for the intervention of an angelic woman, towards whom he felt an
      almost religious veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The portrait of this woman, whom I saw a few years ago, as
      well as that of the man whom I hold in the greatest reverence, were
      painted by me from memory, and have been placed in the Red Room in the Rue
      Saint-Francois&mdash;to be gratefully valued, I hope, by the descendants
      of my family.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Gabriel had become more and more attentive to the reading
      of this testament. He thought within himself by how strange a coincidence
      one of his ancestors had, two centuries before, broken with the Society of
      Jesus, as he himself had just done; and that from this rupture, two
      centuries old, dated also that species of hatred with which the Society of
      Jesus had always pursued his family. Nor did the young priest find it less
      strange that this inheritance, transmitted to him after a lapse of a
      hundred and fifty years, from one of his kindred (the victim of the
      Society of Jesus), should return by a voluntary act to the coffers of this
      same society. When the notary read the passage relative to the two
      portraits, Gabriel, who, like Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, sat with his back
      towards the pictures, turned round to look at them. Hardly had the
      missionary cast his eyes on the portrait of the woman, than he uttered a
      loud cry of surprise, and almost terror. The notary paused in his reading,
      and looked uneasily at the young priest.

      CHAPTER XXIV. THE LAST STROKE OF NOON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the cry uttered
      by Gabriel, the notary had stopped reading the testament, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      hastily drew near the young priest. The latter rose trembling from his
      seat and gazed with increasing stupor at the female portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said in a low voice, as if speaking to himself. &ldquo;Good
      Heaven! is it possible that nature can produce such resemblances? Those
      eyes&mdash;so proud and yet so sad&mdash;that forehead&mdash;that pale
      complexion&mdash;yes, all her features, are the same&mdash;all of them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son, what is the matter?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      as astonished as Samuel and the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight months ago,&rdquo; replied the missionary, in a voice of deep
      emotion, without once taking his eyes from the picture, &ldquo;I was in
      the power of the Indians, in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. They had
      crucified, and were beginning to scalp me; I was on the point of death,
      when Divine Providence sent me unexpected aid&mdash;sent me this woman for
      a deliverer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman!&rdquo; cried Samuel, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and the
      notary, all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin alone appeared completely indifferent to this episode of the
      picture. His face contracted with angry impatience, he bit his nails to
      the quick, as he contemplated with agony the slow progress of the hands of
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! that woman saved your life?&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this woman,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, in a still lower and more
      trembling voice; &ldquo;this woman&mdash;or rather a woman so much
      resembling her, that if this picture had not been here for a century and a
      half, I should have felt sure it was the same&mdash;nor can I explain to
      myself that so striking a resemblance could be the effect of chance. Well,&rdquo;
      added he, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, as he heaved a profound sigh,
      &ldquo;the mysteries of Nature, and the will of God, are impenetrable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel fell back into his chair, in the midst of a general silence, which
      was broken by Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny saying, &ldquo;It is a case of
      extraordinary resemblance; that is all, my dear son. Only, the natural
      gratitude which you feel towards your benefactress, makes you take a deep
      interest in this singular coincidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, bursting with impatience, here said to the notary, by whose side he
      stood, &ldquo;It seems to me, sir, that all this little romance has
      nothing to do with the testament.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; answered the notary, resuming his seat;
      &ldquo;but the fact is so extraordinary, and as you say, romantic, that
      one cannot help sharing in this gentleman&rsquo;s astonishment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to Gabriel, who, with his elbow resting on the arms of the
      chair, leaned his forehead upon his hand, apparently quite absorbed in
      thought. The notary continued the reading of the will, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Such are the persecutions to which my family has been
      exposed on the part of the Society of Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Society possesses at this hour the whole of my
      confiscated property. I am about to die. May its hatred perish with me,
      and spare my kindred, whose fate at this solemn moment is my last and only
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This morning I sent for a man of long tried probity Isaac
      Samuel. He owes his life to me, and every day I congratulate myself on
      having been able to preserve to the world so honest and excellent a
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Before the confiscation of my property, Isaac Samuel had
      long managed it with as much intelligence as uprightness. I have entrusted
      him with the fifty thousand crowns, returned to me by a faithful friend.
      Isaac Samuel, and his descendants after him, to whom he will leave this
      debt of gratitude, will invest the above sum, and allow it to accumulate,
      until the expiration of the hundred and fiftieth year from this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The amount thus accumulated may become enormous, and
      constitute a royal fortune, if no unfavorable event should occur. May my
      descendants attend to my wishes, as to the division and employment of this
      immense sum!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In a century and a half, there happen so many changes, so
      many varieties of fortunes, such a rise and fall in the condition of the
      successive generations of a family, that probably, a hundred and fifty
      years hence, my descendants will belong to various classes of society, and
      thus represent the divers social elements of their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There may, perhaps, be among them men of great intelligence
      great courage, or great virtue&mdash;learned men, or names illustrious in
      arts and arms. There may, perhaps, also be obscure workmen, or humble
      citizens&mdash;perhaps, also, alas! great criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;However, this may be, my most earnest desire is that my
      descendants should combine together, and, reconstituting one family, by a
      close and sincere union, put into practice the divine words of Christ,
      &ldquo;Love ye one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This union would have a salutary tendency; for it seems to
      me that upon union, upon the association of men together, must depend the
      future happiness of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Company, which so long persecuted my family, is one of
      the most striking examples of the power of association, even when applied
      to evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There is something so fruitful and divine in this principle,
      that it sometimes forces to good the worst and most dangerous
      combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thus, the missions have thrown a scanty but pure and
      generous light on the darkness of this Company of Jesus&mdash;founded with
      the detestable and impious aim of destroying, by a homicidal education,
      all will, thought, liberty, and intelligence, in the people, so as to
      deliver them, trembling, superstitious, brutal, and helpless, to the
      despotism of kings, governed in their turn by confessors belonging to the
      Society.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this passage of the will, there was another strange look exchanged
      between Gabriel and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. The notary continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If a perverse association, based upon the degradation of
      humanity, upon fear and despotism, and followed by the maledictions of the
      people, has survived for centuries, and often governed the world by craft
      and terror&mdash;how would it be with an association, which, taking
      fraternity and evangelic love for its means, had for its end to deliver
      man and woman from all degrading slavery, to invite to the enjoyment of
      terrestrial happiness those who have hitherto known nothing of life but
      its sorrows and miseries, and to glorify and enrich the labor that feeds
      the state?&mdash;to enlighten those whom ignorance has depraved?&mdash;to
      favor the free expansion of all the passions, which God, in His infinite
      wisdom, and inexhaustible goodness, gave to man as so many powerful
      levers?&mdash;to sanctify all the gifts of Heaven: love, maternity,
      strength, intelligence, beauty, genius?&mdash;to make men truly religious,
      and deeply grateful to their Creator, by making them understand the
      splendors of Nature, and bestowing on them their rightful share in the
      treasures which have been poured upon us?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! if it be Heaven&rsquo;s will that, in a century and a
      half, the descendants of my family, faithful to the last wishes of a heart
      that loved humanity, meet in this sacred union!&mdash;if it be Heaven&rsquo;s
      will that amongst them be found charitable and passionate souls, full of
      commiseration for those who suffer, and lofty minds, ardent for liberty!
      warm and eloquent natures! resolute characters! women, who unite beauty
      and wit with goodness&mdash;oh! then, how fruitful, how powerful will be
      the harmonious union of all these ideas, and influences, and forces&mdash;of
      all these attractions grouped round that princely fortune, which,
      concentrated by association, and wisely managed, would render practicable
      the most admirable Utopias!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What a wondrous centre of fertile and generous thoughts!
      What precious and life-giving rays would stream incessantly from this
      focus of charity, emancipation, and love! What great things might be
      attempted what magnificent examples given to the world! What a divine
      mission! What an irresistible tendency towards good might be impressed on
      the whole human race by a family thus situated, and in possession of such
      means!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And, then, such a beneficent association would be able to
      combat the fatal conspiracy of which I am the victim, and which, in a
      century and a half, may have lost none of its formidable power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So, to this work of darkness, restraint, and despotism,
      which weighs heavily on the Christian world, my family would oppose their
      work of light, expansion, and liberty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The genii of good and evil would stand face to face. The
      struggle would commence, and God would protect the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And that these immense pecuniary resources, which will give
      so much power to my family, may not be exhausted by the course of years,
      my heirs, following my last will, are to place out, upon the same
      conditions, double the sum that I have invested&mdash;so that, a century
      and a half later, a new source of power and action will be at the disposal
      of their descendants. What a perpetuity of good!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the ebony cabinet of the Hall of Mourning will be found
      some practical suggestions on the subject of this association.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Such is my last will&mdash;or rather, such are my last
      hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When I require absolutely that the members of my family
      should appear in person in the Rue Saint-Francois, on the day of the
      opening of this testament, it is so that, united in that solemn moment,
      they may see and know each other. My words may then, perhaps, have some
      effect upon them; and, instead of living divided, they will combine
      together. It will be for their own interest, and my wishes will thus be
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When I sent, a few days ago, to those of my family whom
      exile has dispersed over Europe, a medal on which is engravers the date of
      the convocation of my heirs, a century and a half from this time, I was
      forced to keep secret my true motive, and only to tell them, that my
      descendants would find it greatly to their interest to attend this
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have acted thus, because I know the craft and perseverance
      of the society of which I have been the victim. If they could guess that
      my descendants would hereafter have to divide immense sums between them,
      my family would run the risk of much fraud and malice, through the fatal
      recommendations handed down from age to age in the Society of Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;May these precautions be successful! May the wish, expressed
      upon these medals, be faithfully transmitted from generation to
      generation!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I fix a day and hour, in which my inheritance shall
      irrevocably fall to those of my descendants who shall appear in the Rue
      Saint-Francois on the 13th February, in 1832, it is that all delays must
      have a term, and that my heirs will have been sufficiently informed years
      before of the great importance of this meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;After the reading of my testament, the person who shall then
      be the trustee of the accumulated funds, shall make known their amount, so
      that, with the last stroke of noon, they may be divided between my heirs
      then and there present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The different apartments of the house shall then be opened
      to them. They will see in them divers objects, well worthy of interest,
      pity, and respect&mdash;particularly in the Hall of Mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My desire is, that the house may not be sold, but that it
      may remain furnished as it is, and serve as a place of meeting for my
      descendants, if, as I hope, they attend to my last wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If, on the contrary, they are divided amongst themselves&mdash;if,
      instead of uniting for one of the most generous enterprises that ever
      signalized an age, they yield to the influence of selfish passions&mdash;if
      they prefer a sterile individuality to a fruitful association&mdash;if, in
      this immense fortune, they see only an opportunity for frivolous
      dissipation, or sordid interest&mdash;may they be accursed by all those
      whom they might have loved, succored, and disfettered!&mdash;and then let
      this house be utterly demolished and destroyed, and the papers, of which
      Isaac Samuel possesses the inventory, as well as the two portraits in the
      Red Room, be burnt by the guardian of the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have spoken. My duty is accomplished. In all this, I have
      followed the counsels of the man whom I revere and love as the image of
      God upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The faithful friend, who preserved for me the fifty thousand
      crowns, the wreck of my fortune, knows the use I mean to make of them. I
      could not refuse his friendship this mark of confidence. But I have
      concealed from him the name of Isaac Samuel&mdash;for to have mentioned it
      might have exposed this latter and his descendants to great dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In a short time, this friend, who knows not that my
      resolution to die is so near its accomplishment, will come hither with my
      notary. Into their hands, after the usual formalities, I shall deliver my
      sealed testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Such is my last will. I leave its execution to the
      superintending care of Providence. God will protect the cause of love,
      peace, union, and liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This mystic testament,(20) having been freely made by me,
      and written entirely with my own hand, I intend and will its scrupulous
      execution both in spirit and the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This 13th day of February, 1682, at one o&rsquo;clock in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;&lsquo;MARIUS DE RENNEPONT.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As the notary had proceeded with the reading of the testament, Gabriel was
      successively agitated by divers painful impressions. At first, as we have
      before said, he was struck with the singular fatality which restored this
      immense fortune, derived from a victim of the Society of Jesus, to the
      hands of that very association, by the renewal of his deed of gift. Then,
      as his charitable and lofty soul began fully to comprehend the admirable
      tendency of the association so earnestly recommended by Marius de
      Rennepont, he reflected with bitter remorse, that, in consequence of his
      act of renunciation, and of the absence of any other heir, this great idea
      would never be realized, and a fortune, far more considerable than had
      even been expected, would fall to the share of an ill-omened society, in
      whose hands it would become a terrible means of action. At the same time,
      it must be said that the soul of Gabriel was too pure and noble to feel
      the slightest personal regret, on hearing the great probable value of the
      property he had renounced. He rejoiced rather in withdrawing his mind, by
      a touching contrast, from the thought of the wealth he had abandoned, to
      the humble parsonage, where he hoped to pass the remainder of his life, in
      the practice of most evangelical virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ideas passed confusedly through his brain. The sight of that woman&rsquo;s
      portrait, the dark revelations contained in the testament, the grandeur of
      the views exhibited in this last will of M. de Rennepont, all these
      extraordinary incidents had thrown Gabriel into a sort of stupor, in which
      he was still plunged, when Samuel offered the key of the register to the
      notary, saying: &ldquo;You will find, sir, in this register, the exact
      statement of the sums in my possession, derived from the investment and
      accumulation of the one hundred and fifty thousand francs, entrusted to my
      grandfather by M. Marius de Rennepont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with the
      utmost surprise; &ldquo;it is then your family that has always had the
      management of this property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and, in a few minutes, my wife will bring hither the
      casket which contains the vouchers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to what sum does this property amount?&rdquo; asked Rodin, with
      an air of the most complete indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As M. Notary may convince himself by this statement,&rdquo; replied
      Samuel, with perfect frankness, and as if he were only talking of the
      original one hundred and fifty thousand francs, &ldquo;I have in my
      possession various current securities to the amount of two hundred and
      twelve millions, one hundred and seventy&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say, sir&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, without
      giving Samuel time to finish, for the odd money did not at all interest
      his reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the sum!&rdquo; added Rodin, in an agitated voice, and, for
      the first time, perhaps, in his life losing his presence of mind; &ldquo;the
      sum&mdash;the sum&mdash;the sum!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, sir,&rdquo; resumed the old man, &ldquo;that I hold
      securities for two hundred and twelve millions, one hundred and
      seventy-five thousand francs, payable to self or bearer&mdash;as you may
      soon convince yourself, M. Notary, for here is my wife with the casket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, at this moment, Bathsheba entered, holding in her arms the cedar
      wood chest, which contained the securities in question; she placed it upon
      the table, and withdrew, after exchanging an affectionate glance with
      Samuel. When the latter declared the enormous amount of the sum in hand,
      his words were received with silent stupor. All the actors in this scene,
      except himself, believed that they were the sport of some delusion. Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin had counted upon forty millions. This sum, in
      itself enormous, was more than quintupled. Gabriel, when he heard the
      notary read those passages in the testament, which spoke of a princely
      fortune, being quite ignorant of the prodigious effects of eligible
      investments, had valued the property at some three or four millions. He
      was, therefore, struck dumb with amazement at the exorbitant amount named.
      Notwithstanding his admirable disinterestedness and scrupulous honor, he
      felt dazzled and giddy at the thought, that all these immense riches might
      have belonged to him&mdash;alone. The notary, almost as much amazed as
      Gabriel, examined the statement, and could hardly believe his eyes. The
      Jew also remained mute, and seemed painfully absorbed in thought, that no
      other heir made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the depth of this profound silence, the clock in the next room began
      slowly to strike twelve. Samuel started, and heaved a deep sigh. A few
      seconds more, and the fatal term would be at an end. Rodin, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      Gabriel, and the notary, were all under the influence of such complete
      surprise, that not one of them even remarked how strange it was to hear
      the sound of this clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noon!&rdquo; cried Rodin, as, by an involuntary movement, he
      hastily placed his two hands upon the casket, as if to take possession of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with an expression
      of joy, triumph transport, which it is impossible to describe. Then he
      added, as he threw himself into Gabriel&rsquo;s arms, whom he embraced
      warmly: &ldquo;Oh, my dear son! how the poor will bless you! You will be a
      second Vincent de Paul. You will be canonized, I promise you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us first thank Providence,&rdquo; said Rodin, in a grave and
      solemn tone, as he fell upon his knees, &ldquo;let us thank Providence,
      that He has permitted so much wealth to be employed for His glory!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, having again embraced Gabriel, took him by the
      hand, and said: &ldquo;Rodin is right. Let us kneel, my dear son, and
      render thanks to Providence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny knelt down, dragging Gabriel with him,
      and the latter, confused and giddy with so many precipitate events,
      yielded mechanically to the impulse. It was the last stroke of twelve when
      they all rose together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said the notary, in a slightly agitated voice, for there was
      something extraordinary and solemn in this scene&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other heir of M. Marius de Rennepont having presented himself,
      before noon on this day, I execute the will of the testator, by declaring,
      in the name of law and justice, that M. Francois Marie Gabriel de
      Rennepont, here present, is the sole heir and possessor of all the estate,
      real and personal, bequeathed under the said will; all which estate the
      said Gabriel de Rennepont, priest, has freely and voluntarily made over by
      deed of gift to Frederic Emanuel de Bordeville, Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      priest, who has accepted the same, and is, therefore, the only legal
      holder of such property, in the room of the said Gabriel de Rennepont, by
      virtue of the said deed, drawn up and engrossed by me this morning, and
      signed in my presence by the said Gabriel de Rennepont and Frederic d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the sound of loud voices was heard from the garden.
      Bathsheba entered hastily, and said to her husband with an agitated air:
      &ldquo;Samuel&mdash;a soldier&mdash;who insists&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not time to finish. Dagobert appeared at the door of the Red Room.
      The soldier was fearfully pale. He seemed almost fainting; his left arm
      was in a sling, and he leaned upon Agricola. At sight of Dagobert, the
      pale and flabby eyelids of Rodin were suddenly distended, as if all the
      blood in his body had flowed towards the head. Then the socius threw
      himself upon the casket, with the haste of ferocious rage and avidity, as
      if he were resolved to cover it with his body, and defend it at the peril
      of his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE DEED OF GIFT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ather d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      did not recognize Dagobert, and had never seen Agricola. He could not
      therefore, at first explain the kind of angry alarm exhibited by Rodin.
      But the reverend father understood it all, when he heard Gabriel utter a
      cry of joy, and saw him rush into the arms of the smith, exclaiming:
      &ldquo;My brother! my second father&mdash;oh! it is heaven that sends you
      to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having pressed Gabriel&rsquo;s hand, Dagobert advanced towards Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a rapid but unsteady step. As he remarked the soldier&rsquo;s
      threatening countenance, the reverend father, strong in his acquired
      rights, and feeling that, since noon, he was at home here; drew back a
      little, and said imperiously to the veteran: &ldquo;Who are you, sir!&mdash;What
      do you want here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, the soldier continued to advance, then, stopping
      just facing Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, he looked at him for a second with
      such an astounding mixture of curiosity, disdain, aversion, and audacity,
      that the ex-colonel of hussars quailed before the pale face and glowing
      eye of the veteran. The notary and Samuel, struck with surprise, remained
      mute spectators of this scene, while Agricola and Gabriel followed with
      anxiety Dagobert&rsquo;s least movements. As for Rodin, he pretended to be
      leaning on the casket, in order still to cover it with his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surmounting at length the embarrassment caused by the steadfast look of
      the soldier, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny raised his head, and repeated.
      &ldquo;I ask you, sir, who you are, and what you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not recognize me?&rdquo; said Dagobert, hardly able to
      restrain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; returned the soldier, with profound contempt,
      &ldquo;You cast down your eyes for shame when, at Leipsic, you fought for
      the Russians against the French, and when General Simon, covered with
      wounds, answered you, renegade that you were, when you asked him for his
      sword, &lsquo;I do not surrender to a traitor!&rsquo;&mdash;and dragged
      himself along to one of the Russian grenadiers, to whom he yielded up his
      weapon. Well! there was then a wounded soldier by the side of General
      Simon&mdash;I am he.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In brief, sir, what do you want?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      hardly, able to control himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to unmask you&mdash;you, that are as false and hateful
      a priest, as Gabriel is admirable and beloved by all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried the marquis, becoming livid with rage and
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, that you are infamous,&rdquo; resumed the soldier, with
      still greater force. &ldquo;To rob Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters, and
      Gabriel, and Mdlle. de Cardoville of their inheritance, you have had
      recourse to the most shameful means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cried Gabriel. &ldquo;The daughters of
      Marshal Simon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your relations, my dear boy, as is also that worthy Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, the benefactress of Agricola. Now, this priest,&rdquo; he
      added, pointing to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;has had them shut up&mdash;the
      one as mad, in a lunatic asylum&mdash;the others in a convent. As for you,
      my dear boy, I did not hope to find you here, believing that they would
      have prevented you, like the others, from coming hither this morning. But,
      thank God, you are here, and I arrive in time. I should have been sooner,
      but for my wound. I have lost so much blood, that I have done nothing but
      faint all the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; cried Gabriel, with uneasiness. &ldquo;I had not
      remarked your arm in a sling. What is the wound?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Agricola, Dagobert answered: &ldquo;Nothing; the
      consequence of a fall. But here I am, to unveil many infamies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to paint the curiosity, anguish, surprise, or fear, of
      the different actors in this scene, as they listened to Dagobert&rsquo;s
      threatening words. But the most overcome was Gabriel. His angelic
      countenance was distorted, his knees trembled under him. Struck by the
      communication of Dagobert which revealed the existence of other heirs, he
      was unable to speak for some time; at length, he cried out, in a tone of
      despair: &ldquo;And it is I&mdash;oh, God! I&mdash;who am the cause of the
      spoliation of this family!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, brother?&rdquo; exclaimed Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they not wish to rob you also?&rdquo; added Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The will,&rdquo; cried Gabriel, with increasing agony, &ldquo;gave
      the property to those of the heirs that should appear before noon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Dagobert, alarmed at the emotion of the young
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock has struck,&rdquo; resumed the latter. &ldquo;Of
      all the family, I alone was present. Do you understand it now? The term is
      expired. The heirs have been thrust aside by me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By you!&rdquo; said Dagobert, stammering with joy. &ldquo;By you,
      my brave boy! then all is well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, radiant with delight. &ldquo;You
      will share with the others&mdash;I know you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this property I have irrevocably, made over to another,&rdquo;
      cried Gabriel, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made over the property!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, quite petrified.
      &ldquo;To whom, then?&mdash;to whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To this gentleman,&rdquo; said Gabriel, pointing to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him!&rdquo; exclaimed Dagobert, overwhelmed by the news; &ldquo;to
      him&mdash;the renegade&mdash;who has always been the evil genius of this
      family!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, brother,&rdquo; cried Agricola, &ldquo;did you then know your
      claim to this inheritance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the young priest, with deep dejection; &ldquo;no&mdash;I
      only learned it this morning, from Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. He told me,
      that he had only recently been informed of my rights, by family papers
      long ago found upon me, and sent by our mother to her confessor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden light seemed to dawn upon the mind of the smith, as he exclaimed:
      &ldquo;I understand it all now. They discovered in these papers, that you
      would one day have a chance of becoming rich. Therefore, they interested
      themselves about you&mdash;therefore, they took you into their college,
      where we could never see you&mdash;therefore, they deceived you in your
      vocation by shameful falsehoods, to force you to become a priest, and to
      lead you to make this deed of gift. Oh, sir!&rdquo; resumed Agricola,
      turning towards Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with indignation, &ldquo;my
      father is right&mdash;such machinations are indeed infamous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this scene, the reverend father and his socius, at first alarmed
      and shaken in their audacity, had by degrees recovered all their coolness.
      Rodin, still leaning upon the casket, had said a few words in a low voice
      to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. So that when Agricola, carried away by his
      indignation, reproached the latter with his infamous machinations, he
      bowed his head humbly, and answered: &ldquo;We are bound to forgive
      injuries, and offer them to the Lord as a mark of our humility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, confounded at all he had just heard, felt his reason begin to
      wander. After so much anxiety, his strength failed beneath this new and
      terrible blow. Agricola&rsquo;s just and sensible words, in connection
      with certain passages of the testament, at once enlightened Gabriel as to
      the views of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in taking charge of his education,
      and leading him to join the Society of Jesus. For the first time in his
      life, Gabriel was able to take in at a glance all the secret springs of
      the dark intrigue, of which he had been the victim. Then, indignation and
      despair surmounting his natural timidity, the missionary, with flashing
      eye, and cheeks inflamed with noble wrath, exclaimed, as he addressed
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: &ldquo;So, father, when you placed me in one of
      your colleges, it was not from any feeling of kindness or commiseration,
      but only in the hope of bringing me one day to renounce in favor of your
      Order my share in this inheritance; and it did not even suffice you to
      sacrifice me to your cupidity, but I must also be rendered the involuntary
      instrument of a shameful spoliation! If only I were concerned&mdash;if you
      only coveted my claim to all this wealth, I should not complain. I am the
      minister of a religion which honors and sanctifies poverty; I have
      consented to the donation in your favor, and I have not, I could never
      have any claim upon it. But property is concerned which belong to poor
      orphans, brought from a distant exile by my adopted father, and I will not
      see them wronged. But the benefactress of my adopted brother is concerned,
      and I will not see her wronged. But the last will of a dying man is
      concerned, who, in his ardent love of humanity, bequeathed to his
      descendants an evangelic mission&mdash;an admirable mission of progress,
      love, union, liberty&mdash;and I will not see this mission blighted in its
      bud. No, no; I tell you, that this his mission shall be accomplished,
      though I have to cancel the donation I have made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin looked at each other
      with a slight shrug of the shoulders. At a sign from the socius, the
      reverend father began to speak with immovable calmness, in a slow and
      sanctified voice, keeping eyes constantly cast down: &ldquo;There are many
      incidents connected with this inheritance of M. de Rennepont, which appear
      very complicated&mdash;many phantoms, which seem un usually menacing&mdash;and
      yet, nothing could be really more simple and natural. Let us proceed in
      regular order. Let us put aside all these calumnious imputations; we will
      return to them afterwards. M. Gabriel de Rennepont&mdash;and I humbly beg
      him to contradict me, if I depart in the least instance from the exact
      truth&mdash;M. Gabriel de Rennepont, in acknowledgment of the care
      formerly bestowed on him by the society to which I have the honor to
      belong, made over to me, as its representative, freely and voluntarily,
      all the property that might come to him one day, the value of which was
      unknown to him, as well as to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny here looked at Gabriel, as if appealing to him for
      the truth of this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the young priest: &ldquo;I made this
      donation freely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, in consequence of a private conversation, which I
      will not repeat&mdash;and in this, I am certain beforehand, of the Abbe
      Gabriel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Gabriel, generously; &ldquo;the subject of
      this conversation is of little importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then, in consequence of this conversation that the Abbe
      Gabriel manifested the desire to confirm this donation&mdash;not in my
      favor, for I have little to do with earthly wealth&mdash;but in favor of
      the sacred and charitable works of which our Company is the trustee. I
      appeal to the honor of M. Gabriel to declare if he have not engaged
      himself towards us, not only by a solemn oath, but by a perfectly legal
      act, executed in presence of M. Dumesnil, here present?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all true,&rdquo; answered Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deed was prepared by me,&rdquo; added the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Gabriel could only give you what belonged to him,&rdquo; cried
      Dagobert. &ldquo;The dear boy never supposed that you were making use of
      him to rob other people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me the favor, sir, to allow me to explain myself,&rdquo; replied
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, courteously; &ldquo;you can afterwards make
      answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert repressed with difficulty his painful impatience. The reverend
      father continued: &ldquo;The Abbe Gabriel has therefore, by the double
      engagement of an oath and a legal act, confirmed his donation. Much more,&rdquo;
      resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: &ldquo;when to his great astonishment and
      to ours, the enormous amount of the inheritance became known, the Abbe
      Gabriel, faithful to his own admirable generosity, far from repenting of
      his gifts, consecrated them once more by a pious movement of gratitude to
      Providence&mdash;for M. Notary will doubtless remember, that, after
      embracing the Abbe Gabriel with transport, and telling him that he was a
      second Vincent de Paul in charity, I took him by the hand, and we both
      knelt down together to thank heaven for having inspired him with the
      thought too offer these immense riches to the Greater Glory of the Lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, also,&rdquo; said Gabriel, honestly; &ldquo;so long
      as myself was concerned, though I might be astounded for a moment by the
      revelation of so enormous a fortune, I did not think for an instant of
      cancelling the donation I had freely made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;the hour fixed for the settlement of the inheritance having struck,
      and Abbe Gabriel being the only heir that presented himself, he became
      necessarily the only legitimate possessor of this immense wealth&mdash;enormous,
      no doubt&mdash;and charity makes me rejoice that it is enormous, for,
      thanks to it, many miseries will be relieved and many tears wiped away.
      But, all on a sudden, here comes this gentleman,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      pointing to Dagobert; &ldquo;and, under some delusion, which I forgive
      from the bottom of my soul, and which I am sure he will himself regret,
      accuses me, with insults and threats, with having carried off (I know not
      where) some persons (I know not whom), in order to prevent their being
      here at the proper time&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I accuse you of this infamy!&rdquo; cried the soldier
      exasperated by the calmness and audacity of the reverend father: &ldquo;yes&mdash;and
      I will&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once again, sir, I conjure you to be so good as to let me finish;
      you can reply afterwards,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, humbly, in
      the softest and most honeyed accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will reply, and confound you!&rdquo; cried Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him finish, father. You can speak presently,&rdquo; said
      Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier was silent as Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny continued with new
      assurance: &ldquo;Doubtless, if there should really be any other heirs,
      besides the Abbe Gabriel, it is unfortunate for them that they have not
      appeared in proper time. And if, instead of defending the cause of the
      poor and needy, I had only to look to my own interest, I should be far
      from availing myself of this advantage, due only to chance; but, as a
      trustee for the great family of the poor, I am obliged to maintain my
      absolute right to this inheritance; and I do not doubt that M. Notary will
      acknowledge the validity of my claim, and deliver to me these securities,
      which are now my legitimate property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only mission,&rdquo; replied the notary, in an agitated voice,
      &ldquo;is faithfully to execute the will of the testator. The Abbe Gabriel
      de Rennepont alone presented himself, within the term fixed by the
      testament. The deed of gift is in due form; I cannot refuse, therefore, to
      deliver to the person named in the deed the amount of the heritage&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words Samuel hid his face in his hands, and heaved a deep sigh;
      he was obliged to acknowledge the rigorous justice of the notary&rsquo;s
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, addressing the man of law, &ldquo;this
      cannot be. You will not allow two poor orphans to be despoiled. It is in
      the name of their father and mother that I speak to you. I give you my
      honor&mdash;the honor of a soldier!&mdash;that they took advantage of the
      weakness of my wife to carry the daughters of Marshal Simon to a convent,
      and thus prevent me bringing them here this morning. It is so true, that I
      have already laid my charge before a magistrate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what answer did you receive?&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That my deposition was not sufficient for the law to remove these
      young girls from the convent in which they were, and that inquiries would
      be made&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; added Agricola, &ldquo;and it was the same with
      regard to Mdlle. de Cardoville, detained as mad in a lunatic asylum,
      though in the full enjoyment of her reason. Like Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters, she too has a claim to this inheritance. I took the same steps
      for her, as my father took for Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, sir,&rdquo; answered Agricola, &ldquo;they told me;
      as they did my father, that my deposition would not suffice, and that they
      must make inquiries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Bathsheba, having heard the street-bell ring, left the Red
      Room at a sign from Samuel. The notary resumed, addressing Agricola and
      his father: &ldquo;Far be it from me, gentlemen, to call in question your
      good faith; but I cannot, to my great regret, attach such importance to
      your accusations, which are not supported by proof, as to suspend the
      regular legal course. According to your own confession, gentlemen, the
      authorities, to whom you addressed yourselves, did not see fit to
      interfere on your depositions, and told you they would inquire further.
      Now, really, gentlemen, I appeal to you: how can I, in so serious a
      matter, take upon myself a responsibility, which the magistrates
      themselves have refused to take?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you should do so, in the name of justice and honor?&rdquo;
      cried Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so, sir, in your opinion; but in my view of the case, I
      remain faithful to justice and honor, by executing with exactness the last
      will of the dead. For the rest you have no occasion to despair. If the
      persons, whose interests you represent, consider themselves injured, they
      may hereafter have recourse to an action at law, against the person
      receiving as donee of the Abbe Gabriel&mdash;but in the meanwhile, it is
      my duty to put him in immediate possession of the securities. I should be
      gravely injured, were I to act in any, other manner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The notary&rsquo;s observations seemed so reasonable, that Samuel,
      Dagobert and Agricola were quite confounded. After a moment&rsquo;s
      thought, Gabriel appeared to take a desperate resolution, and said to the
      notary, in a firm voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since, under these circumstances, the law is powerless to obtain
      the right, I must adopt, sir, an extreme course. Before doing so, I will
      ask M. l&rsquo;Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, for the last time, if he will
      content himself with that portion of the property which falls justly to
      me, on condition that the rest shall be placed in safe hands, till the
      heirs, whose names have been brought forward, shall prove their claim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To this proposition I must answer as I have done already,&rdquo;
      replied Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny; &ldquo;it is not I who am concerned, but
      an immense work of charity. I am, therefore, obliged to refuse the
      part-offer of the Abbe Gabriel, and to remind him of his engagements of
      every kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse this arrangement?&rdquo; asked Gabriel, in an
      agitated voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity commands me to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse it&mdash;absolutely?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of all the good and pious institutions that these treasures
      will enable us to establish for the Greater Glory of the Lord, and I have
      neither the courage nor the desire to make the least concession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; resumed the good priest, in a still more agitated
      manner, &ldquo;since you force me to do it, I revoke my donation. I only
      intended to dispose of my own property, and not of that which did not
      belong to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care M. l&rsquo;Abbe,&rdquo; said rather d&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;I would observe that I hold in my hand a written, formal promise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, sir; you have a written paper, in which I take an oath
      never to revoke this donation, upon any pretext whatever, and on pain of
      incurring the aversion and contempt of all honest men. Well, sir! be it
      so,&rdquo; said Gabriel, with deep bitterness; &ldquo;I will expose myself
      to all the consequences of perjury; you may proclaim it everywhere. I may
      be hated and despised by all&mdash;but God will judge me!&rdquo; The young
      priest dried a tear, which trickled from his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not be afraid, my dear boy!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, with
      reviving hope. &ldquo;All honest men will be on your side!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, brother!&rdquo; said Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Notary,&rdquo; said Rodin, in his little sharp voice, &ldquo;please
      to explain to Abbe Gabriel, that he may perjure himself as much as he
      thinks fit, but that the Civil Code is much less easy to violate than a
      mere promise, which is only&mdash;sacred!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, sir,&rdquo; said Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to inform Abbe Gabriel,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;that a
      deed of gift, like that made in favor of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, can only
      be cancelled for one of three reasons&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, for three reasons,&rdquo; said the notary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first is in case of the birth of a child,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      &ldquo;and I should blush to mention such a contingency to the Abbe
      Gabriel. The second is the ingratitude of the donee&mdash;and the Abbe
      Gabriel may be certain of our deep and lasting gratitude. The last case is
      the non-fulfilment of the wishes of the donor, with regard to the
      employment of his gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, although the Abbe Gabriel may have suddenly conceived a very
      bad opinion of us, he will at least give us some time to show that his
      gifts have been disposed of according to his wishes, and applied to the
      Greater Glory of the Lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, M. Notary,&rdquo; added Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;it is
      for you to decide and say, if Abbe Gabriel can revoke the donation he has
      made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the notary was going to answer, Bathsheba reentered the room,
      followed by two more personages, who appeared in the Red Room at a little
      distance from each other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. A GOOD GENIUS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he first of the
      two, whose arrival had interrupted the answer of the notary, was
      Faringhea. At sight of this man&rsquo;s forbidding countenance, Samuel
      approached, and said to him: &ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After casting a piercing glance at Rodin, who started but soon recovered
      his habitual coolness, Faringhea replied to Samuel: &ldquo;Prince Djalma
      arrived lately from India, in order to be present here this day, as it was
      recommended to him by an inscription on a medal, which he wore about his
      neck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, also!&rdquo; cried Gabriel, who had been the shipmate of the
      Indian Prince from the Azores, where the vessel in which he came from
      Alexandria had been driven into port: &ldquo;he also one of the heirs! In
      fact, the prince told me during the voyage that his mother was of French
      origin. But, doubtless, he thought it right to conceal from me the object
      of his journey. Oh! that Indian is a noble and courageous young man. Where
      is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Strangler again looked at Rodin, and said, laying strong emphasis upon
      his words: &ldquo;I left the prince yesterday evening. He informed me
      that, although he had a great interest to be here, he might possibly
      sacrifice that interest to other motives. I passed the night in the same
      hotel, and this morning, when I went to call on him, they told me he was
      already gone out. My friendship for him led me to come hither, hoping the
      information I should be able to give might be of use to the prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In making no mention of the snare into which he had fallen the day before,
      in concealing Rodin&rsquo;s machinations with regard to Djalma, and in
      attributing the absence of this latter to a voluntary cause, the Strangler
      evidently wished to serve the socius, trusting that Rodin would know how
      to recompense his discretion. It is useless to observe, that all this
      story was impudently false. Having succeeded that morning in escaping from
      his prison by a prodigious effort of cunning, audacity, and skill, he had
      run to the hotel where he had left Djalma; there he had learned that a man
      and woman, of an advanced age, and most respectable appearance, calling
      themselves relations of the young Indian, had asked to see him&mdash;and
      that, alarmed at the dangerous state of somnolency in which he seemed to
      be plunged, they had taken him home in their carriage, in order to pay him
      the necessary attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfortunate,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;that this heir
      also did not make his appearance&mdash;but he has, unhappily, forfeited
      his right to the immense inheritance that is in question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! an immense inheritance is in question,&rdquo; said Faringhea,
      looking fixedly at Rodin, who prudently turned away his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second of the two personages we have mentioned entered at this moment.
      It was the father of Marshal Simon, an old man of tall stature, still
      active and vigorous for his age. His hair was white and thin. His
      countenance, rather fresh-colored, was expressive at once of quickness,
      mildness and energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola advanced hastily to meet him. &ldquo;You here, M. Simon!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy,&rdquo; said the marshal&rsquo;s father, cordially
      pressing Agricola&rsquo;s hand &ldquo;I have just arrived from my journey.
      M. Hardy was to have been here, about some matter of inheritance, as he
      supposed: but, as he will still be absent from Paris for some time, he has
      charged me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He also an heir!&mdash;M. Francis Hardy!&rdquo; cried Agricola,
      interrupting the old workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how pale and agitated you are, my boy!&rdquo; said the marshal&rsquo;s
      father, looking round with astonishment. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in despair, as he
      approached the foreman. &ldquo;The matter is that they would rob your
      granddaughters, and that I have brought them from the depths of Siberia
      only to witness this shameful deed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; cried the old workman, trying to recognize the soldiers
      face, &ldquo;you are then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;the generous, devoted friend of my son!&rdquo; cried the
      marshal&rsquo;s father, pressing the hands of Dagobert in his own with
      strong emotion; &ldquo;but did you not speak of Simon&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of his daughters; for he is more fortunate than he imagines,&rdquo;
      said Dagobert. &ldquo;The poor children are twins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are they?&rdquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a convent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; by the treachery of this man, who keeps them there in order to
      disinherit them.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;The Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son&rsquo;s mortal enemy!&rdquo; cried the old workman, as he
      threw a glance of aversion at Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, whose audacity did
      not fail him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not all,&rdquo; added Agricola. &ldquo;M. Hardy, my
      worthy and excellent master, has also lost his right to this immense
      inheritance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Marshal Simon&rsquo;s father; &ldquo;but M.
      Hardy did not know that such important interests were concerned. He set
      out hastily to join one of his friends who was in want of him.&rdquo;

    <p>
      At each of these successive revelations, Samuel felt his trouble increase:
      but he could only sigh over it, for the will of the testator was couched,
      unhappily, in precise and positive terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, impatient to end this scene, which caused him
      cruel embarrassment, in spite of his apparent calmness, said to the
      notary, in a grave and expressive voice: &ldquo;It is necessary, sir, that
      all this should have an end. If calumny could reach me, I would answer
      victoriously by the facts that have just come to light. Why attribute to
      odious conspiracies the absence of the heirs, in whose names this soldier
      and his son have so uncourteously urged their demands? Why should such
      absence be less explicable than the young Indian&rsquo;s, or than M. Hardy&rsquo;s,
      who, as his confidential man has just told us, did not even know the
      importance of the interests that called him hither? Is it not probable,
      that the daughters of Marshal Simon, and Mdlle. de Cardoville have been
      prevented from coming here to-day by some very natural reasons? But, once
      again, this has lasted too long. I think M. Notary will agree with me,
      that this discovery of new heirs does not at all affect the question,
      which I had the honor to propose to him just now; namely whether, as
      trustee for the poor, to whom Abbe Gabriel made a free gift of all he
      possessed, I remain notwithstanding his tardy and illegal opposition, the
      only possessor of this property, which I have promised, and which I now
      again promise, in presence of all here assembled, to employ for the
      Greater Glory of the Lord? Please to answer me plainly, M. Notary; and
      thus terminate the scene which must needs be painful to us all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the notary, in a solemn tone, &ldquo;on my soul
      and conscience, and in the name of law and justice&mdash;as a faithful and
      impartial executor of the last will of M. Marius de Rennepont, I declare
      that, by virtue of the deed of gift of Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont, you, M.
      l&rsquo;Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, are the only possessor of this property,
      which I place at your immediate disposal, that you may employ the same
      according to the intention of the donor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words pronounced with conviction and gravity, destroyed the last
      vague hopes that the representatives of the heirs might till then have
      entertained. Samuel became paler than usual, and pressed convulsively the
      hand of Bathsheba, who had drawn near to him. Large tears rolled down the
      cheeks of the two old people. Dagobert and Agricola were plunged into the
      deepest dejection. Struck with the reasoning of the notary, who refused to
      give more credence and authority to their remonstrances than the
      magistrates had done before him, they saw themselves forced to abandon
      every hope. But Gabriel suffered more than any one; he felt the most
      terrible remorse, in reflecting that, by his blindness, he had been the
      involuntary cause and instrument of this abominable theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when the notary, after having examined and verified the amount of
      securities contained in the cedar box, said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
      &ldquo;Take possession, sir, of this casket&mdash;&rdquo; Gabriel
      exclaimed, with bitter disappointment and profound despair: &ldquo;Alas!
      one would fancy, under these circumstances, that an inexorable fatality
      pursues all those who are worthy of interest, affection or respect. Oh, my
      God!&rdquo; added the young priest, clasping his hands with fervor,
      &ldquo;Thy sovereign justice will never permit the triumph of such
      iniquity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if heaven had listened to the prayer of the missionary. Hardly
      had he spoken, when a strange event took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for the end of Gabriel&rsquo;s invocation, Rodin,
      profiting by the decision of the notary, had seized the casket in his
      arms, unable to repress a deep aspiration of joy and triumph. At the very
      moment when Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and his socius thought themselves at
      last in safe possession of the treasure, the door of the apartment in
      which the clock had been heard striking was suddenly opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman appeared upon the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of her, Gabriel uttered a loud cry, and remained as if
      thunderstruck. Samuel and Bathsheba fell on their knees together, and
      raised their clasped hands. The Jew and Jewess felt inexplicable hopes
      reviving within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the other actors in this scene appeared struck with stupor. Rodin&mdash;Rodin
      himself&mdash;recoiled two steps, and replaced the casket on the table
      with a trembling hand. Though the incident might appear natural enough&mdash;a
      woman appearing on the threshold of a door, which she had just thrown open&mdash;there
      was a pause of deep and solemn silence. Every bosom seemed oppressed, and
      as if struggling for breath. All experienced, at sight of this woman,
      surprise mingled with fear, and indefinable anxiety&mdash;for this woman
      was the living original of the portrait, which had been placed in the room
      a hundred and fifty years ago. The same head-dress, the same flowing robe,
      the same countenance, so full of poignant and resigned grief! She advanced
      slowly, and without appearing to perceive the deep impression she had
      caused. She approached one of the pieces of furniture, inlaid with brass,
      touched a spring concealed in the moulding of gilded bronze, so that an
      upper drawer flew open, and taking from it a sealed parchment envelope,
      she walked up to the table, and placed this packet before the notary, who,
      hitherto silent and motionless, received it mechanically from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, casting upon Gabriel, who seemed fascinated by her presence, a long,
      mild, melancholy look, this woman directed her steps towards the hall, the
      door of which had remained open. As she passed near Samuel and Bathsheba,
      who were still kneeling, she stopped an instant, bowed her fair head
      towards them, and looked at them with tender solicitude. Then, giving them
      her hands to kiss, she glided away as slowly as she had entered&mdash;throwing
      a last glance upon Gabriel. The departure of this woman seemed to break
      the spell under which all present had remained for the last few minutes.
      Gabriel was the first to speak, exclaiming, in an agitated voice. &ldquo;It
      is she&mdash;again&mdash;here&mdash;in this house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, brother?&rdquo; said Agricola, uneasy at the pale and almost
      wild looks of the missionary; for the smith had not yet remarked the
      strange resemblance of the woman to the portrait, though he shared in the
      general feeling of amazement, without being able to explain it to himself.
      Dagobert and Faringhea were in a similar state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this woman?&rdquo; resumed Agricola, as he took the hand of
      Gabriel, which felt damp and icy cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the young priest. &ldquo;Those portraits have
      been there for more than a century and a half.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the paintings before which he was now seated, and Agricola,
      Dagobert, and Faringhea raised their eyes to either side of the fireplace.
      Three exclamations were now heard at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she&mdash;it is the same woman!&rdquo; cried the smith, in
      amazement, &ldquo;and her portrait has been here for a hundred and fifty
      years!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I see?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, as he gazed at the portrait
      of the man. &ldquo;The friend and emissary of Marshal Simon. Yes! it is
      the same face that I saw last year in Siberia. Oh, yes! I recognize that
      wild and sorrowful air&mdash;those black eyebrows, which make only one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes do not deceive me,&rdquo; muttered Faringhea to himself,
      shuddering with horror. &ldquo;It is the same man, with the black mark on
      his forehead, that we strangled and buried on the banks of the Ganges&mdash;the
      same man, that one of the sons of Bowanee told me, in the ruins of
      Tchandi, had been met by him afterwards at one of the gates of Bombay&mdash;the
      man of the fatal curse, who scatters death upon his passage&mdash;and his
      picture has existed for a hundred and fifty years!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, like Dagobert and Agricola, the stranger could not withdraw his eyes
      from that strange portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a mysterious resemblance!&rdquo; thought Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      Then, as if struck with a sudden idea, he said to Gabriel: &ldquo;But this
      woman is the same that saved your life in America?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, with emotion; &ldquo;and
      yet she told me she was going towards the North,&rdquo; added the young
      priest, speaking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how came she in this house?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      addressing Samuel. &ldquo;Answer me! did this woman come in with you, or
      before you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in first, and alone, when this door was first opened since a
      century and half,&rdquo; said Samuel, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can you explain the presence of this woman here?&rdquo;
      said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not try to explain it,&rdquo; said the Jew. &ldquo;I see, I
      believe, and now I hope.&rdquo; added he, looking at Bathsheba with an
      indefinable expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ought to explain the presence of this woman!&rdquo; said
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with vague uneasiness. &ldquo;Who is she? How
      came she hither?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know is, sir, that my father has often told me; there are
      subterraneous communications between this house and distant parts of the
      quarter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then nothing can be clearer,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;it only remains to be known what this woman intends by coming
      hither. As for her singular resemblance to this portrait, it is one of the
      freaks of nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin had shared in the general emotion, at the apparition of this
      mysterious woman. But when he saw that she had delivered a sealed packet
      to the notary, the socius, instead of thinking of the strangeness of this
      unexpected vision, was only occupied with a violent desire to quit the
      house with the treasure which had just fallen to the Company. He felt a
      vague anxiety at sight of the envelope with the black seal, which the
      protectress of Gabriel had delivered to the notary, and was still held
      mechanically in his hands. The socius, therefore, judging this a very good
      opportunity to walk off with the casket, during the general silence and
      stupor which still continued, slightly touched Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      elbow, made him a sign of intelligence, and, tucking the cedar-wood chest
      under his arm, was hastening towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, sir,&rdquo; said Samuel, rising, and standing in his
      path; &ldquo;I request M. Notary to examine the envelope, that has just
      been delivered to him. You may then go out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, trying to force a passage, &ldquo;the
      question is definitively decided in favor of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      Therefore, with your permission&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, sir,&rdquo; answered the old man, in a loud voice,
      &ldquo;that this casket shall not leave the house, until M. Notary has
      examined the envelope just delivered to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words drew the attention of all, Rodin was forced to retrace his
      steps. Notwithstanding the firmness of his character, the Jew shuddered at
      the look of implacable hate which Rodin turned upon him at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yielding to the wish of Samuel, the notary examined the envelope with
      attention. &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; he cried suddenly; &ldquo;what do I
      see?&mdash;Ah! so much the better!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this exclamation all eyes turned upon the notary. &ldquo;Oh! read,
      read, sir!&rdquo; cried Samuel, clasping his hands together. &ldquo;My
      presentiments have not then deceived me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to the notary, for he
      began to share in the anxiety of Rodin, &ldquo;what is this paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A codicil,&rdquo; answered the notary; &ldquo;a codicil, which
      reopens the whole question.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in a fury, as he
      hastily drew nearer to the notary, &ldquo;reopens the whole question! By
      what right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; added Rodin. &ldquo;We protest against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel! father! listen,&rdquo; cried Agricola, &ldquo;all is not
      lost. There is yet hope. Do you hear, Gabriel? There is yet hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; exclaimed the young priest, rising, and
      hardly believing the words of his adopted brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the notary; &ldquo;I will read to you the
      superscription of this envelope. It changes, or rather, it adjourns, the
      whole of the testamentary provisions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; cried Agricola, throwing himself on the neck of the
      missionary, &ldquo;all is adjourned, nothing is lost!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the notary; and he read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is a Codicil, which for reasons herein stated, adjourns
      and prorogues to the 1st day of June, 1832, though without any other
      change, all the provisions contained in the testament made by me, at one o&rsquo;clock
      this afternoon. The house shall be reclosed, and the funds left in the
      hands of the same trustee, to be distributed to the rightful claimants on
      the 1st of June, 1832.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Villetaneuse, this 13th of February, 1682, eleven o&rsquo;clock
      at night. &ldquo;&lsquo;MARIUS DE RENNEPONT.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest against this codicil as a forgery!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      livid with rage and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman who delivered it to the notary is a suspicious character,&rdquo;
      added Rodin. &ldquo;The codicil has been forged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the notary, severely; &ldquo;I have just
      compared the two signatures, and they are absolutely alike. For the rest&mdash;what
      I said this morning, with regard to the absent heirs, is now applicable to
      you&mdash;the law is open; you may dispute the authenticity of this
      codicil. Meanwhile, everything will remain suspended&mdash;since the term
      for the adjustment of the inheritance is prolonged for three months and a
      half.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the notary had uttered these last words, Rodin&rsquo;s nails dripped
      blood; for the first time, his wan lips became red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God! Thou hast heard and granted my prayer!&rdquo; cried
      Gabriel, kneeling down with religious fervor, and turning his angelic face
      towards heaven. &ldquo;Thy sovereign justice has not let iniquity triumph!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, my brave boy?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, who, in the
      first tumult of joy, had not exactly understood the meaning of the
      codicil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is put off, father!&rdquo; exclaimed the smith; &ldquo;the
      heirs will have three months and a half more to make their claim. And now
      that these people are unmasked,&rdquo; added Agricola, pointing to Rodin
      and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;we have nothing more to fear from
      them. We shall be on our guard; and the orphans, Mdlle. de Cardoville, my
      worthy master, M. Hardy, and this young Indian, will all recover their
      own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We must renounce the attempt to paint the delight, the transport of
      Gabriel and Agricola, of Dagobert, and Marshal Simon&rsquo;s father, of
      Samuel and Bathsheba. Faringhea alone remained in gloomy silence, before
      the portrait of the man with the black-barred forehead. As for the fury of
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin, when they saw Samuel retake possession
      of the casket, we must also renounce any attempt to describe it. On the
      notary&rsquo;s suggestion, who took with him the codicil, to have it
      opened according to the formalities of the law, Samuel agreed that it
      would be more prudent to deposit in the Bank of France the securities of
      immense value that were now known to be in his possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all the generous hearts, which had for a moment suffered so much,
      were overflowing with happiness, hope, and joy, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and Rodin quitted the house with rage and death in their souls. The
      reverend father got into his carriage, and said to his servants: &ldquo;To
      Saint-Dizier House!&rdquo;&mdash;Then, worn out and crushed, he fell back
      upon the seat, and hid his face in his hands, while he uttered a deep
      groan. Rodin sat next to him, and looked with a mixture of anger and
      disdain at this so dejected and broken-spirited man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coward!&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;He despairs&mdash;and
      yet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later, the carriage stopped in the Rue de Babylone,
      in the court-yard of Saint-Dizier House.

      CHAPTER XXVII. THE FIRST LAST, AND THE LAST FIRST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he carriage had
      travelled rapidly to Saint-Dizier House. During all the way, Rodin
      remained mute, contenting himself with observing Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      and listening to him, as he poured forth his grief and fury in a long
      monologue, interrupted by exclamations, lamentations, and bursts of rage,
      directed against the strokes of that inexorable destiny, which had ruined
      in a moment the best founded hopes. When the carriage entered the
      courtyard, and stopped before the portico, the princess&rsquo;s face could
      be seen through one of the windows, half hidden by the folds of a curtain;
      in her burning anxiety, she came to see if it was really Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      who arrived at the house. Still more, in defiance of all ordinary rules,
      this great lady, generally so scrupulous as to appearances, hurried from
      her apartment, and descended several steps of the staircase, to meet
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who was coming up with a dejected air. At sight
      of the livid and agitated countenance of the reverend father, the princess
      stopped suddenly, and grew pale. She suspected that all was lost. A look
      rapidly exchanged with her old lover left her no doubt of the issue she so
      much feared. Rodin humbly followed the reverend father, and both, preceded
      by the princess, entered the room. The door once closed, the princess,
      addressing Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, exclaimed with unspeakable anguish:
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering this question, the reverend father, his eyes
      sparkling with rage, his lips white, his features contracted, looked
      fixedly at the princess, and said to her: &ldquo;Do you know the amount of
      this inheritance, that we estimated at forty millions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; cried the princess; &ldquo;we have been
      deceived. The inheritance amounts to nothing, and all you have dare has
      been in vain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has indeed been in vain,&rdquo; answered the reverend
      father, grinding his teeth with rage; &ldquo;it was no question of forty
      millions, but of two hundred and twelve millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and twelve millions!&rdquo; repeated the princess in
      amazement, as she drew back a step. &ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I saw the vouchers, which were examined by the notary.&rdquo;

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and twelve millions?&rdquo; resumed the princess, with
      deep dejection. &ldquo;It is an immense and sovereign power&mdash;and you
      have renounced&mdash;you have not struggled for it, by every possible
      means, and till the last moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, I have done all that I could!&mdash;notwithstanding the
      treachery of Gabriel, who this very morning declared that he renounced us,
      and separated from the Society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful!&rdquo; said the princess, unaffectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deed of gift, which I had the precaution to have prepared by
      the notary, was in such good, legal form, that in spite of the objections
      of that accursed soldier and his son, the notary had put me in possession
      of the treasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and twelve millions!&rdquo; repeated the princess
      clasping her hands. &ldquo;Verily it is like a dream!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, bitterly, &ldquo;for
      us, this possession is indeed a dream, for a codicil has been discovered,
      which puts off for three months and a half all the testamentary
      provisions. Now that our very precautions have roused the suspicion of all
      these heirs&mdash;now that they know the enormous amount at stake&mdash;they
      will be upon their guard; and all is lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is the wretch that produced this codicil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some wandering creature, that Gabriel says he met in America, where
      she saved his life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how could this woman be there&mdash;how could she know the
      existence of this codicil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was all arranged with a miserable Jew, the guardian of
      the house, whose family has had charge of the funds for three generations;
      he had no doubt some secret instructions, in case he suspected the
      detention of any of the heirs, for this Marius de Rennepont had foreseen
      that our Company would keep their eyes upon his race.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you not dispute the validity of this codicil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, go to law in these times&mdash;litigate about a will&mdash;incur
      the certainty of a thousand clamors, with no security for success?&mdash;It
      is bad enough, that even this should get wind. Alas! it is terrible. So
      near the goal! after so much care and trouble. An affair that had been
      followed up with so much perseverance during a century and a half!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and twelve millions!&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;The
      Order would have had no need to look for establishments in foreign
      countries; with such resources, it would have been able to impose itself
      upon France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with bitterness;
      &ldquo;by means of education, we might have possessed ourselves of the
      rising generation. The power is altogether incalculable.&rdquo; Then,
      stamping with his foot, he resumed: &ldquo;I tell you, that it is enough
      to drive one mad with rage! an affair so wisely, ably, patiently
      conducted!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that Gabriel may not revoke his donation, in as far as
      concerns himself. That alone would be a considerable sum&mdash;not less
      than thirty millions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enormous&mdash;it is almost what you hoped,&rdquo; said the
      princess; &ldquo;then why despair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is evident that Gabriel will dispute this donation.
      However legal it may be, he will find means to annul it, now that he is
      free, informed as to our designs, and surrounded by his adopted family. I
      tell you, that all is lost. There is no hope left. I think it will be even
      prudent to write to Rome, to obtain permission to leave Paris for a while.
      This town is odious to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I see that no hope is left&mdash;since you, my friend,
      have decided almost to fly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny was completely discouraged and broken down; this
      terrible blow had destroyed all life and energy within him. He threw
      himself back in an arm-chair, quite overcome. During the preceding
      dialogue, Rodin was standing humbly near the door, with his old hat in his
      hand. Two or three times, at certain passages in the conversation between
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and the princess, the cadaverous face of the
      socius, whose wrath appeared to be concentrated, was slightly flushed, and
      his flappy eyelids were tinged with red, as if the blood mounted in
      consequence of an interior struggle; but, immediately after, his dull
      countenance resumed its pallid blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must write instantly to Rome, to announce this defeat, which has
      become an event of the first importance, because it overthrows immense
      hopes,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, much depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend father had remained seated; pointing to a table, he said to
      Rodin, with an abrupt and haughty air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The socius placed his hat on the ground, answered with a respectful bow
      the command, and with stooping head and slanting walk, went to seat
      himself on a chair, that stood before a desk. Then, taking pen and paper,
      he waited, silent and motionless, for the dictation of his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your permission, princess?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      to Madame de Saint-Dizier. The latter answered by an impatient wave of the
      hand, as if she reproached him for the formal demand at such a time. The
      reverend father bowed, and dictated these words in a hoarse and hollow
      voice: &ldquo;All our hopes, which of late had become almost certainties,
      have been suddenly defeated. The affair of the Rennepont inheritance, in
      spite of all the care and skill employed upon it, has completely and
      finally failed. At the point to which matters had been brought, it is
      unfortunately worse than a failure; it is a most disastrous event for the
      Society, which was clearly entitled to this property, fraudulently
      withdrawn from a confiscation made in our favor. My conscience at least
      bears witness, that, to the last moment, I did all that was possible to
      defend and secure our rights. But I repeat, we must consider this
      important affair as lost absolutely and forever, and think no more about
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus dictating, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s back was turned towards
      Rodin. At a sudden movement made by the socius, in rising and throwing his
      pen upon the table, instead of continuing to write, the reverend father
      turned round, and, looking at Rodin with profound astonishment, said to
      him: &ldquo;Well! what are you doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to end this&mdash;the man is mad!&rdquo; said Rodin to
      himself, as he advanced slowly towards the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you quit your place&mdash;you cease writing?&rdquo; said the
      reverend father, in amazement. Then, addressing the princess, who shared
      in his astonishment, he added, as he glanced contemptuously at the socius,
      &ldquo;He is losing his senses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive him,&rdquo; replied Mme. de Saint-Dizier; &ldquo;it is, no
      doubt, the emotion caused by the ruin of this affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the princess, return to your place, and continue to write,&rdquo;
      said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to Rodin, in a tone of disdainful compassion,
      as, with imperious finger, he pointed to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socius, perfectly indifferent to this new order, approached the
      fireplace, drew himself up to his full height as he turned his arched
      back, planted himself firmly on his legs, stamped on the carpet with the
      heel of his clumsy, greasy shoes, crossed his hands beneath the flaps of
      his old, spotted coat, and, lifting his head, looked fixedly at Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      The socius had not spoken a word, but his hideous countenance, now
      flushed, suddenly revealed such a sense of his superiority, and such
      sovereign contempt for Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, mingled with so calm and
      serene a daring, that the reverend father and the princess were quite
      confounded by it. They felt themselves overawed by this little old man, so
      sordid and so ugly. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny knew too well the customs of
      the Company, to believe his humble secretary capable of assuming so
      suddenly these airs of transcendent superiority without a motive, or
      rather, without a positive right. Late, too late, the reverend father
      perceived, that this subordinate agent might be partly a spy, partly an
      experienced assistant, who, according to the constitutions of the Order,
      had the power and mission to depose and provisionally replace, in certain
      urgent cases, the incapable person over whom he was stationed as a guard.
      The reverend father was not deceived. From the general to the provincials,
      and to the rectors of the colleges, all the superior members of the Order
      have stationed near them, often without their knowledge, and in apparently
      the lowest capacities, men able to assume their functions at any given
      moment, and who, with this view, constantly keep up a direct
      correspondence with Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment Rodin had assumed this position, the manners of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      generally so haughty, underwent a change. Though it cost him a good deal,
      he said with hesitation, mingled with deference: &ldquo;You have, no
      doubt, the right to command me&mdash;who hitherto have commanded.&rdquo;
      Rodin, without answering, drew from his well-rubbed and greasy pocket-book
      a slip of paper, stamped upon both sides, on which were written several
      lines in Latin. When he had read it, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny pressed this
      paper respectfully, even religiously, to his lips: then returned it to
      Rodin, with a low bow. When he again raised his head, he was purple with
      shame and vexation. Notwithstanding his habits of passive obedience and
      immutable respect for the will of the Order, he felt a bitter and violent
      rage at seeing himself thus abruptly deposed from power. That was not all.
      Though, for a long time past, all relations in gallantry had ceased
      between him and Mme. de Saint-Dizier, the latter was not the less a woman;
      and for him to suffer this humiliation in presence of a woman was,
      undoubtedly, cruel, as, notwithstanding his entrance into the Order, he
      had not wholly laid aside the character of man of the world. Moreover, the
      princess, instead of appearing hurt and offended by this sudden
      transformation of the superior into a subaltern, and of the subaltern into
      a superior, looked at Rodin with a sort of curiosity mingled with
      interest. As a woman&mdash;as a woman, intensely ambitious, seeking to
      connect herself with every powerful influence&mdash;the princess loved
      this strange species of contrast. She found it curious and interesting to
      see this man, almost in rags, mean in appearance, and ignobly ugly, and
      but lately the most humble of subordinates look down from the height of
      his superior intelligence upon the nobleman by birth, distinguished for
      the elegance of his manners, and just before so considerable a personage
      in the Society. From that moment, as the more important personage of the
      two, Rodin completely took the place of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny in the
      princess&rsquo;s mind. The first pang of humiliation over, the reverend
      father, though his pride bled inwardly, applied all his knowledge of the
      world to behave with redoubled courtesy towards Rodin, who had become his
      superior by this abrupt change of fortune. But the ex-socius, incapable of
      appreciating, or rather of acknowledging, such delicate shades of manner,
      established himself at once, firmly, imperiously, brutally, in his new
      position, not from any reaction of offended pride, but from a
      consciousness of what he was really worth. A long acquaintance with Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny had revealed to him the inferiority of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You threw away your pen,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to
      Rodin with extreme deference, &ldquo;while I was dictating a note for
      Rome. Will you do me the favor to tell me how I have acted wrong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly,&rdquo; replied Rodin, in his sharp, cutting voice.
      &ldquo;For a long time this affair appeared to me above your strength; but
      I abstained from interfering. And yet what mistakes! what poverty of
      invention; what coarseness in the means employed to bring it to bear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly understand your reproaches,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      mildly, though a secret bitterness made its way through his apparent
      submission. &ldquo;Was not the success certain, had it not been for this
      codicil? Did you not yourself assist in the measures that you now blame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You commanded, then, and it was my duty to obey. Besides, you were
      just on the point of succeeding&mdash;not because of the means you had
      taken&mdash;but in spite of those means, with all their awkward and
      revolting brutality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;you are severe,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just. One has to be prodigiously clever, truly, to shut up any
      one in a room, and then lock the door! And yet, what else have you done?
      The daughters of General Simon?&mdash;imprisoned at Leipsic, shut up in a
      convent at Paris! Adrienne de Cardoville?&mdash;placed in confinement.
      Sleepinbuff&mdash;put in prison. Djalma?&mdash;quieted by a narcotic. One
      only ingenious method, and a thousand times safer, because it acted
      morally, not materially, was employed to remove M. Hardy. As for your
      other proceedings&mdash;they were all bad, uncertain, dangerous. Why?
      Because they were violent, and violence provokes violence. Then it is no
      longer a struggle of keen, skillful, persevering men, seeing through the
      darkness in which they walk, but a match of fisticuffs in broad day.
      Though we should be always in action, we should always shrink from view;
      and yet you could find no better plan than to draw universal attention to
      us by proceedings at once open and deplorably notorious. To make them more
      secret, you call in the guard, the commissary of police, the jailers, for
      your accomplices. It is pitiable, sir; nothing but the most brilliant
      success could cover such wretched folly; and this success has been
      wanting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, deeply hurt, for the
      Princess de Saint Dizier, unable to conceal the sort of admiration caused
      in her by the plain, decisive words of Rodin, looked at her old lover,
      with an air that seemed to say, &ldquo;He is right;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;sir,
      you are more than severe in your judgment; and, notwithstanding the
      deference I owe to you, I must observe, that I am not accustomed&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many other things to which you are not accustomed,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, harshly interrupting the reverend father; &ldquo;but you will
      accustom yourself to them. You have hitherto had a false idea of your own
      value. There is the old leaven of the soldier and the worlding fermenting
      within you, which deprives your reason of the coolness, lucidity, and
      penetration that it ought to possess. You have been a fine military
      officer, brisk and gay, foremost in wars and festivals, with pleasures and
      women. These things have half worn you out. You will never be anything but
      a subaltern; you have been thoroughly tested. You will always want that
      vigor and concentration of mind which governs men and events. That vigor
      and concentration of mind I have&mdash;and do you know why? It is because,
      solely devoted to the service of the Company, I have always been ugly,
      dirty, unloved, unloving&mdash;I have all my manhood about me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In pronouncing these words, full of cynical pride, Rodin was truly
      fearful. The princess de Saint-Dizier thought him almost handsome by his
      energy and audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, feeling himself overawed, invincibly and
      inexorably, by this diabolical being, made a last effort to resist and
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! sir, these boastings are no proofs of valor and
      power. We must see you at work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Rodin, coldly; &ldquo;do you know at what work?&rdquo;
      Rodin was fond of this interrogative mode of expression. &ldquo;Why, at
      the work that you so basely abandon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Princess de Saint-Dizier; for Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      stupefied at Rodin&rsquo;s audacity, was unable to utter a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, slowly, &ldquo;that I undertake to
      bring to a good issue this affair of the Rennepont inheritance, which
      appears to you so desperate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they have unmasked our maneuvers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better; we shall be obliged to invent others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they; will suspect us in everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better; the success that is difficult is the most
      certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you hope to make Gabriel consent not to revoke his
      donation, which is perhaps illegal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to bring in to the coffers of the Company the whole of the
      two hundred and twelve millions, of which they wish to cheat us. Is that
      clear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is clear&mdash;but impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you that it is, and must be possible. Do you not
      understand, short-sighted as you are!&rdquo; cried Rodin, animated to such
      a degree that his cadaverous face became slightly flushed; &ldquo;do you
      not understand that it is no longer in our choice to hesitate? Either
      these two hundred and twelve millions must be ours&mdash;and then the
      re-establishment of our sovereign influence in France is sure&mdash;for,
      in these venal times, with such a sum at command, you may bribe or
      overthrow a government, or light up the flame of civil war, and restore
      legitimacy, which is our natural ally, and, owing all to us, would give us
      all in return&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is clear,&rdquo; cried the princess, clasping her hands in
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, on the contrary,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;these two hundred
      and twelve millions fall into the hands of the family of the Renneponts,
      it will be our ruin and our destruction. We shall create a stock of bitter
      and implacable enemies. Have you not heard the execrable designs of that
      Rennepont, with regard to the association he recommends, and which, by an
      accursed fatality, his race are just in a condition to realize? Think of
      the forces that would rally round these millions. There would be Marshal
      Simon, acting in the name of his daughters&mdash;that is, the man of the
      people become a duke, without being the vainer for it, which secures his
      influence with the mob, because military spirit and Bonapartism still
      represent, in the eyes of the French populace, the traditions of national
      honor and glory. There would be Francis Hardy, the liberal, independent,
      enlightened citizen, the type of the great manufacturer, the friend of
      progress, the benefactor of his workmen. There would be Gabriel&mdash;the
      good priest, as they say!&mdash;the apostle of the primitive gospel, the
      representative of the democracy of the church, of the poor country curate
      as opposed to the rich bishop, the tiller of the vine as opposed to him
      who sits in the shade of it; the propagator of all the ideas of
      fraternity, emancipation, progress&mdash;to use their own jargon&mdash;and
      that, not in the name of revolutionary and incendiary politics, but in the
      name of a religion of charity, love, and peace&mdash;to speak as they
      speak. There, too, would be Adrienne de Cardoville, the type of elegance,
      grace, and beauty, the priestess of the senses, which she deifies by
      refining and cultivating them. I need not tell you of her wit and
      audacity; you know them but too well. No one could be more dangerous to us
      than this creature, a patrician in blood, a plebeian in heart, a poet in
      imagination. Then, too, there would be Prince Djalma, chivalrous, bold,
      ready for adventure, knowing nothing of civilized life, implacable in his
      hate as in his affection, a terrible instrument for whoever can make use
      of him. In this detestable family, even such a wretch as Sleepinbuff, who
      in himself is of no value, raised and purified by the contact of these
      generous and far from narrow natures (as they call them), might represent
      the working class, and take a large share in the influence of that
      association. Now do you not think that if all these people, already
      exasperated against us, because (as they say) we have wished to rob them,
      should follow the detestable counsels of this Rennepont&mdash;should unite
      their forces around this immense fortune, which would strengthen them a
      hundred-fold&mdash;do you not think that, if they declare a deadly war
      against us, they will be the most dangerous enemies that we have ever had?
      I tell you that the Company has never been in such serious peril; yes, it
      is now a question of life and death. We must no longer defend ourselves,
      but lead the attack, so as to annihilate this accursed race of Rennepont,
      and obtain possession of these millions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this picture, drawn by Rodin with a feverish animation, which had only
      the more influence from its unexpectedness, the princess and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      looked at each other in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said the reverend father to Rodin, &ldquo;I had
      not considered all the dangerous consequences of this association,
      recommended by M. de Rennepont. I believe that the heir, from the
      characters we know them to be possessed of, would wish to realize this
      Utopia. The peril is great and pressing; what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir? You have to act upon ignorant, heroic, enthusiastic
      natures like Djalma&rsquo;s&mdash;sensual and eccentric characters like
      Adrienne de Cardoville&rsquo;s&mdash;simple and ingenuous minds like Rose
      and Blanche Simon&rsquo;s&mdash;honest and frank dispositions like Francis
      Hardy&rsquo;s&mdash;angelic and pure souls like Gabriel&rsquo;s&mdash;brutal
      and stupid instincts like Jacques&mdash;and can you ask, &lsquo;What is to
      be done?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it. Your past conduct shows as much,&rdquo; replied
      Rodin, contemptuously. &ldquo;You have had recourse to the lowest and most
      mechanical contrivances, instead of acting upon the noble and generous
      passions, which, once united, would constitute so formidable a bond; but
      which, now divided and isolated, are open to every surprise, every
      seduction, every attack! Do you, at length understand me? Not yet?&rdquo;
      added Rodin, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;Answer me&mdash;do people die
      of despair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May not the gratitude of successful love reach the last limits of
      insane generosity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May there not be such horrible deceptions, that suicide is the only
      refuge from frightful realities?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May not the excess of sensuality lead to the grave by a slow and
      voluptuous agony?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there not in life such terrible circumstances that the most
      worldly, the firmest, the most impious characters, throw themselves
      blindly, overwhelmed with despair, into the arms of religion, and abandon
      all earthly greatness for sackcloth, and prayers, and solitude?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there not a thousand occasions in which the reaction of the
      passions works the most extraordinary changes, and brings about the most
      tragic catastrophes in the life of man and woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! why ask me, &lsquo;What is to be done?&rsquo; What
      would you say, for example, if before three months are over, the most
      dangerous members of this family of the Renneponts should come to implore,
      upon their knees, admission to that very Society which they now hold in
      horror, and from which Gabriel has just separated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a conversion is impossible,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible? What were you, sir, fifteen years ago?&rdquo; said
      Rodin. &ldquo;An impious and debauched man of the world. And yet you came
      to us, and your wealth became ours. What! we have conquered princes,
      kings, popes; we have absorbed and extinguished in our unity magnificent
      intelligences, which, from afar, shone with too dazzling a light; we have
      all but governed two worlds; we have perpetuated our Society, full of
      life, rich and formidable, even to this day, through all the hate, and all
      the persecutions that have assailed us; and yet we shall not be able to
      get the better of a single family, which threatens our Company, and has
      despoiled us of a large fortune? What! we are not skillful enough to
      obtain this result without having recourse to awkward and dangerous
      violence? You do not know, then, the immense field that is thrown open by
      the mutually destructive power of human passions, skillfully combined,
      opposed, restrained, excited?&mdash;particularly,&rdquo; added Rodin, with
      a strange smile, &ldquo;when, thanks to a powerful ally, these passions
      are sure to be redoubled in ardor and energy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ally?&rdquo; asked Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who, as well as
      the Princess de Saint-Dizier, felt a sort of admiration mixed with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, without answering the reverend father;
      &ldquo;this formidable ally, who comes to our assistance, may bring about
      the most astonishing transformations&mdash;make the coward brave, and the
      impious credulous, and the gentle ferocious&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this ally!&rdquo; cried the Princess, oppressed with a vague
      sense of fear. &ldquo;This great and formidable ally&mdash;who is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he comes,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, still impassible, &ldquo;the
      youngest and most vigorous, every moment in danger of death, will have no
      advantage over the sick man at his last gasp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is this ally?&rdquo; exclaimed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      more and more alarmed, for as the picture became darker, Rodin&rsquo;s
      face become more cadaverous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ally, who can decimate a population, may carry away with him
      in the shroud that he drags at his heels, the whole of an accursed race;
      but even he must respect the life of that great intangible body, which
      does not perish with the death of its members&mdash;for the spirit of the
      Society of Jesus is immortal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this ally?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this ally,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;who advances with slow
      steps, and whose terrible coming is announced by mournful presentiments&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cholera!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, pronounced by Rodin in an abrupt voice, made the Princess and
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny grow pale and tremble. Rodin&rsquo;s look was
      gloomy and chilling, like a spectre&rsquo;s. For some moments, the silence
      of the tomb reigned in the saloon. Rodin was the first to break it. Still
      impassible, he pointed with imperious gesture to the table, where a few
      minutes before he had himself been humbly seated, and said in a sharp
      voice to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;Write!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend father started at first with surprise; then, remembering that
      from a superior he had become an inferior, he rose, bowed lowly to Rodin,
      as he passed before him, seated himself at the table, took the pen, and
      said, &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin dictated, and the reverend Father wrote as follows: &ldquo;By the
      mismanagement of the Reverend Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, the affair of the
      inheritance of the Rennepont family has been seriously compromised. The
      sum amounts to two hundred and twelve millions. Notwithstanding the check
      we have received, we believe we may safely promise to prevent these
      Renneponts from injuring the Society, and to restore the two hundred and
      twelve millions to their legitimate possessors. We only ask for the most
      complete and extensive powers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour after this scene, Rodin left Saint Dizier House,
      brushing with his sleeve the old greasy hat, I which he had pulled off to
      return the salute of the porter by a very low bow.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE STRANGER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following scene
      took place on the morrow of the day in which Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had
      been so rudely degraded by Rodin to the subaltern position formerly
      occupied by the socius.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well known that the Rue Clovis is one of the most solitary streets
      in the Montagne St. Genevieve district. At the epoch of this narrative,
      the house No. 4, in this street, was composed of one principal building,
      through which ran a dark passage, leading to a little, gloomy court, at
      the end of which was a second building, in a singularly miserable and
      dilapidated condition. On the ground-floor, in front of the house, was a
      half-subterraneous shop, in which was sold charcoal, fagots, vegetables,
      and milk. Nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning had just struck. The mistress
      of the shop, one Mother Arsene, an old woman of a mild, sickly
      countenance, clad in a brown stuff dress, with a red bandanna round her
      head, was mounted on the top step of the stairs which led down to her
      door, and was employed in setting out her goods&mdash;that is, on one side
      of her door she placed a tin milk-can, and on the other some bunches of
      stale vegetables, flanked with yellowed cabbages. At the bottom of the
      steps, in the shadowy depths of the cellar, one could see the light of the
      burning charcoal in a little stove. This shop situated at the side of the
      passage, served as a porter&rsquo;s lodge, and the old woman acted as
      portress. On a sudden, a pretty little creature, coming from the house,
      entered lightly and merrily the shop. This young girl was Rose-Pompon, the
      intimate friend of the Bacchanal Queen.&mdash;Rose-Pompon, a widow for the
      moment, whose bacchanalian cicisbeo was Ninny Moulin, the orthodox
      scapegrace, who, on occasion, after drinking his fill, could transform
      himself into Jacques Dumoulin, the religious writer, and pass gayly from
      dishevelled dances to ultramontane polemics, from Storm-blown Tulips to
      Catholic pamphlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose-Pompon had just quitted her bed, as appeared by the negligence of her
      strange morning costume; no doubt, for want of any other head-dress, on
      her beautiful light hair, smooth and well-combed, was stuck jauntily a
      foraging-cap, borrowed from her masquerading costume. Nothing could be
      more sprightly than that face, seventeen years old, rosy, fresh, dimpled,
      and brilliantly lighted up by a pair of gay, sparkling blue eyes. Rose
      Pompon was so closely enveloped from the neck to the feet in a red and
      green plaid cloak, rather faded, that one could guess the cause of her
      modest embarrassment. Her naked feet, so white that one could not tell if
      she wore stockings or not, were slipped into little morocco shoes, with
      plated buckles. It was easy to perceive that her cloak concealed some
      article which she held in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Rose-Pompon,&rdquo; said Mother Arsene with a kindly air;
      &ldquo;you are early this morning. Had you no dance last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it, Mother Arsene; I had no heart to dance.
      Poor Cephyse&mdash;the Bacchanal Queen&mdash;has done nothing but cry all
      night. She cannot console herself, that her lover should be in prison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, my girl,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;I must
      speak to you about your friend Cephyse. You won&rsquo;t be angry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I ever angry?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, shrugging her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that M. Philemon will scold me on his return?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scold you! what for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of his rooms, that you occupy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mother Arsene, did not Philemon tell you, that, in his
      absence, I was to be as much mistress of his two rooms as I am of himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not speak of you, but of your friend Cephyse, whom you have
      also brought to occupy M. Philemon&rsquo;s lodgings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where would she have gone without me, my good Mother Arsene?
      Since her lover was arrested, she has not dared to return home, because
      she owes ever so many quarters. Seeing her troubles. I said to her:
      &lsquo;Come, lodge at Philemon&rsquo;s. When he returns, we must find
      another place for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, little lovey&mdash;if you only assure me that M. Philemon
      will not be angry&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry! for what? That we spoil his things? A fine set of things he
      has to spoil! I broke his last cup yesterday&mdash;and am forced to fetch
      the milk in this comic concern.&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      So saying, laughing with all her might, Rose-Pompon drew her pretty little
      white arm from under her cloak, and presented to Mother Arsene one of
      those champagne glasses of colossal capacity, which hold about a bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said the greengrocer in amazement; &ldquo;it is
      like a glass trumpet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Philemon&rsquo;s grand gala-glass, which they gave him when
      he took his degrees in boating,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think you must put your milk in it&mdash;I am really
      ashamed,&rdquo; said Mother Arsene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I! If I were to meet any one on the stairs, holding this
      glass in my hand like a Roman candlestick, I should burst out laughing,
      and break the last remnant of Philemon&rsquo;s bazaar, and he would give
      me his malediction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no danger that you will meet any one. The first-floor is
      gone out, and the second gets up very late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of lodgers,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;is there not a
      room to let on the second-floor in the rear house? It might do for
      Cephyse, when Philemon comes back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is a little closet in the roof&mdash;just over the two
      rooms of the mysterious old fellow,&rdquo; said Mother Arsene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Father Charlemagne. Have you found out anything more about
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, no, my girl! only that he came this morning at break of
      day, and knocked at my shutters. &lsquo;Have you received a letter for me,
      my good lady?&rsquo; said he&mdash;for he is always so polite, the dear
      man!&mdash;&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said I.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well, then,
      pray don&rsquo;t disturb yourself, my good lady!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I
      will call again.&rsquo; And so he went away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he never sleep in the house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. No doubt, he lodges somewhere else&mdash;but he passes some
      hours here, once every four or five days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And always comes alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure? Does he never manage to slip in some little
      puss of a woman? Take care, or Philemon will give you notice to quit,&rdquo;
      said Rose-Pompon, with an air of mock-modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Charlemagne with a woman! Oh, poor dear man!&rdquo; said the
      greengrocer, raising her hands to heaven; &ldquo;if you saw him, with his
      greasy hat, his old gray coat, his patched umbrella, and his simple face,
      he looks more like a saint than anything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, Mother Arsene, what does the saint do here, all alone for
      hours, in that hole at the bottom of the court, where one can hardly see
      at noon-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I ask myself, my dovey, what can he be doing? It
      can&rsquo;t be that he comes to look at his furniture, for he has nothing
      but a flock bed, a table, a stove, a chair, and an old trunk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat in the style of Philemon&rsquo;s establishment,&rdquo;
      said Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, notwithstanding that, Rosey, he is as much afraid that any
      one should come into his room, as if we were all thieves, and his
      furniture was made of massy gold. He has had a patent lock put on the
      door, at his own expense; he never leaves me his key; and he lights his
      fire himself, rather than let anybody into his room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say he is old?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fifty or sixty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ugly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fancy, little viper&rsquo;s eyes, looking as if they had been
      bored with a gimlet, in a face as pale as death&mdash;so pale, that the
      lips are white. That&rsquo;s for his appearance. As for his character, the
      good old man&rsquo;s so polite!&mdash;he pulls off his hat so often, and
      makes you such low bows, that it is quite embarrassing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, to come back to the point,&rdquo; resumed Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;what
      can he do all alone in those two rooms? If Cephyse should take the closet,
      on Philemon&rsquo;s return, we may amuse ourselves by finding out
      something about it. How much do they want for the little room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is in such bad condition, that I think the landlord would
      let it go for fifty or fifty-five francs a-year, for there is no room for
      a stove, and the only light comes through a small pane in the roof.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Cephyse!&rdquo; said Rose, sighing, and shaking her head
      sorrowfully. &ldquo;After having amused herself so well, and flung away so
      much money with Jacques Rennepont, to live in such a place, and support
      herself by hard work! She must have courage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed, there is a great difference between that closet and
      the coach-and-four in which Cephyse came to fetch you the other day, with
      all the fine masks, that looked so gay&mdash;particularly the fat man in
      the silver paper helmet, with the plume and the top boots. What a jolly
      fellow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Ninny Moulin. There is no one like him to dance the forbidden
      fruit. You should see him with Cephyse, the Bacchanal Queen. Poor
      laughing, noisy thing!&mdash;the only noise she makes now is crying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! these young people&mdash;these young people!&rdquo; said the
      greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, Mother Arsene; you were young once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know. I have always thought myself much the same as I am
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your lovers, Mother Arsene?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovers! Oh, yes! I was too ugly for that&mdash;and too well taken
      care of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother looked after you, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my girl; but I was harnessed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harnessed!&rdquo; cried Rose-Pompon, in amazement, interrupting the
      dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;harnessed to a water-cart, along with my brother. So,
      you see, when we had drawn like a pair of horses for eight or ten hours a
      day, I had no heart to think of nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mother Arsene, what a hard life,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the winter, when it froze, it was hard enough. I and my brother
      were obliged to be rough-shod, for fear of slipping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a trade for a woman! It breaks one&rsquo;s heart. And they
      forbid people to harness dogs!&rdquo; added Rose-Pompon,
      sententiously.(21)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, &lsquo;tis true,&rdquo; resumed Mother Arsene. &ldquo;Animals
      are sometimes better off than people. But what would you have? One must
      live, you know. As you make your bed, you must lie. It was hard enough,
      and I got a disease of the lungs by it&mdash;which was not my fault. The
      strap, with which I was harnessed, pressed so hard against my chest, that
      I could scarcely breathe: so I left the trade, and took to a shop, which
      is just to tell you, that if I had had a pretty face and opportunity, I
      might have done like so many other young people, who begin with laughter
      and finish&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a laugh t&rsquo;other side of the mouth&mdash;you would say;
      it is true, Mother Arsene. But, you see, every one has not the courage to
      go into harness, in order to remain virtuous. A body says to herself, you
      must have some amusement while you are young and pretty&mdash;you will not
      always be seventeen years old&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;the
      world will end, or you will get married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, perhaps, it would have been better to begin by that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but one is too stupid; one does not know how to catch the men,
      or to frighten them. One is simple, confiding, and they only laugh at us.
      Why, Mother Arsene, I am myself an example that would make you shudder;
      but &lsquo;tis quite enough to have had one&rsquo;s sorrows, without
      fretting one&rsquo;s self at the remembrance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my beauty! you, so young and gay, have had sorrows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mother Arsene! I believe you. At fifteen and a half I began to
      cry, and never left off till I was sixteen. That was enough, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They deceived you, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did worse. They treated me as they have treated many a poor
      girl, who had no more wish to go wrong than I had. My story is not a three
      volume one. My father and mother are peasants near Saint-Valery, but so
      poor&mdash;so poor, that having five children to provide for, they were
      obliged to send me, at eight years old, to my aunt, who was a charwoman
      here in Paris. The good woman took me out of charity, and very kind it was
      of her, for I earned but little. At eleven years of age she sent me to
      work in one of the factories of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. I don&rsquo;t
      wish to speak, ill of the masters of these factories; but what do they
      care, if little boys and girls are mixed up pell-mell with young men and
      women of eighteen to twenty? Now you see, there, as everywhere, some are
      no better than they should be; they are not particular in word or deed,
      and I ask you, what art example for the children, who hear and see more
      than you think for. Then, what happens? They get accustomed as they grow
      older, to hear and see things, that afterwards will not shock them at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say there is true, Rose-Pompon. Poor children! who takes
      any trouble about them?&mdash;not their father or mother, for they are at
      their daily work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mother Arsene, it is all very well; it is easy to cry
      down a young girl that has gone wrong; but if they knew all the ins and
      outs, they would perhaps pity rather than blame her. To come back to
      myself&mdash;at fifteen years old I was tolerably pretty. One day I had
      something to ask of the head clerk. I went to him in his private room. He
      told me he would grant what I wanted, and even take me under his
      patronage, if I would listen to him; and he began by trying to kiss me. I
      resisted. Then he said to me:&mdash;&lsquo;You refuse my offer? You shall
      have no more work; I discharge you from the factory.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the wicked man!&rdquo; said Mother Arsene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went home all in tears, and my poor aunt encouraged me not to
      yield, and she would try to place me elsewhere. Yes&mdash;but it was
      impossible; the factories were all full. Misfortunes never come single; my
      aunt fell ill, and there was not a sou in the house; I plucked up my
      courage, and returned to entreat the mercy of the clerk at the factory.
      Nothing would do. &lsquo;So much the worse,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;you are
      throwing away your luck. If you had been more complying, I should perhaps
      have married you.&rsquo; What could I do, Mother Arsene?&mdash;misery was
      staring me in the face; I had no work; my aunt was ill; the clerk said he
      would marry me&mdash;I did like so many others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when, afterwards, you spoke to him about marriage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he laughed at me, and in six months left me. Then I wept
      all the tears in my body, till none remained&mdash;then I was very ill&mdash;and
      then&mdash;I console myself, as one may console one&rsquo;s self for
      anything. After some changes, I met with Philemon. It is upon him that I
      revenge myself for what others have done to me. I am his tyrant,&rdquo;
      added Rose-Pompon, with a tragic air, as the cloud passed away which had
      darkened her pretty face during her recital to Mother Arsene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the latter thoughtfully. &ldquo;They
      deceive a poor girl&mdash;who is there to protect or defend her? Oh! the
      evil we do does not always come from ourselves, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spy Ninny Moulin!&rdquo; cried Rose-Pompon, interrupting the
      greengrocer, and pointing to the other side of the street. &ldquo;How
      early abroad! What can he want with me?&rdquo; and Rose wrapped herself
      still more closely and modestly in her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Jacques Dumoulin, who advanced with his hat stuck on one
      side, with rubicund nose and sparkling eye, dressed in a loose coat, which
      displayed the rotundity of his abdomen. His hands, one of which held a
      huge cane shouldered like a musket, were plunged into the vast pockets of
      his outer garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he reached the threshold of the door, no doubt with the intention
      of speaking to the portress, he perceived Rose-Pompon. &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed, &ldquo;my pupil already stirring? That is fortunate. I came
      on purpose to bless her at the rise of morn!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Ninny Moulin advanced with open arms towards Rose-Pompon who
      drew back a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, ungrateful child!&rdquo; resumed the writer on divinity.
      &ldquo;Will you refuse me the morning&rsquo;s paternal kiss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept paternal kisses from none but Philemon. I had a letter
      from him yesterday, with a jar of preserves, two geese, a bottle of
      home-made brandy, and an eel. What ridiculous presents! I kept the drink,
      and changed the rest for two darling live pigeons, which I have installed
      in Philemon&rsquo;s cabinet, and a very pretty dove-cote it makes me. For
      the rest, my husband is coming back with seven hundred francs, which he
      got from his respectable family, under pretence of learning the bass viol,
      the cornet-a-piston, and the speaking trumpet, so as to make his way in
      society, and a slap-up marriage&mdash;to use your expression&mdash;my good
      child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear pupil, we will taste the family brandy, and enjoy
      ourselves in expectation of Philemon and his seven hundred francs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Ninny Moulin slapped the pockets of his waistcoat, which gave
      forth a metallic sound, and added: &ldquo;I come to propose to you to
      embellish my life, to-day and to-morrow, and even the day after, if your
      heart is willing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the announcements are decent and fraternal, my heart does not
      say no.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied; I will act by you as your grandfather, your great
      grandfather, your family portrait. We will have a ride, a dinner, the
      play, a fancy dress ball, and a supper afterwards. Will that suit you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On condition that poor Cephyse is to go with us. It will raise her
      spirits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cephyse shall be of the party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come into a fortune, great apostle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than that, most rosy and pompous of all Rose-Pom, pons! I am
      head editor of a religious journal; and as I must make some appearance in
      so respectable a concern, I ask every month for four weeks in advance, and
      three days of liberty. On this condition, I consent to play the saint for
      twenty-seven days out of thirty, and to be always as grave and heavy as
      the paper itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A journal! that will be something droll, and dance forbidden steps
      all alone on the tables of the cafes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be droll enough; but not for everybody. They are rich
      sacristans, who pay the expenses. They don&rsquo;t look to money, provided
      the journal bites, tears, burns, pounds, exterminates and destroys. On my
      word of honor, I shall never have been in such a fury!&rdquo; added Ninny
      Moulin, with a loud, hoarse laugh. &ldquo;I shall wash the wounds of my
      adversaries with venom of the finest vintage, and gall of the first
      quality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For his peroration, Ninny Moulin imitated the pop of uncorking a bottle of
      champagne&mdash;which made Rose-Pompon laugh heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; resumed she, &ldquo;will be the name of your
      journal of sacristans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be called &lsquo;Neighborly Love.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! that is a very pretty name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little! there is a second title.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Neighborly Love; or, the Exterminator of the Incredulous,
      the Indifferent, the Lukewarm, and Others,&rsquo; with this motto from the
      great Bossuet: &lsquo;Those who are not for us are against us.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Philemon says in the battles at the Chaumiere, when he
      shakes his cane.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which proves, that the genius of the Eagle of Meaux is universal. I
      only reproach him for having been jealous of Moliere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! actor&rsquo;s jealousy,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty girl!&rdquo; cried Ninny Moulin, threatening her with his
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you are going to exterminate Madame de la Sainte-Colombo,
      who is somewhat lukewarm&mdash;how about your marriage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My journal will advance it, on the contrary. Only think! editor-In
      chief is a superb position; the sacristans will praise, and push, and
      support, and bless me; I shall get La-Sainte-Colombe&mdash;and then, what
      a life I&rsquo;ll lead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, a postman entered the shop, and delivered a letter to the
      greengrocer, saying: &ldquo;For M. Charlemagne, post-paid!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon; &ldquo;it is for the little mysterious
      old man, who has such extraordinary ways. Does it come from far?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you; it comes from Italy, from Rome,&rdquo; said Ninny
      Moulin, looking in his turn at the letter, which the greengrocer held in
      her hand. &ldquo;Who is the astonishing little old man of whom you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just imagine to yourself, my great apostle,&rdquo; said
      Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;a little old man, who has two rooms at the bottom of
      that court. He never sleeps there, but comes from time to time, and shuts
      himself up for hours, without ever allowing any one to enter his lodging,
      and without any one knowing what he does there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a conspirator,&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, laughing, &ldquo;or
      else a comer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear man,&rdquo; said Mother Arsene, &ldquo;what has he done
      with his false money? He pays me always in sous for the bit of bread and
      the radish I furnish him for his breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the name of this mysterious chap?&rdquo; asked
      Dumoulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Charlemagne,&rdquo; said the greengrocer. &ldquo;But look,
      surely one speaks of the devil, one is sure to see his horns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the horns?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, by the side of the house&mdash;that little old man, who
      walks with his neck awry, and his umbrella under his arm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin!&rdquo; ejaculated Ninny Moulin, retreating hastily, and
      descending three steps into the shop, in order not to be seen. Then he
      added. &ldquo;You say, that this gentleman calls himself&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Charlemagne&mdash;do you know him?&rdquo; asked the greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil does he do here, under a false name?&rdquo; said
      Jacques Dumoulin to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, with impatience. &ldquo;You
      are quite confused.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this gentleman has two rooms in this house, and comes here
      mysteriously,&rdquo; said Jacques Dumoulin, more and more surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Rose-Pompon; &ldquo;you can see his windows
      from Philemon&rsquo;s dove-cote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! quick! let me go into the passage, that I may not meet him,&rdquo;
      said Dumoulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, without having been perceived by Rodin, he glided from the shop into
      the passage, and thence mounted to the stairs, which led to the apartment
      occupied by Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, M. Charlemagne,&rdquo; said Mother Arsene to Rodin,
      who made his appearance on the threshold. &ldquo;You come twice in a day;
      that is right, for your visits are extremely rare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too polite, my good lady,&rdquo; said Rodin, with a very
      courteous bow; and he entered the shop of the greengrocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      (21) There are, really, ordinances, full of a touching interest for the
      canine race, which forbid the harnessing of dogs.

      CHAPTER XXIX. THE DEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>odin&rsquo;s
      countenance, when he entered Mother Arsene&rsquo;s shop, was expressive of
      the most simple candor. He leaned his hands on the knob of his umbrella,
      and said: &ldquo;I much regret, my good lady, that I roused you so early
      this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not come often enough, my dear sir, for me to find fault
      with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it, my good lady? I live in the country, and only
      come hither from time to time to settle my little affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of that sir, the letter you expected yesterday has arrived
      this morning. It is large, and comes from far. Here it is,&rdquo; said the
      greengrocer, drawing it from her pocket; &ldquo;it cost nothing for
      postage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear lady,&rdquo; said Rodin, taking the letter with
      apparent indifference, and putting it into the side-pocket of his
      great-coat, which he carefully buttoned over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going up to your rooms, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my good, lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will get ready your little provisions,&rdquo; said Mother
      Arsene; &ldquo;as usual, I suppose, my dear sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be ready in the twinkling of an eye, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the greengrocer took down an old basket; after throwing into it
      three or four pieces of turf, a little bundle of wood, and some charcoal,
      she covered all this fuel with a cabbage leaf; then, going to the further
      end of the shop, she took from a chest a large round loaf, cut off a
      slice, and selecting a magnificent radish with the eye of a connoisseur,
      divided it in two, made a hole in it, which she filled with gray salt
      joined the two pieces together again, and placed it carefully by the side
      of the bread, on the cabbage leaf which separated the eatables from the
      combustibles. Finally, taking some embers from the stove, she put them
      into a little earthen pot, containing ashes, which she placed also in the
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, reascending to her top step, Mother Arsene said to Rodin: &ldquo;Here
      is your basket, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, my good lady,&rdquo; answered Rodin, and
      plunging his hand into the pocket of his trousers, he drew forth eight
      sous, which he counted out only one by one to the greengrocer, and said to
      her, as he carried off his store: &ldquo;Presently, when I come down
      again, I will return your basket as usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite at your service, my dear sir, quite at your service,&rdquo;
      said Mother Arsene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin tucked his umbrella under his left arm, took up the greengrocer&rsquo;s
      basket with his right hand, entered the dark passage, crossed the little
      court and mounted with light step to the second story of a dilapidated
      building; there, drawing a key from his pocket, he opened a door, which he
      locked carefully after him. The first of the two rooms which he occupied
      was completely unfurnished, as for the second, it is impossible to imagine
      a more gloomy and miserable den. Papering so much worn, torn and faded,
      that no one could recognize its primitive color, bedecked the walls. A
      wretched flock-bed, covered with a moth-fretted blanket; a stool, and a
      little table of worm-eaten wood; an earthenware stove, as cracked as old
      china; a trunk with a padlock, placed under the bed&mdash;such was the
      furniture of this desolate hole. A narrow window, with dirty panes, hardly
      gave any light to this room, which was almost deprived of air by the
      height of the building in front; two old cotton pocket handkerchiefs,
      fastened together with pins, and made to slide upon a string stretched
      across the window, served for curtains. The plaster of the roof, coming
      through the broken and disjointed tiles, showed the extreme neglect of the
      inhabitant of this abode. After locking his door, Rodin threw his hat and
      umbrella on the bed, placed his basket on the ground, set the radish and
      bread on the table, and kneeling down before his stove, stuffed it with
      fuel, and lighted it by blowing with vigorous lungs on the embers
      contained in his earthen pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, to use the consecrated expression, the stove began to draw, Rodin
      spread out the handkerchiefs, which served him for curtains; then,
      thinking himself quite safe from every eye, he took from the side-pocket
      of his great-coat the letter that Mother Arsene had given him. In doing
      so, he brought out several papers and different articles; one of these
      papers, folded into a thick and rumpled packet, fell upon the table, and
      flew open. It contained a silver cross of the Legion of Honor, black with
      time. The red ribbon of this cross had almost entirely lost its original
      color. At sight of this cross, which he replaced in his pocket with the
      medal of which Faringhea had despoiled Djalma, Rodin shrugged his
      shoulders with a contemptuous and sardonic air; then, producing his large
      silver watch, he laid it on the table by the side of the letter from Rome.
      He looked at this letter with a singular mixture of suspicion and hope, of
      fear, and impatient curiosity. After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, he
      prepared to unseal the envelope; but suddenly he threw it down again upon
      the table, as if, by a strange caprice, he had wished to prolong for a few
      minutes that agony of uncertainty, as poignant and irritating as the
      emotion of the gambler.

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20287.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Looking at his watch, Rodin resolved not to open the letter, until the
      hand should mark half-past nine, of which it still wanted seven minutes.
      In one of those whims of puerile fatalism, from which great minds have not
      been exempt, Rodin said to himself: &ldquo;I burn with impatience to open
      this letter. If I do not open it till half-past nine, the news will be
      favorable.&rdquo; To employ these minutes, Rodin took several turns up and
      down the room, and stood in admiring contemplation before two old prints,
      stained with damp and age, and fastened to the wall by rusty nails. The
      first of these works of art&mdash;the only ornaments with which Rodin had
      decorated this hole&mdash;was one of those coarse pictures, illuminated
      with red, yellow, green, and blue, such as are sold at fairs; an Italian
      inscription announced that this print had been manufactured at Rome. It
      represented a woman covered with rags, bearing a wallet, and having a
      little child upon her knees; a horrible hag of a fortune-teller held in
      her hands the hand of the little child, and seemed to read there his
      future fate, for these words in large blue letters issued from her mouth:
      &ldquo;Sara Papa&rdquo; (he shall be Pope).
    </p>
    <p>
      The second of these works of art, which appeared to inspire Rodin with
      deep meditations, was an excellent etching, whose careful finish and bold,
      correct drawing, contrasted singularly with the coarse coloring of the
      other picture. This rare and splendid engraving, which had cost Rodin six
      louis (an enormous expense for him), represented a young boy dressed in
      rags. The ugliness of his features was compensated by the intellectual
      expression of his strongly marked countenance. Seated on a stone,
      surrounded by a herd of swine, that he seemed employed in keeping, he was
      seen in front, with his elbow resting on his knee, and his chin in the
      palm of his hand. The pensive and reflective attitude of this young man,
      dressed as a beggar, the power expressed in his large forehead, the
      acuteness of his penetrating glance, and the firm lines of the mouth,
      seemed to reveal indomitable resolution, combined with superior
      intelligence and ready craft. Beneath this figure, the emblems of the
      papacy encircled a medallion, in the centre of which was the head of an
      old man, the lines of which, strongly marked, recalled in a striking
      manner, notwithstanding their look of advanced age, the features of the
      young swineherd. This engraving was entitled THE YOUTH of SIXTUS V.; the
      color print was entitled The Prediction.(22)
    </p>
    <p>
      In contemplating these prints more and more nearly, with ardent and
      inquiring eye, as though he had asked for hopes or inspirations from them,
      Rodin had come so close that, still standing, with his right arm bent
      behind his head, he rested, as it were, against the wall, whilst, hiding
      his left hand in the pocket of his black trousers, he thus held back one
      of the flaps of his olive great-coat. For some minutes, he remained in
      this meditative attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, as we have said, came seldom to this lodging; according to the
      rules of his Order, he had till now lived with Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      whom he was specially charged to watch. No member of the Society,
      particularly in the subaltern position which Rodin had hitherto held,
      could either shut himself in, or possess an article of furniture made to
      lock. By this means nothing interferes with the mutual spy-system,
      incessantly carried on, which forms one of the most powerful resources of
      the Company of Jesus. It was on account of certain combinations, purely
      personal to himself, though connected on some points with the interests of
      the Order, that Rodin, unknown to all, had taken these rooms in the Rue
      Clovis. And it was from the depths of this obscure den that the socius
      corresponded directly with the most eminent and influential personages of
      the sacred college. On one occasion, when Rodin wrote to Rome, that Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny, having received orders to quit France without seeing his
      dying mother, had hesitated to set out, the socius had added, in form of
      postscriptum, at the bottom of the letter denouncing to the General of the
      Order the hesitation of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the Prince Cardinal that he may rely upon me, but I hope for
      his active aid in return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This familiar manner of corresponding with the most powerful dignitary of
      the Order, the almost patronizing tone of the recommendation that Rodin
      addressed to the Prince Cardinal, proved that the socius, notwithstanding
      his apparently subaltern position, was looked upon, at that epoch, as a
      very important personage, by many of the Princes of the Church, who wrote
      to him at Paris under a false name, making use of a cipher and other
      customary precautions. After some moments passed in contemplation, before
      the portrait of Sixtus V., Rodin returned slowly to the table, on which
      lay the letter, which, by a sort of superstitious delay, he had deferred
      opening, notwithstanding his extreme curiosity. As it still wanted some
      minutes of half-past nine, Rodin, in order not to lose time, set about
      making preparations for his frugal breakfast. He placed on the table, by
      the side of an inkstand, furnished with pens, the slice of bread and the
      radish; then seating himself on his stool, with the stove, as it were,
      between his legs, he drew a horn-handled knife from his pocket, and
      cutting alternately a morsel of bread and a morsel of radish, with a
      sharp, well-worn blade, he began his temperate repast with a vigorous
      appetite, keeping his eye fixed on the hand of his watch. When it reached
      the momentous hour, he unsealed the envelope with a trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained two letters. The first appeared to give him little
      satisfaction; for, after some minutes, he shrugged his shoulders, struck
      the table impatiently with the handle of his knife, disdainfully pushed
      aside the letter with the back of his dirty hand, and perused the second
      epistle, holding his bread in one hand, and with the other mechanically
      dipping a slice of radish into the gray salt spilt on a corner of the
      table. Suddenly, Rodin&rsquo;s hand remained motionless. As he progressed
      in his reading, he appeared more and more interested, surprised, and
      struck. Rising abruptly, he ran to the window, as if to assure himself, by
      a second examination of the cipher, that he was not deceived. The news
      announced to him in the letter seemed to be unexpected. No doubt, Rodin
      found that he had deciphered correctly, for, letting fall his arms, not in
      dejection, but with the stupor of a satisfaction as unforeseen as
      extraordinary, he remained for some time with his head down, and his eyes
      fixed&mdash;the only mark of joy that he gave being manifested by a loud,
      frequent, and prolonged respiration. Men who are as audacious in their
      ambition, as they are patient and obstinate in their mining and
      countermining, are surprised at their own success, when this latter
      precedes and surpasses their wise and prudent expectations. Rodin was now
      in this case. Thanks to prodigies of craft, address, and dissimulation,
      thanks to mighty promises of corruption, thanks to the singular mixture of
      admiration, fear, and confidence, with which his genius inspired many
      influential persons, Rodin now learned from members of the pontifical
      government, that, in case of a possible and probable occurrence, he might,
      within a given time, aspire, with a good chance of success, to a position
      which has too often excited the fear, the hate, or the envy of many
      sovereigns, and which has in turn, been occupied by great, good men, by
      abominable scoundrels, and by persons risen from the lowest grades of
      society. But for Rodin to attain this end with certainty, it was
      absolutely necessary for him to succeed in that project, which he had
      undertaken to accomplish without violence, and only by the play and the
      rebound of passions skillfully managed. The project was: To secure for the
      Society of Jesus the fortune of the Rennepont family.
    </p>
    <p>
      This possession would thus have a double and immense result; for Rodin,
      acting in accordance with his personal views, intended to make of his
      Order (whose chief was at his discretion) a stepping-stone and a means of
      intimidation. When his first impression of surprise had passed away&mdash;an
      impression that was only a sort of modesty of ambition and self
      diffidence, not uncommon with men of really superior powers&mdash;Rodin
      looked more coldly and logically on the matter, and almost reproached
      himself for his surprise. But soon after, by a singular contradiction,
      yielding to one of those puerile and absurd ideas, by which men are often
      carried away when they think themselves alone and unobserved, Rodin rose
      abruptly, took the letter which had caused him such glad surprise, and
      went to display it, as it were, before the eyes of the young swineherd in
      the picture: then, shaking his head proudly and triumphantly, casting his
      reptile-glance on the portrait, he muttered between his teeth, as he
      placed his dirty finger on the pontifical emblem: &ldquo;Eh, brother? and
      I also&mdash;perhaps!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this ridiculous interpolation, Rodin returned to his seat, and, as
      if the happy news he had just received had increased his appetite, he
      placed the letter before him, to read it once more, whilst he exercised
      his teeth, with a sort of joyous fury, on his hard bread and radish,
      chanting an old Litany.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something strange, great, and, above all, frightful, in the
      contrast afforded by this immense ambition, already almost justified by
      events, and contained, as it were, in so miserable an abode. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      (who, if not a very superior man, had at least some real value, was a
      person of high birth, very haughty, and placed in the best society) would
      never have ventured to aspire to what Rodin thus looked to from the first.
      The only aim of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and even this he thought
      presumptuous, was to be one day elected General of his Order&mdash;that
      Order which embraced the world. The difference of the ambitious aptitudes
      of these two personages is conceivable. When a man of eminent abilities,
      of a healthy and vivacious nature, concentrates all the strength of his
      mind and body upon a single point, remaining, like Rodin, obstinately
      chaste and frugal, and renouncing every gratification of the heart and the
      senses&mdash;the man, who revolts against the sacred designs of his
      Creator, does so almost always in favor of some monstrous and devouring
      passion&mdash;some infernal divinity, which, by a sacrilegious pact, asks
      of him, in return for the bestowal of formidable power, the destruction of
      every noble sentiment, and of all those ineffable attractions and tender
      instincts with which the Maker, in His eternal wisdom and inexhaustible
      munificence, has so paternally endowed His creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the scene that we have just described, Rodin had not perceived that
      the curtain of a window on the third story of the building opposite had
      been partially drawn aside, and had half-revealed the sprightly face of
      Rose-Pompon, and the Silenus-like countenance of Ninny Moulin. It ensued
      that Rodin, notwithstanding his barricade of cotton handkerchiefs, had not
      been completely sheltered from the indiscreet and curious examination of
      the two dancers of the Storm-blown Tulip.
    </p>
    <p>
      (22) According to the tradition, it was predicted to the mother of Sixtus
      V., that he would be pope; and, in his youth, he is said to have kept
      swine.

    <p>
      Though Rodin had experienced much surprise on reading the second letter
      from Rome, he did not choose that his answer should betray any such
      amazement. Having finished his frugal breakfast, he took a sheet of paper,
      and rapidly wrote in cipher the following note, in the short, abrupt style
      that was natural to him when not obliged to restrain himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The information does not surprise me. I had foreseen it all.
      Indecision and cowardice always bear such fruit. This is not enough.
      Heretical Russia murders Catholic Poland. Rome blesses the murderers, and
      curses the victims.(23)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In return, Russia guarantees to Rome, by Austria, the bloody
      suppression of the patriots of Romagna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too, is well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cut-throat band of good Cardinal Albani is not sufficient for
      the massacre of the impious liberals. They are weary of the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so well. They must go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rodin had written these last words, his attention was suddenly
      attracted by the clear and sonorous voice of Rose-Pompon, who, knowing her
      Beranger by heart, had opened Philemon&rsquo;s window, and, seated on the
      sill, sang with much grace and prettiness this verse of the immortal
      song-writer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;How wrong you are! Is&rsquo;t you dare say
   That heaven ever scowls on earth?
   The earth that laughs up to its blue,
   The earth that owes it joy and birth?
   Oh, may the wine from vines it warms,
   May holy love thence fluttering down,
   Lend my philosophy their charms,
   To drive away care&rsquo;s direful frown!
   So, firm let&rsquo;s stand,
   Full glass in hand,
   And all evoke
   The God of honest folk!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This song, in its divine gentleness, contrasted so strangely with the cold
      cruelty of the few lines written by Rodin, that he started and bit his
      lips with rage, as he recognized the words of the great poet, truly
      Christian, who had dealt such rude blows to the false Church. Rodin waited
      for some moments with angry impatience, thinking the voice would continue;
      but Rose-Pompon was silent, or only continued to hum, and soon changed to
      another air, that of the Good Pope, which she entoned, but without words.
      Rodin, not venturing to look out of his window to see who was this
      troublesome warbler, shrugged his shoulders, resumed his pen, and
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To it again. We must exasperate the independent spirits in all
      countries&mdash;excite philosophic rage all over Europe make liberalism
      foam at the mouth&mdash;raise all that is wild and noisy against Rome. To
      effect this, we must proclaim in the face of the world these three
      propositions. 1. It is abominable to assert that a man may be saved in any
      faith whatever, provided his morals be pure. 2. It is odious and absurd to
      grant liberty of conscience to the people. 3. The liberty of the press
      cannot be held in too much horror.24
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must bring the Pap-fed man to declare these propositions in
      every respect orthodox&mdash;show him their good effect upon despotic
      governments&mdash;upon true Catholics, the muzzlers of the people. He will
      fall into the snare. The propositions once published, the storm will burst
      forth. A general rising against Rome&mdash;a wide schism&mdash;the sacred
      college divided into three parties. One approves&mdash;the other blames&mdash;the
      third trembles. The Sick Man, still more frightened than he is now at
      having allowed the destruction of Poland, will shrink from the clamors,
      reproaches, threats, and violent ruptures that he has occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well&mdash;and goes far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, set the Pope to shaking the conscience of the Sick Man, to
      disturb his mind, and terrify his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To sum up. Make everything bitter to him&mdash;divide his council&mdash;isolate
      him&mdash;frighten him&mdash;redouble the ferocious ardor of good Albini&mdash;revive
      the appetite of the Sanfedists(25)&mdash;give them a gulf of liberals&mdash;let
      there be pillage, rape, massacre, as at Cesena&mdash;a downright river of
      Carbonaro blood&mdash;the Sick Man will have a surfeit of it. So many
      butcheries in his name&mdash;he will shrink, be sure he will shrink&mdash;every
      day will have its remorse, every night its terror, every minute its
      anguish; and the abdication he already threatens will come at last&mdash;perhaps
      too soon. That is now the only danger; you must provide against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case of an abdication, the grand penitentiary has understood me.
      Instead of confiding to a general the direction of our Order, the best
      militia of the Holy See, I should command it myself. Thenceforward this
      militia would give me no uneasiness. For instance: the Janissaries and the
      Praetorian Guards were always fatal to authority&mdash;why?&mdash;because
      they were able to organize themselves as defenders of the government,
      independently of the government; hence their power of intimidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clement XIV. was a fool. To brand and abolish our Company was an
      absurd fault. To protect and make it harmless, by declaring himself the
      General of the Order, is what he should have done. The Company, then at
      his mercy, would have consented to anything. He would have absorbed us,
      made us vassals of the Holy See, and would no longer have had to fear our
      services. Clement XIV. died of the cholic. Let him heed who hears. In a
      similar case, I should not die the same death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, the clear and liquid voice of Rose-Pompon was again heard.
      Rodin bounded with rage upon his seat; but soon, as he listened to the
      following verse, new to him (for, unlike Philemon&rsquo;s widow, he had
      not his Beranger at his fingers&rsquo; ends), the Jesuit, accessible to
      certain odd, superstitious notions, was confused and almost frightened at
      so singular a coincidence. It is Beranger&rsquo;s Good Pope who speaks&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;What are monarchs? sheepish sots!
   Or they&rsquo;re robbers, puffed with pride,
   Wearing badges of crime blots,
   Till their certain graves gape wide.
   If they&rsquo;ll pour out coin for me,
   I&rsquo;ll absolve them&mdash;skin and bone!
   If they haggle&mdash;they shall see,
   My nieces dancing on their throne!
   So laugh away!
   Leap, my fay!
   Only watch one hurt the thunder
   First of all by Zeus under,
   I&rsquo;m the Pope, the whole world&rsquo;s wonder!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Rodin, half-risen from his chair, with outstretched neck and attentive
      eye, was still listening, when Rose-Pompon, flitting like a bee from
      flower to flower of her repertoire, had already begun the delightful air
      of Colibri. Hearing no more, the Jesuit reseated himself, in a sort of
      stupor; but, after some minutes&rsquo; reflection, his countenance again
      brightened up, and he seemed to see a lucky omen in this singular
      incident. He resumed his pen, and the first words he wrote partook, as it
      were, of this strange confidence in fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had more hope of success than at this moment. Another
      reason to neglect nothing. Every presentiment demands redoubled zeal. A
      new thought occurred to me yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall act here in concert. I have founded an ultra-Catholic
      paper called Neighborly Love. From its ultramontane, tyrannical,
      liberticidal fury, it will be thought the organ of Rome. I will confirm
      these reports. They will cause new terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall raise the question of the liberty of instruction. The raw
      liberals will support us. Like fools, they admit us to equal rights; when
      our privileges, our influence of the confessional, our obedience to Rome,
      all place us beyond the circle of equal rights, by the advantages which we
      enjoy. Double fools! they think us disarmed, because they have disarmed
      themselves towards us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A burning question&mdash;irritating clamors&mdash;new cause of
      disgust for the Weak Man. Every little makes a mickle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also is very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To sum up all in two words. The end is abdication&mdash;the means,
      vexation, incessant torture. The Rennepont inheritance wilt pay for the
      election. The price agreed, the merchandise will be sold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin here paused abruptly, thinking he had heard some noise at that door
      of his, which opened on the staircase; therefore he listened with
      suspended breath; but all remaining silent, he thought he must have been
      deceived, and took up his pen:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care of the Rennepont business&mdash;the hinge on which
      will turn our temporal operations. We must begin from the foundation&mdash;substitute
      the play of interests, and the springs of passion, for the stupid club law
      of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. He nearly compromised everything&mdash;and yet
      he has good parts, knows the world, has powers of seduction, quick insight&mdash;but
      plays ever in a single key, and is not great enough to make himself
      little. In his stead, I shall know how to make use of him. There is good
      stuff in the man. I availed myself in time of the full powers given by the
      R. F. G.; I may inform Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in case of need, of the
      secret engagements taken by the General towards myself. Until now, I have
      let him invent for this inheritance the destination that you know of. A
      good thought, but unseasonable. The same end, by other means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The information was false. There are over two hundred millions.
      Should the eventuality occur, what was doubtful must become certain. An
      immense latitude is left us. The Rennepont business is now doubly mine,
      and within three months, the two hundred millions will be ours, by the
      free will of the heirs themselves. It must be so; for this failing, the
      temporal part would escape me, and my chances be diminished by one half. I
      have asked for full powers; time presses, and I act as if I had them. One
      piece of information is indispensable for the success of my projects. I
      expect it from you, and I must have it; do you understand me? The powerful
      influence of your brother at the Court of Vienna will serve you in this. I
      wish to have the most precise details as to the present position of the
      Duke de Reichstadt&mdash;the Napoleon II. of the Imperialists. Is it
      possible, by means of your brother, to open a secret correspondence with
      the prince, unknown to his attendants?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to this promptly. It is urgent. This note will be sent off to
      day. I shall complete it to-morrow. It will reach you, as usual, by the
      hands of the petty shopkeeper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Rodin was sealing this letter within a double envelope,
      he thought that he again heard a noise at the door. He listened. After
      some silence, several knocks were distinctly audible. Rodin started. It
      was the first time any one had knocked at his door, since nearly a
      twelve-month that he occupied this room. Hastily placing the letter in his
      great-coat pocket, the Jesuit opened the old trunk under his bed, took
      from it a packet of papers wrapped in a tattered cotton handkerchief,
      added to them the two letters in cipher he had just received, and
      carefully relocked the trunk. The knocking continued without, and seemed
      to show more and more impatience. Rodin took the greengrocer&rsquo;s
      basket in his hand, tucked his umbrella under his arm, and went with some
      uneasiness to ascertain who was this unexpected visitor. He opened the
      door, and found himself face to face with Rose-Pompon, the troublesome
      singer, and who now, with a light and pretty courtesy, said to him in the
      most guileless manner in the world, &ldquo;M. Rodin, if you please?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (23) On page 110 of Lamennais&rsquo; Affaires de Rome, will be seen the
      following admirable scathing of Rome by the most truly evangelical spirit
      of our age: &ldquo;So long as the issue of the conflict between Poland and
      her oppressors remained in the balances, the papal official organ
      contained not one word to offend the so long victorious nation; but hardly
      had she gone down under the Czar&rsquo;s atrocious vengeance, and the long
      torture of a whole land doomed to rack, and exile, and servitude began,
      than this same journal found no language black enough to stain those whom
      fortune had fled. Yet it is wrong to charge this unworthy insult to papal
      power; it only cringes to the law which Russia lays down to it, when it
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you want to keep your own bones unbroken, bide where you
      are, beside the scaffold, and, as the victims pass, hoot at them!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (24) See Pope Gregory XVI.&lsquo;s Encyclical Letter to the Bishops in
      France, 1832.
    </p>
    <p>
      (25) Hardly had the Sixteenth Gregory ascended the pontifical throne, than
      news came of the rising in Bologna. His first idea was to call the
      Austrians, and incite the Sanfedist volunteer bands of fanatics. Cardinal
      Albini defeated the liberals at Cesena, where his followers pillaged
      churches, sacked the town, and ill-treated women. At Forli, cold-blooded
      murders were committed. In 1832 the Sanfedists (Holy Faithites) openly
      paraded their medals, bearing the heads of the Duke of Modena and the
      Pope; letters issued by the apostolic confederation; privileges and
      indulgences. They took the following oath: &ldquo;I. A. B., vow to rear
      the throne and altar over the bones of infamous freedom shriekers, and
      exterminate these latter without pity for children&rsquo;s cries and women&rsquo;s
      tears.&rdquo; The disorders perpetrated by these marauders went beyond all
      bounds; the Romish Court regularized anarchy and organized the Sanfedists
      into volunteer corps, to which fresh privileges were granted. (Revue deux
      Mondes, Nov. 15th, 1844.&mdash;&ldquo;La Revolution en Italie.&rdquo;)

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>otwithstanding his
      surprise and uneasiness, Rodin did not frown. He began by locking his door
      after him, as he noticed the young girl&rsquo;s inquisitive glance. Then
      he said to her good-naturedly, &ldquo;Who do you want, my dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin,&rdquo; repeated Rose-Pompon, stoutly, opening her bright
      blue eyes to their full extent, and looking Rodin full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; said he, moving towards the stairs.
      &ldquo;I do not know him. Inquire above or below.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t! giving yourself airs at your age!&rdquo; said
      Rose-Pompon, shrugging her shoulders. &ldquo;As if we did not know that
      you are M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charlemagne,&rdquo; said the socius, bowing; &ldquo;Charlemagne, to
      serve you&mdash;if I am able.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not able,&rdquo; answered Rose-Pompon, majestically; then
      she added with a mocking air, &ldquo;So, we have our little pussy-cat
      hiding-places; we change our name; we are afraid Mamma Rodin will find us
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear child,&rdquo; said the socius, with a paternal smile;
      &ldquo;you have come to the right quarter. I am an old man, but I love
      youth&mdash;happy, joyous youth! Amuse yourself, pray, at my expense. Only
      let me pass, for I am in a hurry.&rdquo; And Rodin again advanced towards
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, in a solemn voice, &ldquo;I have
      very important things to say to you, and advice to ask about a love
      affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, little madcap that you are! have you nobody to tease in your
      own house, that you must come here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lodge in this house, M. Rodin,&rdquo; answered Rose-Pompon,
      laying a malicious stress on the name of her victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Oh, dear, only to think I did not know I had such a pretty
      neighbor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have lodged here six months, M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the third story, front, M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you, then, that sang so well just now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me great pleasure, I must say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very polite, M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lodge, I suppose, with your respectable family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, M. Rodin,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, casting down her
      eyes with a timid air. &ldquo;I lodge with Grandpapa Philemon, and
      Grandmamma Bacchanal&mdash;who is a queen and no mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin had hitherto been seriously uneasy, not knowing in what manner Rose
      had discovered his real name. But on hearing her mention the Bacchanal
      queen, with the information that she lodged in the house, he found
      something to compensate for the disagreeable incident of Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s
      appearance. It was, indeed, important to Rodin to find out the Bacchanal
      Queen, the mistress of Sleepinbuff, and the sister of Mother Bunch, who
      had been noted as dangerous since her interview with the superior of the
      convent, and the part she had taken in the projected escape of Mdlle. de
      Cardoville. Moreover, Rodin hoped&mdash;thanks to what he had just heard&mdash;to
      bring Rose-Pompon to confess to him the name of the person from whom she
      had learned that &ldquo;Charlemagne&rdquo; masked &ldquo;Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the young girl pronounced the name of the Bacchanal queen, than
      Rodin clasped his hands, and appeared as much surprised as interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear child,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I conjure you not to
      jest on this subject. Are you speaking of a young girl who bears that
      nickname, the sister of a deformed needlewoman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, the Bacchanal Queen is her nickname,&rdquo; said
      Rose-Pompon, astonished in her turn; &ldquo;she is really Cephyse
      Soliveau, and she is my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she is your friend?&rdquo; said Rodin, reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, my bosom friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you love her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a sister. Poor girl! I do what I can for her, and that&rsquo;s
      not much. But how comes it that a respectable man of your age should know
      the Bacchanal Queen?&mdash;Ah! that shows you have a false name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I am no longer inclined to laugh,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      with so sorrowful an air, that Rose-Pompon, reproaching herself with her
      pleasantry, said to him: &ldquo;But how comes it that you know Cephyse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I do not know her&mdash;but a young fellow, that I like
      excessively&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques Rennepont?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise called Sleepinbuff. He is now in prison for debt,&rdquo;
      sighed Rodin. &ldquo;I saw him yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him yesterday?&mdash;how strange!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon,
      clapping her hands. &ldquo;Quick! quick!&mdash;come over to Philemon&rsquo;s,
      to give Cephyse news of her lover. She is so uneasy about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I should like to give her good news of that worthy
      fellow, whom I like in spite of his follies, for who has not been guilty
      of follies?&rdquo; added Rodin, with indulgent good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, twisting about as if she still
      wore the costume of a debardeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say more,&rdquo; added Rodin: &ldquo;I love him because of
      his follies; for, talk as we may, my dear child, there is always something
      good at bottom, a good heart, or something, in those who spend generously
      their money for other people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come! you are a very good sort of a man,&rdquo; said
      Rose-Pompon, enchanted with Rodin&rsquo;s philosophy. &ldquo;But why will
      you not come and see Cephyse, and talk to her of Jacques?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what use would it be to tell her what she knows already&mdash;that
      Jacques is in prison? What I should like, would be to get the worthy
      fellow out of his scrape.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! only do that, only get Jacques out of prison,&rdquo; cried
      Rose Pompon, warmly, &ldquo;and we will both give you a kiss&mdash;me and
      Cephyse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be throwing kisses away, dear little madcap!&rdquo; said
      Rodin, smiling. &ldquo;But be satisfied, I want no reward to induce me to
      do good when I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you hope to get Jacques out of prison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin shook his head, and answered with a grieved and disappointed air.
      &ldquo;I did hope it. Certainly, I did hope it; but now all is changed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Rose-Pompon, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That foolish joke of calling me M. Rodin may appear very amusing to
      you, my dear child. I understand it, you being only an echo. Some one has
      said to you: &lsquo;Go and tell M. Charlemagne that he is one M. Rodin.
      That will be very funny.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I should never myself have thought of calling you M.
      Rodin. One does not invent such names,&rdquo; answered Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! that person with his foolish jokes, has done, without knowing
      it, a great injury to Jacques Rennepont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! because I called you Rodin instead of Charlemagne?&rdquo;
      cried Rose Pompon, much regretting the pleasantry which she had carried on
      at the instigation of Ninny Moulin. &ldquo;But really, sir,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;what can this joke have to do with the service that you
      were, about to render Jacques?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at liberty to tell you, my child. In truth, I am very
      sorry for poor Jacques. Believe me, I am; but do let me pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, sir, I beg,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon; &ldquo;if I told
      you the name of the person who told me to call you Rodin, would you
      interest yourself again for Jacques?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to know any one&rsquo;s secrets, my dear child. In
      all this, you have been the echo of persons who are, perhaps, very
      dangerous; and, notwithstanding the interest I feel for Jacques Rennepont,
      I do not wish, you understand, to make myself enemies. Heaven forbid!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose-Pompon did not at all comprehend Rodin&rsquo;s fears, and upon this
      he had counted; for after a second&rsquo;s reflection, the young girl
      resumed: &ldquo;Well, sir&mdash;this is too deep for me; I do not
      understand it. All I know is, that I am truly sorry if I have injured a
      good young man by a mere joke. I will tell you exactly how it happened. My
      frankness may be of some use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankness will often clear up the most obscure matters,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Ninny&rsquo;s
      fault. Why does he tell me nonsense, that might injure poor Cephyse&rsquo;s
      lover? You see, sir, it happened in this way. Ninny Moulin who is fond of
      a joke, saw you just now in the street. The portress told him that your
      name was Charlemagne. He said to me: &lsquo;No; his name is Rodin. We must
      play him a trick. Go to his room, Rose-Pompon, knock at the door, and call
      him M. Rodin. You will see what a rum face he will make.&rsquo; I promised
      Ninny Moulin not to name him; but I do it, rather than run the risk of
      injuring Jacques.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ninny Moulin&rsquo;s name Rodin had not been able to repress a movement
      of surprise. This pamphleteer, whom he had employed to edit the &ldquo;Neighborly
      Love,&rdquo; was not personally formidable; but, being fond of talking in
      his drink, he might become troublesome, particularly if Rodin, as was
      probable, had often to visit this house, to execute his project upon
      Sleepinbuff, through the medium of the Bacchanal Queen. The socius
      resolved, therefore, to provide against this inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, my dear child,&rdquo; said he to Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;it is a M.
      Desmoulins that persuaded you to play off this silly joke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Desmoulins, but Dumoulin,&rdquo; corrected Rose. &ldquo;He
      writes in the pewholders&rsquo; papers, and defends the saints for money;
      for, if Ninny Moulin is a saint, his patrons are Saint Drinkard and Saint
      Flashette, as he himself declares.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman appears to be very gay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a very good fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stop,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, appearing to recollect himself;
      &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t he a man about thirty-six or forty, fat, with a ruddy
      complexion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20303.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruddy as a glass of red wine,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, &ldquo;and
      with a pimpled nose like a mulberry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man&mdash;M. Dumoulin. Oh! in that case, I am
      quite satisfied, my dear child. The jest no longer makes me uneasy; for M.
      Dumoulin is a very worthy man&mdash;only perhaps a little too fond of his
      joke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, you will try to be useful to Jacques? The stupid
      pleasantry of Ninny Moulin will not prevent you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must not tell Ninny Moulin that you know it was he who sent
      me to call you M. Rodin&mdash;eh, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? In every case, my dear child, it is always better to speak
      frankly the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, Ninny Moulin so strongly recommended me not to name him
      to you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have named him, it is from a very good motive; why not avow
      it? However, my dear child, this concerns you, not me. Do as you think
      best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I tell Cephyse of your good intentions towards Jacques?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth, my dear child, always the truth. One need never hesitate
      to say what is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Cephyse! how happy she will be!&rdquo; cried Rose-Pompon,
      cheerfully; &ldquo;and the news will come just in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only you must not exaggerate; I do not promise positively to get
      this good fellow out of prison; I say, that I will do what I can. But what
      I promise positively is&mdash;for, since the imprisonment of poor Jacques,
      your friend must be very much straitened&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I promise positively is some little assistance which your
      friend will receive to-day, to enable her to live honestly; and if she
      behaves well&mdash;hereafter&mdash;why, hereafter, we shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! you do not know how welcome will be your assistance to
      poor Cephyse! One might fancy you were her actual good angel. Faith! you
      may call yourself Rodin, or Charlemagne; all I know is, that you are a
      nice, sweet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, do not exaggerate,&rdquo; said Rodin; &ldquo;say a good
      sort of old fellow; nothing more, my dear child. But see how things fall
      out, sometimes! Who could have told me, when I heard you knock at my door&mdash;which,
      I must say, vexed me a great deal&mdash;that it was a pretty little
      neighbor of mine, who under the pretext of playing off a joke, was to put
      me in the way of doing a good action? Go and comfort your friend; this
      evening she will receive some assistance; and let us have hope and
      confidence. Thanks be, there are still some good people in the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! you prove it yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! The happiness of the old is to see the young happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said by Rodin with so much apparent kindness, that Rose-Pompon
      felt the tears well up to her eyes, and answered with much emotion:
      &ldquo;Sir, Cephyse and me are only poor girls; there are many more
      virtuous in the world; but I venture to say, we have good hearts. Now, if
      ever you should be ill, only send for us; there are no Sisters of Charity
      that will take better care of you. It is all that we can offer you,
      without reckoning Philemon, who shall go through fire and water for you, I
      give you my word for it&mdash;and Cephyse, I am sure, will answer for
      Jacques also, that he will be yours in life and death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear child, that I was right in saying&mdash;a fitful
      head and a good heart. Adieu, till we meet again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Rodin, taking up the basket, which he had placed on the ground
      by the side of his umbrella, prepared to descend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, you must give me this basket; it will be in your way
      going down,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, taking the basket from the hands of
      Rodin, notwithstanding his resistance. Then she added: &ldquo;Lean upon my
      arm. The stairs are so dark. You might slip.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accept your offer, my dear child, for I am not very
      courageous.&rdquo; Leaning paternally on the right arm of Rose-Pompon, who
      held the basket in her left hand, Rodin descended the stairs, and crossed
      the court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up there, on the third story, do you see that big face close to the
      window-frame?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon suddenly to Rodin, stopping in the
      centre of the little court. &ldquo;That is my Ninny Moulin. Do you know
      him? Is he the same as yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as mine,&rdquo; said Rodin, raising his head, and waving
      his hand very affectionately to Jacques Dumoulin, who, stupefied thereat,
      retired abruptly from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor fellow! I am sure he is afraid of me since his foolish
      joke,&rdquo; said Rodin, smiling. &ldquo;He is very wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he accompanied these last words with a sinister nipping of the lips,
      not perceived by Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear child,&rdquo; said he, as they both entered the
      passage, &ldquo;I no longer need you assistance; return to your friend,
      and tell her the good news you have heard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, you are right. I burn with impatience to tell her what a
      good man you are.&rdquo; And Rose-Pompon sprung towards the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop! how about my basket that the little madcap carries off
      with her?&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh true! I beg your pardon, sir. Poor Cephyse! how pleased she will
      be. Adieu, sir!&rdquo; And Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s pretty figure disappeared
      in the darkness of the staircase, which she mounted with an alert and
      impatient step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin issued from the entry. &ldquo;Here is your basket, my good lady,&rdquo;
      said he, stopping at the threshold of Mother Arsene&rsquo;s shop. &ldquo;I
      give you my humble thanks for your kindness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For nothing, my dear sir, for nothing. It is all at your service.
      Well, was the radish good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Succulent, my dear madame, and excellent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am glad of it. Shall we soon see you again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. But could you tell me where is the nearest post-office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to the left, the third house, at the grocer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wager it&rsquo;s a love letter for your sweetheart,&rdquo; said
      Mother Arsene, enlivened probably by Rose Pompon&rsquo;s and Ninny Moulin&rsquo;s
      proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! the good lady!&rdquo; said Rodin, with a titter. Then,
      suddenly resuming his serious aspect, he made a low bow to the
      greengrocer, adding: &ldquo;Your most obedient humble servant!&rdquo; and
      walked out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now usher the reader into Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s asylum, in which Mdlle.
      de Cardoville was confined.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. THE ADVICE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>drienne de
      Cardoville had been still more strictly confined in Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s
      house, since the double nocturnal attempt of Agricola and Dagobert, in
      which the soldier, though severely wounded, had succeeded, thanks to the
      intrepid devotion of his son, seconded by the heroic Spoil sport, in
      gaining the little garden gate of the convent, and escaping by way of the
      boulevard, along with the young smith. Four o&rsquo;clock had just struck.
      Adrienne, since the previous day, had been removed to a chamber on the
      second story of the asylum. The grated window, with closed shutters, only
      admitted a faint light to this apartment. The young lady, since her
      interview with Mother Bunch, expected to be delivered any day by the
      intervention of her friends. But she felt painful uneasiness on the
      subject of Agricola and Dagobert, being absolutely ignorant of the issue
      of the struggle in which her intended liberators had been engaged with the
      people of the asylum and convent. She had in vain questioned her keepers
      on the subject; they had remained perfectly mute. These new incidents had
      augmented the bitter resentment of Adrienne against the Princess de Saint
      Dizier, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and their creatures. The slight paleness
      of Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s charming face, and her fine eyes a little
      drooping, betrayed her recent sufferings; seated before a little table,
      with her forehead resting upon one of her hands, half veiled by the long
      curls of her golden hair, she was turning over the leaves of a book.
      Suddenly, the door opened, and M. Baleinier entered. The doctor, a Jesuit,
      in lay attire, a docile and passive instrument of the will of his Order,
      was only half in the confidence of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier. He was ignorant of the object of the
      imprisonment of Mdlle. de Cardoville; he was ignorant also of the sudden
      change which had taken place in the relative position of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and Rodin, after the reading of the testament of Marius de Rennepont. The
      doctor had, only the day before, received orders from Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      (now acting under the directions of Rodin) to confine Mdlle. de Cardoville
      still more strictly, to act towards her with redoubled severity, and to
      endeavor to force her, it will be seen by what expedients, to renounce the
      judicial proceedings, which she promised herself to take hereafter against
      her persecutors. At sight of the doctor, Mdlle. de Cardoville could not
      hide the aversion and disdain with which this man inspired her. M.
      Baleinier, on the contrary, always smiling, always courteous, approached
      Adrienne with perfect ease and confidence, stopped a few steps from her,
      as if to study her features more attentively, and then added like a man
      who is satisfied with the observations he had made: &ldquo;Come! the
      unfortunate events of the night before last have had a less injurious
      influence than I feared. There is some improvement; the complexion is less
      flushed, the look calmer, the eyes still somewhat too bright, but no
      longer shining with such unnatural fire. You are getting on so well! Now
      the cure must be prolonged&mdash;for this unfortunate night affair threw
      you into a state of excitement, that was only the more dangerous from your
      not being conscious of it. Happily, with care, your recovery will not, I
      hope, be very much delayed.&rdquo; Accustomed though she was to the
      audacity of this tool of the Congregation, Mdlle. de Cardoville could not
      forbear saying to him, with a smile of bitter disdain: &ldquo;What
      impudence, sir, there is in your probity! What effrontery in your zeal to
      earn your hire! Never for a moment do you lay aside your mask; craft and
      falsehood are ever on your lips. Really, if this shameful comedy causes
      you as much fatigue as it does me disgust and contempt, they can never pay
      you enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the doctor, in a sorrowful tone; &ldquo;always
      this unfortunate delusion, that you are not in want of our care!&mdash;that
      I am playing a part, when I talk to you of the sad state in which you were
      when we were obliged to bring you hither by stratagem. Still, with the
      exception of this little sign of rebellious insanity, your condition has
      marvellously improved. You are on the high-road to a complete cure.
      By-and-by, your excellent heart will render me the justice that is due to
      me; and, one day, I shall be judged as I deserve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, believe it, sir; the day approaches, in which you will be judged
      as you deserve,&rdquo; said Adrienne, laying great stress upon the two
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always that other fixed idea,&rdquo; said the doctor with a sort of
      commiseration. &ldquo;Come, be reasonable. Do not think of this
      childishness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! renounce my intention to demand at the hands of justice
      reparation for myself, and disgrace for you and your accomplices? Never,
      sir&mdash;never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the doctor, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;once
      at liberty, thank heaven, you will have many other things to think of, my
      fair enemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget piously the evil that you do; but I, sir, have a better
      memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk seriously. Have you really the intention of applying to
      the courts?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Baleinier, in a grave tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and you know that what I intend, I firmly carry out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I can only conjure you not to follow out this idea,&rdquo;
      replied the doctor, in a still more solemn tone; &ldquo;I ask it as a
      favor, in the name of your own interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, that you are a little too ready to confound your
      interest with mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now come,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, with a feigned impatience, as
      if quite certain of convincing Mdlle. de Cardoville on the instant;
      &ldquo;would you have the melancholy courage to plunge into despair two
      persons full of goodness and generosity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two? The jest would be complete, if you were to reckon three:
      you, sir, and my aunt, and Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny; for these are no doubt
      the generous persons in whose name you implore my pity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame; I speak neither of myself, nor of your aunt, nor of
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom, then, sir?&rdquo; asked Mdlle. de Cardoville with
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of two poor fellows, who, no doubt sent by those whom you call your
      friends, got into the neighboring convent the other night, and thence into
      this garden. The guns which you heard go off were fired at them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I thought so. They refused to tell me if either of them was
      wounded,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with painful emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them received a wound, but not very serious, since he was
      able to fly and escape pursuit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, clasping her hands
      with fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite natural that you should rejoice at their escape, but by
      what strange contradiction do you now wish to put the officers of justice
      on their track? A singular manner, truly, of rewarding their devotion!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, sir?&rdquo; asked Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For if they should be arrested,&rdquo; resumed Dr. Baleinier,
      without answering her, &ldquo;as they have been guilty of housebreaking
      and attempted burglary, they would be sent to the galleys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! and for my sake!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it would be for you, and what is worse, by you, that they
      would be condemned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By me, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; that is, if you follow up your vengeance against your
      aunt and Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&mdash;I do not speak of myself, for I am
      quite safe; in a word, if you persist in laying your complaint before the
      magistrates, that you have been unjustly confined in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, sir. Explain yourself,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, with growing uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child that you are!&rdquo; cried the Jesuit of the short robe, with
      an air of conviction; &ldquo;do you think that if the law once takes
      cognizance of this affair, you can stop short its action where and when
      you please? When you leave this house, you lodge a complaint against me
      and against your family; well, what happens? The law interferes, inquires,
      calls witnesses, enters into the most minute investigations. Then, what
      follows? Why, that this nocturnal escalade, which the superior of the
      convent has some interest in hushing up, for fear of scandal&mdash;that
      this nocturnal attempt, I say, which I also would keep quiet, is
      necessarily divulged, and as it involves a serious crime, to which a heavy
      penalty is attached, the law will ferret into it, and find out these
      unfortunate men, and if, as is probable, they are detained in Paris by
      their duties or occupations, or even by a false security, arising from the
      honorable motives which they know to have actuated them, they will be
      arrested. And who will be the cause of this arrest? You, by your
      deposition against us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! that would be horrible; but it is impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very possible, on the contrary,&rdquo; returned M. Baleinier:
      &ldquo;so that, while I and the superior of the convent, who alone are
      really entitled to complain, only wish to keep quiet this unpleasant
      affair, it is you&mdash;you, for whom these unfortunate men have risked
      the galleys&mdash;that will deliver them up to justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Mdlle. de Cardoville was not completely duped by the lay Jesuit,
      she guessed that the merciful intentions which he expressed with regard to
      Dagobert and his son, would be absolutely subordinate to the course she
      might take in pressing or abandoning the legitimate vengeance which she
      meant to claim of authority. Indeed, Rodin, whose instructions the doctor
      was following without knowing it, was too cunning to have it said to
      Mdlle. de Cardoville: &ldquo;If you attempt any proceedings, we denounce
      Dagobert and his son;&rdquo; but he attained the same end, by inspiring
      Adrienne with fears on the subject of her two liberators, so as to prevent
      her taking any hostile measures. Without knowing the exact law on the
      subject, Mdlle. de Cardoville had too much good sense not to understand
      that Dagobert and Agricola might be very seriously involved in consequence
      of their nocturnal adventure, and might even find themselves in a terrible
      position. And yet, when she thought of all she had suffered in that house,
      and of all the just resentment she entertained in the bottom of her heart,
      Adrienne felt unwilling to renounce the stern pleasure of exposing such
      odious machinations to the light of day. Dr. Baleinier watched with sullen
      attention her whom he considered his dupe, for he thought he could divine
      the cause of the silence and hesitation of Mdlle. de Cardoville.

    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; resumed the latter, unable to conceal her anxiety,
      &ldquo;if I were disposed, for whatever reason, to make no complaint, and
      to forget the wrongs I have suffered, when should I leave this place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell; for I do not know when you will be radically cured,&rdquo;
      said the doctor, benignantly. &ldquo;You are in a very good way, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still this insolent and stupid acting!&rdquo; broke forth Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, interrupting the doctor with indignation. &ldquo;I ask, and if
      it must be, I entreat you to tell me how long I am to be shut up in this
      dreadful house, for I shall leave it some day, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, certainly,&rdquo; said the Jesuit of the short robe,
      with unction; &ldquo;but when, I am unable to say. Moreover, I must tell
      you frankly, that every precaution is taken against such attempts as those
      of the other night; and the most vigorous watch will be maintained, to
      prevent your communicating with any one. And all this in your own
      interest, that your poor head may not again be dangerously excited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, almost terrified, &ldquo;compared
      with what awaits me, the last few days have been days of liberty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your interest before everything,&rdquo; answered the doctor, in a
      fervent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, feeling the impotence of her indignation and
      despair, heaved a deep sigh, and hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, quick footsteps were heard in the passage, and one of the
      nurses entered, after having knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she to the doctor, with a frightened air, &ldquo;there
      are two gentlemen below, who wish to see you instantly, and the lady also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne raised her head hastily; her eyes were bathed in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the names of these persons?&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, much
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them said to me,&rdquo; answered the nurse: &ldquo;&lsquo;Go
      and inform Dr. Baleinier that I am a magistrate, and that I come on a duty
      regarding Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A magistrate!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jesuit of the short robe,
      growing purple in the face, and unable to hide his surprise and
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; cried Adrienne, rising with vivacity, her
      countenance beaming through her tears with hope and joy; &ldquo;my friends
      have been informed in time, and the hour of justice is arrived!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask these persons to walk up,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, after a
      moment&rsquo;s reflection. Then, with a still more agitated expression of
      countenance, he approached Adrienne with a harsh, and almost menacing air,
      which contrasted with the habitual placidity of his hypocritical smile,
      and said to her in a low voice: &ldquo;Take care, madame! do not rejoice
      too soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I no longer fear you,&rdquo; answered Mdlle. de Cardoville, with a
      bright, flashing eye. &ldquo;M. de Montbron is no doubt returned to Paris,
      and has been informed in time. He accompanies the magistrate, and comes to
      deliver me. I pity you, sir&mdash;both you and yours,&rdquo; added
      Adrienne, with an accent of bitter irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; cried M. Baleinier, no longer able to dissemble his
      growing alarm, &ldquo;I repeat to you, take care! Remember what I have
      told you. Your accusations would necessarily involve the discovery of what
      took place the other night. Beware! the fate of the soldier and his son is
      in your hands. Recollect they are in danger of the convict&rsquo;s chains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am not your dupe, sir. You are holding out a covert menace.
      Have at least the courage to say to me, that, if I complain to the
      magistrates, you will denounce the soldier and his son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, that, if you make any complaint, those two people are
      lost,&rdquo; answered the doctor, ambiguously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled by what was really dangerous in the doctor&rsquo;s threats,
      Adrienne asked: &ldquo;Sir, if this magistrate questions me, do you think
      I will tell him a falsehood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will answer what is true,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, hastily, in
      the hope of still attaining his end. &ldquo;You will answer that you were
      in so excited a state of mind a few days ago, that it was thought
      advisable, for your own sake, to bring you hither, without your knowing
      it. But you are now so much better, that you acknowledge the utility of
      the measures taken with regard to you. I will confirm these words for,
      after all, it is the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, with indignation, &ldquo;never
      will I be the accomplice of so infamous a falsehood; never will I be base
      enough to justify the indignities that I have suffered!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the magistrate,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, as he caught the
      sound of approaching footsteps. &ldquo;Beware!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and, to the indescribable amazement of the doctor, Rodin
      appeared on the threshold, accompanied by a man dressed in black, with a
      dignified and severe countenance. In the interest of his projects, and
      from motives of craft and prudence that will hereafter be known, Rodin had
      not informed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and consequently the doctor, of the
      unexpected visit he intended to pay to the asylum, accompanied by a
      magistrate. On the contrary, he had only the day before given orders to M.
      Baleinier to confine Mdlle. de Cardoville still more strictly. Therefore,
      imagine the stupor of the doctor when he saw the judicial officer, whose
      unexpected presence and imposing aspect were otherwise sufficiently
      alarming, enter the room, accompanied by Rodin, Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      humble and obscure secretary. From the door, Rodin, who was very shabbily
      dressed, as usual, pointed out Mdlle. de Cardoville to the magistrate, by
      a gesture at once respectful and compassionate. Then, while the latter,
      who had not been able to repress a movement of admiration at sight of the
      rare beauty of Adrienne, seemed to examine her with as much surprise as
      interest, the Jesuit modestly receded several steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Baleinier in his extreme astonishment, hoping to be understood by
      Rodin, made suddenly several private signals, as if to interrogate him on
      the cause of the magistrate&rsquo;s visit. But this was only productive of
      fresh amazement to M. Baleinier; for Rodin did not appear to recognize
      him, or to understand his expressive pantomime, and looked at him with
      affected bewilderment. At length, as the doctor, growing impatient,
      redoubled his mute questionings, Rodin advanced with a stride, stretched
      forward his crooked neck, and said, in a loud voice: &ldquo;What is your
      pleasure, doctor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, which completely disconcerted Baleinier, broke the silence
      which had reigned for some seconds, and the magistrate turned round. Rodin
      added, with imperturbable coolness: &ldquo;Since our arrival, the doctor
      has been making all sorts of mysterious signs to me. I suppose he has
      something private to communicate, but, as I have no secrets, I must beg
      him to speak out loud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This reply, so embarrassing for M. Baleinier, uttered in a tone of
      aggression, and with an air of icy coldness, plunged the doctor into such
      new and deep amazement, that he remained for some moments without
      answering. No doubt the magistrate was struck with this incident, and with
      the silence which followed it, for he cast a look of great severity on the
      doctor. Mdlle. de Cardoville, who had expected to have seen M. de
      Montbron, was also singularly surprised.

      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE ACCUSER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>aleinier,
      disconcerted for a moment by the unexpected presence of a magistrate, and
      by Rodin&rsquo;s inexplicable attitude, soon recovered his presence of
      mind, and addressing his colleague of the longer robe, said to him:
      &ldquo;If I make signs to you, sir, it was that, while I wished to respect
      the silence which this gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at the magistrate&mdash;&ldquo;has
      preserved since his entrance, I desired to express my surprise at the
      unexpected honor of this visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to the lady that I will explain the reason for my silence,
      and beg her to excuse it,&rdquo; replied the magistrate, as he made a
      half-bow to Adrienne, whom he thus continued to address: &ldquo;I have
      just received so serious a declaration with regard to you, madame, that I
      could not forbear looking at you for a moment in silence, to see if I
      could read in your countenance or in your attitude, the truth or falsehood
      of the accusation that has been placed in my hands; and I have every
      reason to believe that it is but too well founded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I at length be informed, sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, in a
      polite but firm tone, &ldquo;to whom I have the honor of speaking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am juge d&rsquo;instruction, and I have come to inform
      myself as to a fact which has been pointed out to me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the honor to explain yourself, sir?&rdquo; said the
      doctor, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; resumed the magistrate, M. de Gernande, a man of about
      fifty years of age, full of firmness and straightforwardness, and knowing
      how to unite the austere duties of his position with benevolent
      politeness, &ldquo;you are accused of having committed&mdash;a very great
      error, not to use a harsher expression. As for the nature of that error, I
      prefer believing, sir, that you (a first rate man of science) may have
      been deceived in the calculation of a medical case, rather than suspect
      you of having forgotten all that is sacred in the exercise of a profession
      that is almost a priesthood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you specify the facts, sir,&rdquo; answered the Jesuit of the
      short robe, with a degree of haughtiness, &ldquo;it will be easy for me to
      prove that my reputation as a man of science is no less free from
      reproach, than my conscience as a man of honor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said M. de Gernande, addressing Adrienne, &ldquo;is
      it true that you were conveyed to this house by stratagem?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried M. Baleinier, &ldquo;permit me to observe, that
      the manner in which you open this question is an insult to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is to the lady that I have the honor of addressing myself,&rdquo;
      replied M. de Gernande, sternly; &ldquo;and I am the sole judge of the
      propriety of my questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne was about to answer affirmatively to the magistrate, when an
      expressive took from Dr. Baleinier reminded her that she would perhaps
      expose Dagobert and his son to cruel dangers. It was no base and vulgar
      feeling of vengeance by which Adrienne was animated, but a legitimate
      indignation, inspired by odious hypocrisy. She would have thought it
      cowardly not to unmask the criminals; but wishing to avoid compromising
      others, she said to the magistrate, with an accent full of mildness and
      dignity: &ldquo;Permit me, sir, in my turn, rather to ask you a question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the answer I make be considered a formal accusation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come hither, madame, to ascertain the truth, and no
      consideration should induce you to dissemble it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, sir,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne; &ldquo;but suppose, having
      just causes of complaint, I lay them before you, in order to be allowed to
      leave this house, shall I afterwards be at liberty not to press the
      accusations I have made?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may abandon proceedings, madame, but the law will take up your
      case in the name of society, if its rights have been inured in your
      person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I then not be allowed to pardon? Should I not be sufficiently
      avenged by a contemptuous forgetfulness of the wrongs I have suffered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally, madame, you may forgive and forget; but I have the
      honor to repeat to you, that society cannot show the same indulgence, if
      it should turn out that you have been the victim of a criminal machination&mdash;and
      I have every reason to fear it is so. The manner in which you express
      yourself, the generosity of your sentiments, the calmness and dignity of
      your attitude, convince me that I have been well informed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, recovering his coolness,
      &ldquo;that you will at least communicate the declaration that has been
      made to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been declared to me, sir,&rdquo; said the magistrate, in a
      stern voice, &ldquo;that Mdlle. de Cardoville was brought here by
      stratagem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By stratagem?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. The lady was brought here by stratagem,&rdquo; answered
      the Jesuit of the short robe, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You confess it, then?&rdquo; said M. de Gernande.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do, sir. I admit that I had recourse to means which we
      are unfortunately too often obliged to employ, when persons who most need
      our assistance are unconscious of their own sad state.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; replied the magistrate, &ldquo;it has also been
      declared to me, that Mdlle. de Cardoville never required such aid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, sir, is a question of medical jurisprudence, which has to be
      examined and discussed,&rdquo; said M. Baleinier, recovering his
      assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will, indeed, sir, be seriously discussed; for you are accused
      of confining Mdlle. De Cardoville, while in the full possession of all her
      faculties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I ask you for what purpose?&rdquo; said M. de Baleinier,
      with a slight shrug of the shoulders, and in a tone of irony. &ldquo;What
      interest had I to commit such a crime, even admitting that my reputation
      did not place me above so odious and absurd a charge?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are said to have acted, sir, in furtherance of a family plot,
      devised against Mdlle. de Cardoville for a pecuniary motive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who has dared, sir, to make so calumnious a charge?&rdquo;
      cried Dr. Baleinier, with indignant warmth. &ldquo;Who has had the
      audacity to accuse a respectable, and I dare to say, respected man, of
      having been the accomplice in such infamy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Rodin, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Dr. Baleinier, falling back two steps, as if
      thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I accuse you,&rdquo; repeated Rodin, in a clear sharp voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was this gentleman who came to me this morning, with ample
      proofs, to demand my interference in favor of Mdlle. de Cardoville,&rdquo;
      said the magistrate, drawing back a little, to give Adrienne the
      opportunity of seeing her defender.

    <p>
      Throughout this scene, Rodin&rsquo;s name had not hitherto been mentioned.
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had often heard speak of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      secretary in no very favorable terms; but, never having seen him, she did
      not know that her liberator was this very Jesuit. She therefore looked
      towards him, with a glance in which were mingled curiosity, interest,
      surprise and gratitude. Rodin&rsquo;s cadaverous countenance, his
      repulsive ugliness, his sordid dress, would a few days before have
      occasioned Adrienne a perhaps invincible feeling of disgust. But the young
      lady, remembering how the sempstress, poor, feeble, deformed, and dressed
      almost in rags was endowed notwithstanding her wretched exterior, with one
      of the noblest and most admirable hearts, recalled this recollection in
      favor of the Jesuit. She forgot that he was ugly and sordid, only to
      remember that he was old, that he seemed poor, and that he had come to her
      assistance. Dr. Baleinier, notwithstanding his craft, notwithstanding his
      audacious hypocrisy, in spite even of his presence of mind, could not
      conceal how much he was disturbed by Rodin&rsquo;s denunciation. His head
      became troubled as he remembered how, on the first day of Adrienne&rsquo;s
      confinement in this house, the implacable appeal of Rodin, through the
      hole in the door, had prevented him (Baleinier) from yielding to emotions
      of pity, inspired by the despair of this unfortunate young girl, driven
      almost to doubt of her own reason. And yet it was this very Rodin, so
      cruel, so inexorable, the devoted agent of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who
      denounced him (Baleinier), and brought a magistrate to set Adrienne at
      liberty&mdash;when, only the day before, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had
      ordered an increase of severity towards her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lay Jesuit felt persuaded that Rodin was betraying Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      in the most shameful manner, and that Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s friends
      had bribed and bought over this scoundrelly secretary. Exasperated by what
      he considered a monstrous piece of treachery, the doctor exclaimed, in a
      voice broken with rage: &ldquo;And it is you, sir, that have the impudence
      to accuse me&mdash;you, who only a few days ago&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, reflecting that the retort upon Rodin would be self-accusation, he
      appeared to give way to an excess of emotion, and resumed with bitterness:
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, you are the last person that I should have thought capable
      of this odious denunciation. It is shameful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who had a better right than I to denounce this infamy?&rdquo;
      answered Rodin, in a rude, overbearing tone. &ldquo;Was I not in a
      position to learn&mdash;unfortunately, too late&mdash;the nature of the
      conspiracy of which Mdlle. de Cardoville and others have been the victims?
      Then, what was my duty as an honest man? Why, to inform the magistrate, to
      prove what I set forth, and to accompany him hither. That is what I have
      done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor, addressing the magistrate, &ldquo;it
      is not only myself that this man accuses, but he dares also&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accuse the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, in a
      still louder and more imperative tone, interrupting the doctor, &ldquo;I
      accuse the Princess de Saint-Dizier, I accuse you, sir&mdash;of having,
      from a vile motive of self interest, confined Mdlle. de Cardoville in this
      house, and the two daughters of Marshal Simon in the neighboring convent.
      Is that clear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is only too true,&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily. &ldquo;I
      have seen those poor children all in tears, making signs of distress to
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      The accusation of Rodin, with regard to the orphans, was a new and fearful
      blow for Dr. Baleinier. He felt perfectly convinced that the traitor had
      passed clear over to the enemy&rsquo;s camp. Wishing therefore to put an
      end to this embarrassing scene, he tried to put a good face on the matter,
      in spite of his emotion, and said to the magistrate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might confine myself, sir, to silence&mdash;disdaining to answer
      such accusations, till a judicial decision had given them some kind of
      authority. But, strong in a good conscience I address myself to Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, and I beg her to say if this very morning I did not inform
      her, that her health would soon be sufficiently restored to allow her to
      leave this house. I conjure her, in the name of her well-known love of
      truth to state if such was not my language, when I was alone with her&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir!&rdquo; said Rodin, interrupting Baleinier with an
      insolent air; &ldquo;suppose that, from pure generosity, this dear young
      lady were to admit as much&mdash;what will it prove in your favor?&mdash;why,
      nothing at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir,&rdquo; cried the doctor, &ldquo;do you presume&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume to unmask you, without asking your leave. What have you
      just told us? Why, that being alone with Mdlle. de Cardoville, you talked
      to her as if she were really mad. How very conclusive!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo; cried the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, without allowing him to continue,
      &ldquo;it is evident that, foreseeing the possibility of what has occurred
      to-day, and, to provide yourself with a hole to creep out at, you have
      pretended to believe your own execrable falsehood, in presence of this
      poor young lady, that you might afterwards call in aid the evidence of
      your own assumed conviction. Come, sir! such stories will not go down with
      people of common sense or common humanity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Baleinier, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, in a still louder voice, which
      completely drowned that of the doctor; &ldquo;is it true, or is it not,
      that you have recourse to the mean evasion of ascribing this odious
      imprisonment to a scientific error? I affirm that you do so, and that you
      think yourself safe, because you can now say: &lsquo;Thanks to my care,
      the young lady has recovered her reason. What more would you have?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do say that, sir, and I maintain it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You maintain a falsehood; for it is proven that the lady never lost
      her reason for a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I, sir, maintain that she did lose it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, sir, will prove the contrary,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? How will you do that?&rdquo; cried the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall take care not to tell you at present, as you may well
      suppose,&rdquo; answered Rodin, with an ironical smile, adding with
      indignation: &ldquo;But, really, sir, you ought to die for shame, to dare
      to raise such a question in presence of the lady. You should at least have
      spared her this discussion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fie, sir! I say, fie! It is odious to maintain this argument
      before her&mdash;odious if you speak truth, doubly odious if you lie,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This violence is inconceivable!&rdquo; cried the Jesuit of the
      short robe, exasperated; &ldquo;and I think the magistrate shows great
      partiality in allowing such gross calumnies to be heaped upon me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered M. de Gernande, severely, &ldquo;I am entitled
      not only to hear, but to provoke any contradictory discussion that may
      enlighten me in the execution of my duty; it results from all this, that,
      even in your opinion, sir, Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s health is
      sufficiently good to allow her to return home immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I do not see any very serious inconvenience likely to
      arise from it, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor: &ldquo;only I maintain that
      the cure is not so complete as it might have been, and, on this subject, I
      decline all responsibility for the future.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do so, safely,&rdquo; said Rodin; &ldquo;it is not likely
      that the young lady will ever again have recourse to your honest
      assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless, therefore, to employ my official authority, to
      demand the immediate liberation of Mdlle. de Cardoville,&rdquo; said the
      magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is free,&rdquo; said Baleinier, &ldquo;perfectly free.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the question whether you have imprisoned her on the plea of
      a suppositious madness, the law will inquire into it, sir, and you will be
      heard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite easy, sir,&rdquo; answered M. Baleinier, trying to look
      so; &ldquo;my conscience reproaches me with nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it may turn out well, sir,&rdquo; said M. de Gernande.
      &ldquo;However bad appearances may be, more especially when persons of
      your station in society are concerned, we should always wish to be
      convinced of their innocence.&rdquo; Then, turning to Adrienne, he added:
      &ldquo;I understand, madame, how painful this scene must be to all your
      feelings of delicacy and generosity; hereafter, it will depend upon
      yourself, either to proceed for damages against M. Baleinier, or to let
      the law take its course. One word more. The bold and upright man&rdquo;&mdash;here
      the magistrate pointed to Rodin&mdash;&ldquo;who has taken up your cause
      in so frank and disinterested a manner, expressed a belief that you would,
      perhaps, take charge for the present of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters,
      whose liberation I am about to demand from the convent where they also are
      confined by stratagem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, sir,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, &ldquo;that, as soon as
      I learned the arrival of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters in Paris, my
      intention was to offer them apartments in my house. These young ladies are
      my near relations. It is at once a duty and a pleasure for me to treat
      them as sisters. I shall, therefore, be doubly grateful to you, sir, if
      you will trust them to my care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that I cannot serve them better,&rdquo; answered M. de
      Gernande. Then, addressing Baleinier, he added, &ldquo;Will you consent,
      sir, to my bringing these two ladies hither? I will go and fetch them,
      while Mdlle. de Cardoville prepares for her departure. They will then be
      able to leave this house with their relation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat the lady to make use of this house as her own, until she
      leaves it,&rdquo; replied M. Baleinier. &ldquo;My carriage shall be at her
      orders to take her home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the magistrate, approaching Adrienne, &ldquo;without
      prejudging the question, which must soon be decided by, a court of law, I
      may at least regret that I was not called in sooner. Your situation must
      have been a very cruel one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will at least remain to me, sir, from this mournful time,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne, with graceful dignity, &ldquo;one precious and touching
      remembrance&mdash;that of the interest which you have shown me. I hope
      that you will one day permit me to thank you, at my own home, not for the
      justice you have done me, but for the benevolent and paternal manner in
      which you have done it. And moreover, sir,&rdquo; added Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, with a sweet smile, &ldquo;I should like to prove to you, that
      what they call my cure is complete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Gernande bowed respectfully in reply. During the abort dialogue of
      the magistrate with Adrienne, their backs were both turned to Baleinier
      and Rodin. The latter, profiting by this moment&rsquo;s opportunity,
      hastily slipped into the doctor&rsquo;s hand a note just written with a
      pencil in the bottom of his hat. Baleinier looked at Rodin in stupefied
      amazement. But the latter made a peculiar sign, by raising his thumb to
      his forehead, and drawing it twice across his brow. Then he remained
      impassible. This had passed so rapidly, that when M. de Gernande turned
      round, Rodin was at a distance of several steps from Dr. Baleinier, and
      looking at Mdlle. de Cardoville with respectful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to accompany you, sir,&rdquo; said the doctor, preceding
      the magistrate, whom Mdlle. de Cardoville saluted with much affability.
      Then both went out, and Rodin remained alone with the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      After conducting M. de Gernande to the outer door of the house, M.
      Baleinier made haste to read the pencil-note written by Rodin; it ran as
      follows: &ldquo;The magistrate is going to the convent, by way of the
      street. Run round by the garden, and tell the Superior to obey the order I
      have given with regard to the two young girls. It is of the utmost
      importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar sign which Rodin had made, and the tenor of this note, proved
      to Dr. Baleinier, who was passing from surprise to amazement, that the
      secretary, far from betraying the reverend father, was still acting for
      the Greater Glory of the Lord. However, whilst he obeyed the orders, M.
      Baleinier sought in vain to penetrate the motives of Rodin&rsquo;s
      inexplicable conduct, who had himself informed the authorities of an
      affair that was to have been hushed up, and that might have the most
      disastrous consequences for Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, Madame de
      Saint-Dizier, and Baleinier himself. But let us return to Rodin, left
      alone with Mdlle, de Cardoville.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. FATHER D&rsquo;AIGRIGNY&rsquo;S SECRETARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ardly had the
      magistrate and Dr. Baleinier disappeared, than Mdlle. de Cardoville, whose
      countenance was beaming with joy, exclaimed, as she looked at Rodin with a
      mixture of respect and gratitude, &ldquo;At length, thanks to you, sir, I
      am free&mdash;free! Oh, I had never before felt how much happiness,
      expansion, delight, there is in that adorable word&mdash;liberty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom rose and fell, her rosy nostrils dilated, her vermilion lips
      were half open, as if she again inhaled with rapture pure and vivifying
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been only a few days in this horrible place,&rdquo; she
      resumed, &ldquo;but I have suffered enough from my captivity to make me
      resolve never to let a year pass without restoring to liberty some poor
      prisoners for debt. This vow no doubt appears to belong a little to the
      Middle Ages,&rdquo; added she, with a smile; &ldquo;but I would fain
      borrow from that noble epoch something more than its old windows and
      furniture. So, doubly thanks, sir!&mdash;for I take you as a partner in
      that project of deliverance, which has just (you see) unfolded itself in
      the midst of the happiness I owe to you, and by which you seem so much
      affected. Oh! let my joy speak my gratitude, and pay you for your generous
      aid!&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had truly remarked a complete transfiguration in the
      countenance of Rodin. This man, lately so harsh, severe, inflexible, with
      regard to Dr. Baleinier, appeared now under the influence of the mildest
      and most tender sentiments. His little, half-veiled eyes were fixed upon
      Adrienne with an expression of ineffable interest. Then, as if he wished
      to tear himself from these impressions, he said, speaking to himself,
      &ldquo;Come, come, no weakness. Time is too precious; my mission is not
      fulfilled. My dear young lady,&rdquo; added he, addressing himself to
      Adrienne, &ldquo;believe what I say&mdash;we will talk hereafter of
      gratitude&mdash;but we have now to talk of the present so important for
      you and your family. Do you know what is taking place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne looked at the Jesuit with surprise, and said, &ldquo;What is
      taking place, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the real motive of your imprisonment in this house? Do
      you know what influenced the Princess de Saint-Dizier and Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of those detested names, Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s face,
      now so full of happiness, became suddenly sad, and she answered with
      bitterness, &ldquo;It is hatred, sir, that no doubt animated Madame de
      Saint-Dizier against me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, hatred; and, moreover, the desire to rob you with impunity of
      an immense fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, sir! how?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be ignorant, my dear young lady, of the interest you had
      to be in the Rue Saint-Francois on the 13th February, for an inheritance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was ignorant, sir, of the date and details: but I knew by some
      family papers, and thanks to an extraordinary circumstance, that one of
      our ancestors&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had left an enormous sum to be divided between his descendants; is
      it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what unfortunately you did not know, my dear young lady, was
      that the heirs were all bound to be present at a certain hour on the 13th
      February. This day and hour once past, the absent would forfeit their
      claim. Do you now understand why you have been imprisoned here, my dear
      young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I understand it,&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville;
      &ldquo;cupidity was added to the hatred which my aunt felt for me. All is
      explained. Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters, having the same right as I had
      have, like me, been imprisoned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; cried Rodin, &ldquo;you and they were not the only
      victims.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, then, are the others, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young East Indian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Djalma?&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the same reason he has been nearly poisoned with a narcotic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; cried the young girl, clasping her hands in
      horror. &ldquo;It is fearful. That young prince, who was said to have so
      noble and generous a character! But I had sent to Cardoville Castle&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A confidential person, to fetch the prince to Paris&mdash;I know
      it, my dear young lady; but, by means of a trick, your friend was got out
      of the way, and the young Oriental delivered to his enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only vague information on the subject. I know that he is in
      Paris, and do not despair of finding him. I shall pursue my researches
      with an almost paternal ardor, for we cannot too much love the rare
      qualities of that poor king&rsquo;s son. What a heart, my dear young lady!
      what a heart! Oh, it is a heart of gold, pure and bright as the gold of
      his country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must find the prince, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne with emotion;
      &ldquo;let me entreat you to neglect nothing for that end. He is my
      relation&mdash;alone here&mdash;without support&mdash;without assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Rodin, with commiseration. &ldquo;Poor
      boy!&mdash;for he is almost a boy&mdash;eighteen or nineteen years of age&mdash;thrown
      into the heart of Paris, of this hell&mdash;with his fresh, ardent,
      half-savage passions&mdash;with his simplicity and confidence&mdash;to
      what perils may he not be exposed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must first find him, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily;
      &ldquo;and then we will save him from these dangers. Before I was confined
      here, I learned his arrival in France, and sent a confidential person to
      offer him the services of an unknown friend. I now see that this mad idea,
      with which I have been so much reproached, was a very sensible one. I am
      more convinced of it than ever. The prince belongs to my family, and I owe
      him a generous hospitality. I had destined for him the lodge I occupied at
      my aunt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my dear young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, I shall remove to a house, which I had prepared some time
      ago, with the determination of quitting Madame de Saint-Dizier, and living
      alone as I pleased. Then, sir, as you seem bent upon being the good genius
      of our family, be as generous with regard to Prince Djalma, as you have
      been to me and Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters. I entreat you to discover
      the hiding-place of this poor king&rsquo;s son, as you call him; keep my
      secret for me, and conduct him to the house offered by the unknown friend.
      Let him not disquiet himself about anything; all his wants shall be
      provided for; he shall live&mdash;like a prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he will indeed live like a prince, thanks to your royal
      munificence. But never was such kind interest better deserved. It is
      enough to see (as I have seen) his fine, melancholy countenance&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen him, then, sir?&rdquo; said Adrienne, interrupting
      Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear young lady; I was with him for about two hours. It was
      quite enough to judge of him. His charming features are the mirror of his
      soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did you see him, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;At your old Chateau de Cardoville, my dear young lady, near which
      he had been shipwrecked in a storm, and whither I had gone to&mdash;&rdquo;
      Rodin hesitated for a moment, and then, as if yielding to the frankness of
      his disposition, added: &ldquo;Whither I had gone to commit a bad action&mdash;a
      shameful, miserable action, I must confess!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir?&mdash;at Cardoville House&mdash;to commit a bad action?&rdquo;
      cried Adrienne, much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes, my dear young lady,&rdquo; answered Rodin with
      simplicity. &ldquo;In one word, I had orders from Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      to place your former bailiff in the alternative either of losing his
      situation or lending himself to a mean action&mdash;something, in fact,
      that resembled spying and calumny; but the honest, worthy man refused.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who are you, sir?&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, more and
      more astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Rodin, lately secretary of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&mdash;a
      person of very little importance, as you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the accent, at once humble and ingenuous, of
      the Jesuit, as he pronounced these words, which he accompanied with a
      respectful bow. On this revelation, Mdlle. de Cardoville drew back
      abruptly. We have said that Adrienne had sometimes heard talk of Rodin,
      the humble secretary of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, as a sort of obedient
      and passive machine. That was not all; the bailiff of Cardoville Manor,
      writing to Adrienne on the subject of Prince Djalma, had complained of the
      perfidious and dishonest propositions of Rodin. She felt, therefore, a
      vague suspicion, when she heard that her liberator was the man who had
      played so odious a part. Yet this unfavorable feeling was balanced by the
      sense of what she owed to Rodin, and by his frank denunciation of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      before the magistrate. And then the Jesuit, by his own confession, had
      anticipated, as it were, the reproaches that might have been addressed to
      him. Still, it was with a kind of cold reserve that Mdlle. de Cardoville
      resumed this dialogue, which she had commenced with as much frankness as
      warmth and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin perceived the impression he had made. He expected it. He was not the
      least disconcerted when Mdlle. de Cardoville said to him, as she fixed
      upon him a piercing glance, &ldquo;Ah! you are M. Rodin&mdash;secretary to
      the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say ex-secretary, if you please, my dear young lady,&rdquo;
      answered the Jesuit; &ldquo;for you see clearly that I can never again
      enter the house of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. I have made of him an
      implacable enemy, and I am now without employment&mdash;but no matter&mdash;nay,
      so much the better&mdash;since, at this price, the wicked are unmasked,
      and honest people rescued.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, spoken with much simplicity, and dignity, revived a feeling
      of pity in Adrienne&rsquo;s heart. She thought within herself that, after
      all, the poor old man spoke the truth. Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s hate,
      after this exposure, would be inexorable, and Rodin had braved it for the
      sake of a generous action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mdlle. de Cardoville answered coldly, &ldquo;Since you knew, sir,
      that the propositions you were charged to make to the bailiff of
      Cardoville were shameful and perfidious, how could you undertake the
      mission?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; replied Rodin, with a sort of painful impatience;
      &ldquo;why, because I was completely under Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      charm, one of the most prodigiously clever men I have ever known, and, as
      I only discovered the day before yesterday, one of the most prodigiously
      dangerous men there is in the world. He had conquered my scruples, by
      persuading me that the End justifies the Means. I must confess that the
      end he seemed to propose to himself was great and beautiful; but the day
      before yesterday I was cruelly undeceived. I was awakened, as it were, by
      a thunder-peal. Oh, my dear young lady!&rdquo; added Rodin, with a sort of
      embarrassment and confusion, &ldquo;let us talk no more of my fatal
      journey to Cardoville. Though I was only an ignorant and blind instrument,
      I feel as ashamed and grieved at it as if I had acted for myself. It
      weighs upon me, it oppresses me. I entreat you, let us speak rather of
      yourself, and of what interests you&mdash;for the soul expands with
      generous thoughts, even as the breast is dilated in pure and healthful
      air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin had confessed his fault so spontaneously, he explained it so
      naturally, he appeared to regret it so sincerely, that Adrienne, whose
      suspicions had no other grounds, felt her distrust a good deal diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she resumed, still looking attentively at Rodin, &ldquo;it
      was at Cardoville that you saw Prince Djalma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; and my affection for him dates from that interview.
      Therefore I will accomplish my task. Be satisfied, my dear young lady;
      like you, like Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters, the prince shall avoid
      being the victim of this detestable plot, which unhappily does not stop
      there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who besides, then, is threatened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy, a man full of honor and probity, who is also your
      relation, and interested in this inheritance, but kept away from Paris by
      infamous treachery. And another heir, an unfortunate artisan, who falling
      into a trap cleverly baited, has been thrown into a prison for debt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, suddenly, &ldquo;for whose
      advantage was this abominable plot, which really alarms me, first devised?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the advantage of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,&rdquo; answered Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, and by what right! Was he also an heir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would take too long to explain it to you, my dear young lady.
      You will know all one day. Only be convinced that your family has no more
      bitter enemy that Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, giving way to one last suspicion,
      &ldquo;I will speak frankly to you. How can I have deserved the interest
      that you seem to take in me, and that you even extend to all the members
      of my family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; answered Rodin, with a smile, &ldquo;were
      I to tell you the cause, you would only laugh at, or misapprehend me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, I beg of you, sir. Do not mistrust me or yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I became interested in you&mdash;devoted to you&mdash;because
      your heart is generous, your mind lofty, your character independent and
      proud. Once attached to you, those of your race, who are indeed themselves
      worthy of interest, were no longer indifferent to me. To serve them was to
      serve you also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;admitting that you suppose me worthy of the too
      flattering praises you bestow upon me&mdash;how could you judge of my
      heart, my mind, my character?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, my dear young lady; but first I must make another
      confession, that fills me with shame. If you were not even so wonderfully
      endowed, what you have suffered in this house should suffice to command
      the interest of every honest man&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think it should, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might thus explain the interest I feel in you. But no&mdash;I
      confess it&mdash;that would not have sufficed with me. Had you been only
      Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;a rich, noble, beautiful young lady&mdash;I
      should doubtless have pitied your misfortune; but I should have said to
      myself, &lsquo;This poor young lady is certainly much to be pitied; but
      what can I, poor man, do in it? My only resource is my post of secretary
      to the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and he would be the first that must be
      attacked. He is all-powerful, and I am nothing. To engage in a struggle
      with him would be to ruin myself, without the hope of saving this
      unfortunate person.&rsquo; But when I learnt what you were, my dear young
      lady, I revolted, in spite of my inferiority. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;a thousand times, no! So fine an intellect, so great a heart, shall
      not be the victims of an abominable plot. I may perish in the struggle,
      but I will at least make the attempt.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No words can paint the mixture of delicacy, energy, and sensibility with
      which Rodin uttered these sentiments. As it often happens with people
      singularly repulsive and ill-favored, if they can once bring you to forget
      their ugliness, their very deformity becomes a source of interest and
      commiseration, and you say to yourself, &ldquo;What a pity that such a
      mind, such a soul, should inhabit so poor a body!&rdquo;&mdash;and you are
      touched and softened by the contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that Mdlle. de Cardoville began to look upon Rodin. He had
      shown himself as simple and affectionate towards her as he had been brutal
      and insolent to Dr. Baleinier. One thing only excited the lively curiosity
      of Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;she wished to know how Rodin had conceived
      the devotion and admiration which she seemed to inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my indiscreet and obstinate curiosity, sir, but I wish to
      know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you were morally revealed to me&mdash;is it not so? Oh, my dear
      young lady! nothing is more simple. I will explain it to you in two words.
      The Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny saw in me nothing but a writing-machine, an
      obtuse, mute, blind instrument&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny had more penetration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are right, my dear young lady; he is a man of unparalleled
      sagacity; but I deceived him by affecting more than simplicity. Do not,
      therefore, think me false. No; I am proud in my manner&mdash;and my pride
      consists in never appearing above my position, however subaltern it may
      be! Do you know why? It is that, however haughty may be my superiors, I
      can say to myself, &lsquo;They do not know my value. It is the inferiority
      of my condition, not me, that they humiliate.&rsquo; By this I gain doubly&mdash;my
      self-love is spared, and I hate no one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand that sort of pride,&rdquo; said Adrienne, more
      and more struck with Rodin&rsquo;s original turn of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let us return to what concerns you, my dear young lady. On the
      eve of the 13th of February, the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny delivered to me a
      paper in shorthand, and said to me, &lsquo;Transcribe this examination;
      you may add that it is to support the decision of a family council, which
      has declared, in accordance with the report of Dr. Baleinier, the state of
      mind of Mdlle. de Cardoville to be sufficiently alarming to render it
      necessary to confine her in a lunatic asylum.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with bitterness; &ldquo;it related to a
      long interview, which I had with the Princess de Saint-Dizier, my aunt,
      and which was taken down without my knowledge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold me, then, poring over my shorthand report, and beginning to
      transcribe it. At the end of the first ten lines, I was struck with
      stupor. I knew not if I were awake or dreaming. &lsquo;What! mad?&rsquo;
      They must be themselves insane who dare assert so monstrous a proposition!&mdash;More
      and more interested, I continued my reading&mdash;I finished it&mdash;Oh!
      then, what shall I say? What I felt, my dear young lady, it is impossible
      to express. It was sympathy, delight, enthusiasm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear young lady, enthusiasm! Let not the words shock your
      modesty. Know that these ideas, so new, so independent, so courageous
      which you expressed to your aunt with so much brilliancy, are, without
      your being aware of it, common to you and another person, for whom you
      will one day feel the most tender and religious respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom do you speak, sir?&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, more
      and more interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s apparent hesitation, Rodin resumed, &ldquo;No, no&mdash;it
      is useless now to inform you of it. All I can tell you, my dear young
      lady, is that, when I had finished my reading, I ran to Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s,
      to convince him of the error into which he had fallen with regard to you.
      It was impossible then to find him; but yesterday morning I told him
      plainly what I thought. He only appeared surprised to find that I could
      think at all. He received my communications with contemptuous silence. I
      thought him deceived; I continued my remonstrances, but quite in vain. He
      ordered me to follow him to the house, where the testament of your
      ancestor was to be opened. I was so blind with regard to the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      that it required the successive arrivals of the soldier, of his son, and
      of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s father, to open my eyes thoroughly. Their
      indignation unveiled to me the extent of a conspiracy, plotted long ago,
      and carried on with terrible ability. Then, I understood why you were
      confined here as a lunatic; why the daughters of Marshal Simon were
      imprisoned in a convent. Then a thousand recollections returned to my
      mind; fragments of letters and statements, which had been given me to copy
      or decipher, and of which I had never been able to find the explanation,
      put me on the track of this odious machination. To express then and there
      the sudden horror I felt at these crimes, would have been to ruin all. I
      did not make this mistake. I opposed cunning to cunning; I appeared even
      more eager than Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. Had this immense inheritance been
      destined for me alone, I could not have shown myself more grasping and
      merciless. Thanks to this stratagem, Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny had no
      suspicion. A providential accident having rescued the inheritance from his
      hands, he left the house in a state of profound consternation. For my
      part, I felt indescribable joy; for I had now the means of saving and
      avenging you, my dear young lady. As usual, I went yesterday evening to my
      place of business. During the absence of the abbe, it was easy for me to
      peruse the correspondence relative to the inheritance. In this way I was
      able to unite all the threads of this immense plot. Oh! then, my dear
      young lady, I remained, struck with horror, in presence of the discoveries
      that I made, and that I never should have made under any other
      circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What discoveries, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some secrets which are terrible to those who possess
      them. Do not ask me to explain, my dear young lady; but, in this
      examination, the league formed against you and your relations, from
      motives of insatiable cupidity, appeared to me in all its dark audacity.
      Thereupon, the lively and deep interest which I already felt for you, my
      dear young lady, was augmented greatly, and extended itself to the other
      innocent victims of this infernal conspiracy. In spite of my weakness, I
      determined to risk all, to unmask the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. I collected
      the necessary proofs, to give my declaration before the magistrate the
      needful authority; and, this morning, I left the abbe&rsquo;s house
      without revealing to him my projects. He might have employed some violent
      method to detain me; yet it would have been cowardly to attack him without
      warning. Once out of his house, I wrote to him, that I had in my hands
      proof enough of his crimes, to attack him openly in the face of day. I
      would accuse, and he must defend himself. I went directly to a magistrate,
      and you know the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, the door opened, and one of the nurses appeared, and
      said to Rodin: &ldquo;Sir, the messenger that you and the magistrate sent
      to the Rue Brise-Miche has just come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he left the letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and it was taken upstairs directly.&rdquo;
    </p>

      &ldquo;Very well. Leave us!&rdquo; The nurse went out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. SYMPATHY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f it had been
      possible for Mdlle. de Cardoville to harbor any suspicion of the sincerity
      of Rodin&rsquo;s devotion, it must have given way before this reasoning,
      unfortunately so simple and undeniable. How could she suppose the faintest
      complicity between the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny and his secretary, when it
      was the latter who completely unveiled the machinations of his master, and
      exposed them to the tribunals? when in this, Rodin went even further than
      Mdlle. de Cardoville would herself have gone? Of what secret design could
      she suspect the Jesuit? At worst, of a desire to earn by his services the
      profitable patronage of the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, had he not just now protested against this supposition, by
      declaring his devotion, not to Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;not to the fair,
      rich, noble lady&mdash;but to the high-souled and generous girl? Finally,
      as Rodin had said himself, could any but a miserable wretch fail to be
      interested in Adrienne&rsquo;s fate? A strange mixture of curiosity,
      surprise, and interest, was joined with Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s
      feelings of gratitude towards Rodin. Yet, as she recognized the superior
      mind under that humble exterior, she was suddenly struck with a grave
      suspicion. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she to Rodin, &ldquo;I always confess
      to the persons I esteem the doubts they may have inspired, so that they
      may justify themselves, and excuse me, if I am wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked at Mdlle. de Cardoville with surprise, as if mentally
      calculating the suspicions than she might entertain, and replied, after a
      moment&rsquo;s silence: &ldquo;You are perhaps thinking of my journey to
      Cardoville, of my base proposals to your good and worthy bailiff? Oh! if
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, interrupting him; &ldquo;you
      made that confession spontaneously, and I quite understand, that, blinded
      with regard to M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, you passively executed instructions
      repugnant to your delicacy. But how comes it, that, with your
      incontestable merits, you have so long; occupied so mean a position in his
      service?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Rodin, with a smile; &ldquo;that must
      impress you unfavorably, my dear young lady; for a man of any capacity,
      who remains long in an inferior condition, has evidently some radical
      vice, some bad or base passion&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is generally true, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And personally true&mdash;with regard to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir! do you make this avowal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I confess that I have a bad passion, to which, for forty
      years, I have sacrificed all chances of attaining to a better position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this passion, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I must make the unpleasant avowal, this passion is indolence&mdash;yes,
      indolence&mdash;the horror of all activity of mind, of all moral
      responsibility, of taking the lead in anything. With the twelve hundred
      francs that Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny gave me, I was the happiest man in the
      world; I trusted to the nobleness of his views; his thoughts became mine,
      his wishes mine. My work once finished, I returned to my poor little
      chamber, I lighted my fire, I dined on vegetables&mdash;then, taking up
      some book of philosophy, little known, and dreaming over it, I gave free
      course to my imagination, which, restrained all the day long, carried me
      through numberless theories to a delicious Utopia. Then, from the
      eminences of my intelligence, lifted up Lord knows whither, by the
      audacity of my thoughts, I seemed to look down upon my master, and upon
      the great men of the earth. This fever lasted for three or four hours,
      after which I had a good sleep; and, the next morning, I went lightly to
      my work, secure of my daily bread, without cares for the future, living
      content with little, waiting with impatience for the delights of my
      solitary evening, and saying to myself as I went on writing like a stupid
      machine: &lsquo;And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;if I chose!&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, you could, like others, surer than others, have reached
      a higher position,&rdquo; said Adrienne, greatly struck with Rodin&rsquo;s
      practical philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I could have done so; but for what purpose?&mdash;You
      see, my dear young lady, what often renders people of some merit puzzles
      to the vulgar, is that they are frequently content to say: &lsquo;If I
      chose!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, without attaching much importance to the luxuries of
      life, there is a certain degree of comfort, which age renders almost
      indispensable, and which you seem to have utterly renounced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undeceive yourself, if you please, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, with a playful smile. &ldquo;I am a true Sybarite; I require
      absolutely warm clothes, a good stove, a soft mattress, a good piece of
      bread, a fresh radish, flavored with good cheap salt, and some good, clear
      water; and, notwithstanding this complication of wants, my twelve hundred
      francs have always more than sufficed, for I have been able to make some
      little savings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now that you are without employment, how will you manage to
      live, sir?&rdquo; said Adrienne, more and more interested by the
      singularities of this man, and wishing to put his disinterestedness to the
      proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have laid by a little, which will serve me till I have unravelled
      the last thread of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s dark designs. I owe
      myself this reparation, for having been his dupe; three or four days, I
      hope, will complete the work. After that, I have the certainty of meeting
      with a situation, in my native province, under a collector of taxes: some
      time ago, the offer was made me by a friend; but then I would not leave
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, notwithstanding the advantages proposed. Fancy,
      my dear young lady&mdash;eight hundred francs, with board and lodging! As
      I am a little of the roughest, I should have preferred lodging apart; but,
      as they give me so much, I must submit to this little inconvenience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could exceed Rodin&rsquo;s ingenuity, in making these little
      household confidences (so abominably false) to Mdlle. de Cardoville, who
      felt her last suspicions give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir?&rdquo; said she to the Jesuit, with interest; &ldquo;in
      three or four days, you mean to quit Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to do so, my dear young lady; and that,&rdquo; added he, in
      a mysterious tone, &ldquo;and that for many reasons. But what would be
      very precious to me,&rdquo; he resumed, in a serious voice, as he looked
      at Adrienne with emotion, &ldquo;would be to carry with me the conviction,
      that you did me the justice to believe, that, on merely reading your
      interview with the Princess de Saint-Dizier, I recognized at once
      qualities quite unexampled in our day, in a young person of your age and
      condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a smile, &ldquo;do not think
      yourself obliged to return so soon the sincere praises that I bestowed on
      your superiority of mind. I should be better pleased with ingratitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I do not flatter you, my dear young lady. Why should I? We
      may probably never meet again. I do not flatter you; I understand you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all&mdash;and what will seem strange to you, is, that your appearance
      complete, the idea which I had already formed of you, my dear young lady,
      in reading your interview with your aunt: and some parts of your
      character, hitherto obscure to me, are now fully displayed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir, you astonish me more and more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it! I merely describe my impressions. I can now
      explain perfectly, for example, your passionate love of the beautiful,
      your eager worship of the refinements of the senses, your ardent
      aspirations for a better state of things, your courageous contempt of many
      degrading and servile customs, to which woman is condemned; yes, now I
      understand the noble pride with which you contemplate the mob of vain,
      self-sufficient, ridiculous men, who look upon woman as a creature
      destined for their service, according to the laws made after their own not
      very handsome image. In the eyes of these hedge-tyrants, woman, a kind of
      inferior being to whom a council of cardinals deigned to grant a soul by a
      majority of two voices, ought to think herself supremely happy in being
      the servant of these petty pachas, old at thirty, worn-out, used up, weary
      with excesses, wishing only for repose, and seeking, as they say, to make
      an end of it, which they set about by marrying some poor girl, who is on
      her side desirous to make a beginning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville would certainly have smiled at these satirical
      remarks, if she had not been greatly struck by hearing Rodin express in
      such appropriate terms her own ideas, though it was the first time in her
      life that she saw this dangerous man. Adrienne forgot, or rather, she was
      not aware, that she had to deal with a Jesuit of rare intelligence,
      uniting the information and the mysterious resources of the police-spy
      with the profound sagacity of the confessor; one of those diabolic
      priests, who, by the help of a few hints, avowals, letters, reconstruct a
      character, as Cuvier could reconstruct a body from zoological fragments.
      Far from interrupting Rodin, Adrienne listened to him with growing
      curiosity. Sure of the effect he produced, he continued, in a tone of
      indignation: &ldquo;And your aunt and the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny treated
      you as mad, because you revolted against the yoke of such tyrants!
      because, hating the shameful vices of slavery, you chose to be independent
      with the suitable qualities of independence, free with the proud virtues
      of liberty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, more and more surprised, &ldquo;how
      can my thoughts be so familiar to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I know you perfectly, thanks to your interview with the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier: and next, if it should happen that we both
      pursue the same end, though by different means,&rdquo; resumed Rodin,
      artfully, as he looked at Mdlle. de Cardoville with an air of
      intelligence, &ldquo;why should not our convictions be the same?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, sir. Of what end do you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end pursued incessantly by all lofty, generous, independent
      spirits&mdash;some acting, like you, my dear young lady, from passion,
      from instinct, without perhaps explaining to themselves the high mission
      they are called on to ful, fil. Thus, for example, when you take pleasure
      in the most refined delights, when you surround yourself with all that
      charms the senses, do you think that you only yield to the attractions of
      the beautiful, to the desire of exquisite enjoyments? No! ah, no! for then
      you would be incomplete, odiously selfish, a dry egotist, with a fine
      taste&mdash;nothing more&mdash;and at your age, it would be hideous, my
      dear young lady, it would be hideous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you really think thus severely of me?&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with uneasiness, so much influence had this man irresistibly attained over
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I should think thus of you, if you loved luxury for
      luxury&rsquo;s sake; but, no&mdash;quite another sentiment animates you,&rdquo;
      resumed the Jesuit. &ldquo;Let us reason a little. Feeling a passionate
      desire for all these enjoyments, you know their value and their need more
      than any one&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gratitude and favor are then necessarily acquired by those
      who, poor, laborious, and unknown, have procured for you these marvels of
      luxury, which you could not do without?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This feeling of gratitude is so strong in me, sir,&rdquo; replied
      Adrienne, more and more pleased to find herself so well understood,
      &ldquo;that I once had inscribed on a masterpiece of goldsmith&rsquo;s
      work, instead of the name of the seller, that of the poor unknown artist
      who designed it, and who has since risen to his true place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you see, I was not deceived,&rdquo; went on Rodin; &ldquo;the
      taste for enjoyment renders you grateful to those who procure it for you;
      and that is not all; here am I, an example, neither better nor worse than
      my neighbors, but accustomed to privations, which cause me no suffering&mdash;so
      that the privations of others necessarily touch me less nearly than they
      do you, my dear young lady; for your habits of comfort must needs render
      you more compassionate towards misfortune. You would yourself suffer too
      much from poverty, not to pity and succor those who are its victims.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, who began to feel herself under
      the fatal charm of Rodin, &ldquo;the more I listen to you, the more I am
      convinced that you would defend a thousand times better than I could those
      ideas for which I was so harshly reproached by Madame de Saint-Dizier and
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. Oh! speak, speak, sir! I cannot tell you with what
      happiness, with what pride I listen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Attentive and moved, her eyes fixed on the Jesuit with as much interest as
      sympathy and curiosity, Adrienne, by a graceful toss of the head that was
      habitual to her, threw hack her long, golden curls, the better to
      contemplate Rodin, who thus resumed: &ldquo;You are astonished, my dear
      young lady, that you were not understood by your aunt or by Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny!
      What point of contact had you with these hypocritical, jealous, crafty
      minds, such as I can judge them to be now? Do you wish a new proof of
      their hateful blindness? Among what they called your monstrous follies,
      which was the worst, the most damnable? Why, your resolution to live alone
      and in your own way, to dispose freely of the present and the future. They
      declared this to be odious, detestable, immoral. And yet&mdash;was this
      resolution dictated by a mad love of liberty? no!&mdash;by a disordered
      aversion to all restraint? no!&mdash;by the desire of singularity?&mdash;no!&mdash;for
      then I, too, should have blamed you severely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other reasons have indeed guided me, sir, I assure you,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne eagerly, for she had become very eager for the esteem with which
      her character might inspire Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know it well; your motives could only be excellent ones,&rdquo;
      replied the Jesuit. &ldquo;Why then did you take this resolution, so much
      called in question? Was it to brave established etiquette? no! for you
      respected them until the hate of Mme. de Saint-Dizier forced you to
      withdraw yourself from her unbearable guardianship. Was it to live alone,
      to escape the eyes of the world? no! you would be a hundred times more
      open to observation in this than any other condition. Was it to make a bad
      use of your liberty? no, ah, no! those who design evil seek for darkness
      and solitude; while you place yourself right before the jealous anal
      envious eyes of the vulgar crowd. Why then do you take this determination,
      so courageous and rare, unexampled in a young person of your age? Shall I
      tell you, my dear young lady? It is, that you wish to prove, by your
      example, that a woman of pure heart and honest mind, with a firm character
      and independence of soul, may nobly and proudly throw off the humiliating
      guardianship that custom has imposed upon her. Yes, instead of accepting
      the fate of a revolted slave, a life only destined to hypocrisy or vice,
      you wish to live freely in presence of all the world, independent,
      honorable, and respected. You wish to have, like man, the exercise of your
      own free will, the entire responsibility of all your actions, so as to
      establish the fact, that a woman left completely to herself, may equal man
      in reason, wisdom, uprightness, and surpass him indelicacy and dignity.
      That is your design, my dear young lady. It is noble and great. Will your
      example be imitated? I hope it may; but whether it be so or not, your
      generous attempt, believe me, will place you in a high and worthy
      position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s eyes shone with a proud and gentle
      brightness, her cheeks were slightly colored, her bosom heaved, she raised
      her charming head with a movement of involuntary pride; at length
      completely under the charm of that diabolical man she exclaimed: &ldquo;But,
      sir, who are you that can thus know and analyze my most secret thoughts,
      and read my soul more clearly than myself, so as to give new life and
      action to those ideas of independence which have long stirred within me?
      Who are you, that can thus elevate me in my own eyes, for now I am
      conscious of accomplishing a mission, honorable to myself, and perhaps
      useful to my sisters immersed in slavery? Once again, sir, who are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who am I, madame?&rdquo; answered Rodin, with a smile of the
      greatest good nature; &ldquo;I have already told you that I am a poor old
      man, who for the last forty years, having served in the day time as a
      writing machine to record the ideas of others, went home every evening to
      work out ideas of his own&mdash;a good kind of man who, from his garret,
      watches and even takes some little share in the movement of generous
      spirits, advancing towards an end that is nearer than is commonly thought.
      And thus, my dear young lady, as I told you just now, you and I are both
      tending towards the same objects, though you may do the same without
      reflection, and merely in obedience to your rare and divine instincts. So
      continue so to live, fair, free, and happy!&mdash;it is your mission&mdash;more
      providential than you may think it. Yes; continue to surround yourself
      with all the marvels of luxury and art; refine your senses, purify your
      tastes, by the exquisite choice of your enjoyments; by genius, grace, and
      purity raise yourself above the stupid and ill-favored mob of men, that
      will instantly surround you, when they behold you alone and free; they
      will consider you an easy prey, destined to please their cupidity, their
      egotism, their folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh at them, and mock these idiotic and sordid pretensions. Be
      the queen of your own world, and make yourself respected as a queen. Love&mdash;shine&mdash;enjoy&mdash;it
      is your part upon earth. All the flowers, with which you are whelmed in
      profusion, will one day bear fruit. You think that you have lived only for
      pleasure; in reality, you will have lived for the noblest aims that could
      tempt a great and lofty soul. And so&mdash;some years hence&mdash;we may
      meet again, perhaps; you, fairer and more followed than ever; I, older and
      more obscure. But, no matter&mdash;a secret voice, I am sure, says to you
      at this moment, that between us two, however different, there exists an
      invisible bond, a mysterious communion, which nothing hereafter will ever
      be able to destroy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered these final words in a tone of such profound emotion, that
      Adrienne started. Rodin had approached without her perceiving it, and
      without, as it were, walking at all, for he dragged his steps along the
      floor, with a sort of serpent motion; and he had spoken with so much
      warmth and enthusiasm, that his pale face had become slightly tinged, and
      his repulsive ugliness had almost disappeared before the brilliancy of his
      small sharp eyes, now wide open, and fixed full upon Adrienne. The latter
      leaned forward, with half-open lips and deep-drawn breath, nor could she
      take her eyes from the Jesuit&rsquo;s; he had ceased to speak, and yet she
      was still listening. The feelings of the fair young lady, in presence of
      this little old man, dirty, ugly, and poor, were inexplicable. That
      comparison so common, and yet so true, of the frightful fascination of the
      bird by the serpent, might give some idea of the singular impression made
      upon her. Rodin&rsquo;s tactics were skillful and sure. Until now, Mdlle.
      de Cardoville had never analyzed her tastes or instincts. She had followed
      them, because they were inoffensive and charming. How happy and proud she
      then was sure to be to hear a man of superior mind not only praise these
      tendencies, for which she had been heretofore so severely blamed, but
      congratulate her upon them, as upon something great, noble, and divine! If
      Rodin had only addressed himself to Adrienne&rsquo;s self-conceit, he
      would have failed in his perfidious designs, for she had not the least
      spark of vanity. But he addressed himself to all that was enthusiastic and
      generous in her heart; that which he appeared to encourage and admire in
      her was really worthy of encouragement and admiration. How could she fail
      to be the dupe of such language, concealing though it did such dark and
      fatal projects?
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck with the Jesuit&rsquo;s rare intelligence, feeling her curiosity
      greatly excited by some mysterious words that he had purposely uttered,
      hardly explaining to herself the strange influence which this pernicious
      counsellor already exercised over her, and animated by respectful
      compassion for a man of his age and talents placed in so precarious a
      position, Adrienne said to him, with all her natural cordiality, &ldquo;A
      man of your merit and character, sir, ought not to be at the mercy of the
      caprice of circumstances. Some of your words have opened a new horizon
      before me; I feel that, on many points, your counsels may be of the
      greatest use to me. Moreover, in coming to fetch me from this house, and
      in devoting yourself to the service of other persons of my family, you
      have shown me marks of interest which I cannot forget without ingratitude.
      You have lost a humble but secure situation. Permit me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word more, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      interrupting Mdlle. de Cardoville, with an air of chagrin. &ldquo;I feel
      for you the deepest sympathy; I am honored by having ideas in common with
      you; I believe firmly that some day you will have to ask advice of the
      poor old philosopher; and, precisely because of all that, I must and ought
      to maintain towards you the most complete independence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, it is I that would be the obliged party, if you deigned
      to accept what I offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said Rodin, with a smile: &ldquo;I
      know that your generosity would always know how to make gratitude light
      and easy; but, once more, I cannot accept anything from you. One day,
      perhaps, you will know why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible for me to tell you more. And then, supposing I
      were under an obligation to you, how could I tell you all that was good
      and beautiful in your actions? Hereafter, if you are somewhat indebted to
      me for my advice, so much the better; I shall be the more ready to blame
      you, if I find anything to blame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way, sir, you would forbid me to be grateful to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Rodin, with apparent emotion. &ldquo;Oh,
      believe me! there will come a solemn moment, in which you may repay all,
      in a manner worthy of yourself and me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation was here interrupted by the nurse, who said to Adrienne
      as she entered: &ldquo;Madame, there is a little humpback workwoman
      downstairs, who wishes to speak to you. As, according to the doctor&rsquo;s
      new orders, you are to do as you like, I have come to ask, if I am to
      bring her up to you. She is so badly dressed, that I did not venture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring her up, by all means,&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily, for she
      had recognized Mother Bunch by the nurse&rsquo;s description. &ldquo;Bring
      her up directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor has also left word, that his carriage is to be at your
      orders, madame; are the horses to be put to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a quarter of an hour,&rdquo; answered Adrienne to the
      nurse, who went out; then, addressing Rodin, she continued: &ldquo;I do
      not think the magistrate can now be long, before he returns with Marshal
      Simon&rsquo;s daughters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, my dear young lady; but who is this deformed
      workwoman?&rdquo; asked Rodin, with an air of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The adopted sister of a gallant fellow, who risked all in
      endeavoring to rescue me from this house. And, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with emotion, &ldquo;this young workwoman is a rare and excellent
      creature. Never was a nobler mind, a more generous heart, concealed
      beneath an exterior less&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But reflecting, that Rodin seemed to unite in his own person the same
      moral and physical contrasts as the sewing-girl, Adrienne stopped short,
      and then added, with inimitable grace, as she looked at the Jesuit, who
      was somewhat astonished at the sudden pause: &ldquo;No; this noble girl is
      not the only person who proves how loftiness of soul, and superiority of
      mind, can make us indifferent to the vain advantages which belong only to
      the accidents of birth or fortune.&rdquo; At the moment of Adrienne
      speaking these last words, Mother Bunch entered the room.

      CHAPTER XXXVI. SUSPICIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>dlle. de
      Cardoville sprang hastily to meet the visitor, and said to her, in a voice
      of emotion, as she extended her arms towards her: &ldquo;Come&mdash;come&mdash;there
      is no grating to separate us now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this allusion, which reminded her how her poor, laborious hand had been
      respectfully kissed by the fair and rich patrician, the young workwoman
      felt a sentiment of gratitude, which was at once ineffable and proud. But,
      as she hesitated to respond to the cordial reception, Adrienne embraced
      her with touching affection. When Mother Bunch found herself clasped in
      the fair arms of Mdlle. de Cardoville, when she felt the fresh and rosy
      lips of the young lady fraternally pressed to her own pale and sickly
      cheek, she burst into tears without being able to utter a word. Rodin,
      retired in a corner of the chamber, locked on this scene with secret
      uneasiness. Informed of the refusal, so full of dignity, which Mother
      Bunch had opposed to the perfidious temptations of the superior of St.
      Mary&rsquo;s Convent, and knowing the deep devotion of this generous
      creature for Agricola&mdash;a devotion which for some days she had so
      bravely extended to Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;the Jesuit did not like to
      see the latter thus laboring to increase that affection. He thought,
      wisely, that one should never despise friend or enemy, however small they
      may appear. Now, devotion to Mdlle. de Cardoville constituted an enemy in
      his eyes; and we know, moreover, that Rodin combined in his character rare
      firmness, with a certain degree of superstitious weakness, and he now felt
      uneasy at the singular impression of fear which Mother Bunch inspired in
      him. He determined to recollect this presentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delicate natures sometimes display in the smallest things the most
      charming instincts of grace and goodness. Thus, when the sewing-girl was
      shedding abundant and sweet tears of gratitude, Adrienne took a richly
      embroidered handkerchief, and dried the pale and melancholy face. This
      action, so simple and spontaneous, spared the work-girl one humiliation;
      for, alas! humiliation and suffering are the two gulfs, along the edge of
      which misfortune continually passes. Therefore, the least kindness is in
      general a double benefit to the unfortunate. Perhaps the reader may smile
      in disdain at the puerile circumstance we mention. But poor Mother Bunch,
      not venturing to take from her pocket her old ragged handkerchief, would
      long have remained blinded by her tears, if Mdlle. de Cardoville had not
      come to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are so good&mdash;so nobly charitable, lady!&rdquo; was all
      that the sempstress could say, in a tone of deep emotion; for she was
      still more touched by the attention of the young lady, than she would
      perhaps have been by a service rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne to Rodin, who drew near
      hastily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the young patrician, proudly, &ldquo;I
      have indeed discovered a treasure. Look at her, sir; and love her as I
      love her, honor as I honor. She has one of those hearts for which we are
      seeking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which, thank heaven, we are still able to find, my dear young
      lady!&rdquo; said Rodin, as he bowed to the needle-woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter raised her eyes slowly, and locked at the Jesuit. At sight of
      that cadaverous countenance, which was smiling benignantly upon her, the
      young girl started. It was strange! she had never seen this man, and yet
      she felt instantly the same fear and repulsion that he had felt with
      regard to her. Generally timid and confused, the work-girl could not
      withdraw her eyes from Rodin&rsquo;s; her heart beat violently, as at the
      coming of some great danger, and, as the excellent creature feared only
      for those she loved, she approached Adrienne involuntarily, keeping her
      eyes fixed on Rodin. The Jesuit was too good a physiognomist not to
      perceive the formidable impression he had made, and he felt an increase of
      his instinctive aversion for the sempstress. Instead of casting down his
      eyes, he appeared to examine her with such sustained attention, that
      Mdlle. de Cardoville was astonished at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my dear girl,&rdquo; said Rodin, as if recalling
      his recollections, and addressing himself to Mother Bunch, &ldquo;I beg
      your pardon&mdash;but I think&mdash;if I am not deceived&mdash;did you not
      go a few days since to St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, hard by?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, it was you. Where then was my head?&rdquo; cried Rodin.
      &ldquo;It was you&mdash;I should have guessed it sooner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what do you speak, sir?&rdquo; asked Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are right, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said Rodin, pointing
      to the hunchback. &ldquo;She has indeed a noble heart, such as we seek. If
      you knew with what dignity, with what courage this poor girl, who was out
      of work and, for her, to want work is to want everything&mdash;if you
      knew, I say, with what dignity she rejected the shameful wages that the
      superior of the convent was unprincipled enough to offer, on condition of
      her acting as a spy in a family where it was proposed to place her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is infamous!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, with
      disgust. &ldquo;Such a proposal to this poor girl&mdash;to her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, bitterly, &ldquo;I had no work, I
      was poor, they did not know me&mdash;and they thought they might propose
      anything to the likes of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;that it was a double
      baseness on the part of the superior, to offer such temptation to misery,
      and it was doubly noble in you to refuse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the sewing-girl, with modest embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am not to be intimidated,&rdquo; resumed Rod in. &ldquo;Praise
      or blame, I speak out roughly what I think. Ask this dear young lady,&rdquo;
      he added, with a glance at Adrienne. &ldquo;I tell you plainly, that I
      think as well of you as she does herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, dear,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;there are some sorts
      of praise which honor, recompense, and encourage; and M. Rodin&rsquo;s is
      of the number. I know it,&mdash;yes, I know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my dear young lady, you must not ascribe to me all the honor
      of this judgment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not this dear girl the adopted sister of Agricola Baudoin, the
      gallant workman, the energetic and popular poet? Is not the affection of
      such a man the best of guarantees, and does it not enable us to judge, as
      it were, by the label?&rdquo; added Rodin, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;for, before
      knowing this dear girl, I began to feel deeply interested in her, from the
      day that her adopted brother spoke to me about her. He expressed himself
      with so much warmth, so much enthusiasm, that I at once conceived an
      esteem for the person capable of inspiring so noble an attachment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of Adrienne, joined to another circumstance, had such an
      effect upon their hearer, that her pale face became crimson. The
      unfortunate hunchback loved Agricola, with love as passionate as it was
      secret and painful: the most indirect allusion to this fatal sentiment
      occasioned her the most cruel embarrassment. Now, the moment Mdlle. de
      Cardoville spoke of Agricola&rsquo;s attachment for Mother Bunch, the
      latter had encountered Rodin&rsquo;s observing and penetrating look fixed
      upon her. Alone with Adrienne, the sempstress would have felt only a
      momentary confusion on hearing the name of the smith; but unfortunately
      she fancied that the Jesuit, who already filled her with involuntary fear,
      had seen into her heart, and read the secrets of that fatal love, of which
      she was the victim. Thence the deep blushes of the poor girl, and the
      embarrassment so painfully visible, that Adrienne was struck with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subtle and prompt mind, like Rodin&rsquo;s on perceiving the smallest
      effect, immediately seeks the cause. Proceeding by comparison, the Jesuit
      saw on one side a deformed, but intelligent young girl, capable of
      passionate devotion; on the other, a young workman, handsome, bold, frank,
      and full of talent. &ldquo;Brought up together, sympathizing with each
      other on many points, there must be some fraternal affection between them,&rdquo;
      said he to himself; &ldquo;but fraternal affection does not blush, and the
      hunchback blushed and grew troubled beneath my look; does she, then, Love
      Agricola?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once on the scent of this discovery, Rodin wished to pursue the
      investigation. Remarking the surprise and visible uneasiness that Mother
      Bunch had caused in Adrienne, he said to the latter, with a smile, looking
      significantly at the needlewoman: &ldquo;You see, my dear young lady, how
      she blushes. The good girl is troubled by what we said of the attachment
      of this gallant workman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The needlewoman hung down her head, overcome with confusion. After the
      pause of a second, during which Rodin preserved silence, so as to give
      time for his cruel remark to pierce the heart of the victim, the savage
      resumed: &ldquo;Look at the dear girl! how embarrassed she appears!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, after another silence, perceiving that Mother Bunch from crimson
      had become deadly pale, and was trembling in all her limbs, the Jesuit
      feared he had gone too far, whilst Adrienne said to her friend, with
      anxiety: &ldquo;Why, dear child, are you so agitated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is clear enough,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, with an air of
      perfect simplicity; for having discovered what he wished to know, he now
      chose to appear unconscious. &ldquo;It is quite clear and plain. This good
      girl has the modesty of a kind and tender sister for a brother. When you
      praise him, she fancies that she is herself praised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20351.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is as modest as she is excellent,&rdquo; added Adrienne,
      taking bath of the girl&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;the least praise, either of
      her adopted brother or of herself, troubles her in this way. But it is
      mere childishness, and I must scold her for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville spoke sincerely, for the explanation given by Rodin
      appeared to her very plausible. Like all other persons who, dreading every
      moment the discovery of some painful secret have their courage as easily
      restored as shaken, Mother Bunch persuaded herself (and she needed to do
      so, to escape dying of shame), that the last words of Rodin were sincere,
      and that he had no idea of the love she felt for Agricola. So her agony
      diminished, and she found words to reply to Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, madame,&rdquo; she said timidly, &ldquo;I am so little
      accustomed to such kindness as that with which you overwhelm me, that I
      make a sorry return for all your goodness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindness, my poor girl?&rdquo; said Adrienne. &ldquo;I have done
      nothing for you yet. But, thank heaven! from this day I shall be able to
      keep my promise, and reward your devotion to me, your courageous
      resignation, your sacred love of labor, and the dignity of which you have
      given so many proofs, under the most cruel privations. In a word, from
      this day, if you do not object to it, we will part no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, you are too kind,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, in a trembling
      voice; &ldquo;but I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! be satisfied,&rdquo; said Adrienne, anticipating her meaning.
      &ldquo;If you accept my offer, I shall know how to reconcile with my
      desire (not a little selfish) of having you near me, the independence of
      your character, your habits of labor, your taste for retirement, and your
      anxiety to devote yourself to those who deserve commiseration; it is, I
      confess, by affording you the means of satisfying these generous
      tendencies, that I hope to seduce and keep you by me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have I done?&rdquo; asked the other, simply, &ldquo;to
      merit any gratitude from you? Did you not begin, on the contrary, by
      acting so generously to my adopted brother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I do not speak of gratitude,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;we
      are quits. I speak of friendship and sincere affection, which I now offer
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendship to me, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a charming smile, &ldquo;do
      not be proud because your position gives you the advantage. I have set my
      heart on having you for a friend, and you will see that it shall be so.
      But now that I think of it (a little late, you will say), what good wind
      brings you hither?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning M. Dagobert received a letter, in which he was
      requested to come to this place, to learn some news that would be of the
      greatest interest to him. Thinking it concerned Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters, he said to me: &lsquo;Mother Bunch, you have taken so much
      interest in those dear children, that you must come with me: you shall
      witness my joy on finding them, and that will be your reward.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne glanced at Rodin. The latter made an affirmative movement of the
      head, and answered: &ldquo;Yes, yes, my dear young lady: it was I who
      wrote to the brave soldier, but without signing the letter, or giving any
      explanation. You shall know why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear girl, why did you come alone?&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, madame! on arriving here, it was your kind reception that
      made me forget my fears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fears?&rdquo; asked Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing that you lived here, madame, I supposed the letter was from
      you; I told M. Dagobert so, and he thought the same. When we arrived, his
      impatience was so great, that he asked at the door if the orphans were in
      this house, and he gave their description. They told him no. Then, in
      spite of my supplications, he insisted on going to the convent to inquire
      about them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What imprudence!&rdquo; cried Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After what took place the other night, when he broke in,&rdquo;
      added Rodin, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in vain to tell him,&rdquo; returned Mother Bunch, &ldquo;that
      the letter did not announce positively, that the orphans would be
      delivered up to him; but that, no doubt, he would gain some information
      about them. He refused to hear anything, but said to me: &lsquo;If I
      cannot find them, I will rejoin you. But they were at the convent the day
      before yesterday, and now that all is discovered, they cannot refuse to
      give them up&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with such a man there is no disputing!&rdquo; said Rodin, with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they will not recognize him!&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      remembering Baleinier&rsquo;s threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not likely,&rdquo; replied Rodin; &ldquo;they will only
      refuse him admittance. That will be, I hope, the worst misfortune that
      will happen. Besides, the magistrate will soon be here with the girls. I
      am no longer wanted: other cares require my attention. I must seek out
      Prince Djalma. Only tell me, my dear young lady, where I shall find you,
      to keep you informed of my discoveries, and to take measures with regard
      to the young prince, if my inquiries, as I hope, shall be attended with
      success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find me in my new house, Rue d&rsquo;Anjou, formerly
      Beaulieu House. But now I think of it,&rdquo; said Adrienne, suddenly,
      after some moments of reflection, &ldquo;it would not be prudent or
      proper, on many accounts, to lodge the Prince Djalma in the pavilion I
      occupied at Saint-Dizier House. I saw, some time ago, a charming little
      house, all furnished and ready; it only requires some embellishments, that
      could be completed in twenty four hours, to make it a delightful
      residence. Yes, that will be a thousand times preferable,&rdquo; added
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, after a new interval of silence; &ldquo;and I shall
      thus be able to preserve the strictest incognito.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Rodin, whose projects would be much impeded by
      this new resolution of the young lady; &ldquo;you do not wish him to know
      who you are?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Prince Djalma to know absolutely nothing of the anonymous
      friend who comes to his aid; I desire that my name should not be
      pronounced before him, and that he should not even know of my existence&mdash;at
      least, for the present. Hereafter&mdash;in a month, perhaps&mdash;I will
      see; circumstances will guide me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this incognito,&rdquo; said Rodin, hiding his disappointment,
      &ldquo;will be difficult to preserve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the prince had inhabited the lodge, I agree with you; the
      neighborhood of my aunt would have enlightened him, and this fear is one
      of the reasons that have induced me to renounce my first project. But the
      prince will inhabit a distant quarter&mdash;the Rue Blanche. Who will
      inform him of my secret? One of my old friends, M. Norval&mdash;you, sir&mdash;and
      this dear girl,&rdquo; pointing to Mother Bunch, &ldquo;on whose
      discretion I can depend as on your own, will be my only confidants. My
      secret will then be quite safe. Besides, we will talk further on this
      subject to-morrow. You must begin by discovering the retreat of this
      unfortunate young prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, though much vexed at Adrienne&rsquo;s subtle determination with
      regard to Djalma, put the best face on the matter, and replied: &ldquo;Your
      intentions shall be scrupulously fulfilled, my dear young lady; and
      to-morrow, with your leave, I hope to give you a good account of what you
      are pleased to call my providential mission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then, I shall expect you with impatience,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, to Rodin, affectionately. &ldquo;Permit me always to rely upon
      you, as from this day you may count upon me. You must be indulgent with
      me, sir; for I see that I shall yet have many counsels, many services to
      ask of you&mdash;though I already owe you so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never owe me enough, my dear young lady, never enough,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, as he moved discreetly towards the door, after bowing to
      Adrienne. At the very moment he was going out, he found himself face to
      face with Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa! at last I have caught one!&rdquo; shouted the soldier, as
      he seized the Jesuit by the collar with a vigorous hand.

      CHAPTER XXXVII. EXCUSES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n seeing Dagobert
      grasp Rodin so roughly by the collar, Mdlle. de Cardoville exclaimed in
      terror, as she advanced several steps towards the soldier: &ldquo;In the
      name of Heaven, sir! what are you doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo; echoed the soldier, harshly, without
      relaxing his hold on Rodin, and turning his head towards Adrienne, whom he
      did not know; &ldquo;I take this opportunity to squeeze the throat of one
      of the wretches in the band of that renegade, until he tells me where my
      poor children are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You strangle me,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, in a stifled voice, as he
      tried to escape from the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the orphans, since they are not here, and the convent
      door has been closed against me?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in a voice of
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; gasped Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is dreadful!&rdquo; said Adrienne, as, pale and trembling,
      she held up her clasped hands to Dagobert. &ldquo;Have mercy, sir! listen
      to me! listen to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, seizing with her weak hands
      the soldier&rsquo;s arm, and showing him Adrienne, &ldquo;this is Mdlle.
      de Cardoville. What violence in her presence! and then, you are deceived
      doubtless!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Mdlle. de Cardoville, the benefactress of his son, the
      soldier turned round suddenly, and loosened his hold on Rodin. The latter,
      crimson with rage and suffocation, set about adjusting his collar and his
      cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame,&rdquo; said Dagobert, going towards
      Adrienne, who was still pale with fright; &ldquo;I did not known who you
      were, and the first impulse of anger quite carried me away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has this gentleman done to you?&rdquo; said Adrienne.
      &ldquo;If you had listened to me, you would have learned&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me if I interrupt you, madame,&rdquo; said the soldier to
      Adrienne, in a hollow voice. Then addressing himself to Rodin, who had
      recovered his coolness, he added: &ldquo;Thank the lady, and begone!&mdash;If
      you remain here, I will not answer for myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word only, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that if you remain, I will not answer for myself!&rdquo;
      cried Dagobert, stamping his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, tell me the cause of this anger,&rdquo;
      resumed Adrienne; &ldquo;above all, do not trust to appearances. Calm
      yourself, and listen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm myself, madame!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in despair; &ldquo;I
      can think only of one thing, ma dame&mdash;of the arrival of Marshal Simon&mdash;he
      will be in Paris to-day or to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said Adrienne. Rodin started with surprise
      and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday evening,&rdquo; proceeded Dagobert, &ldquo;I received a
      letter from the marshal: he has landed at Havre. For three days I have
      taken step after step, hoping that the orphans would be restored to me, as
      the machinations of those wretches have failed.&rdquo; He pointed to Rodin
      with a new gesture of impatience. &ldquo;Well! it is not so. They are
      conspiring some new infamy. I am prepared for anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Rodin advancing, &ldquo;permit me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, whose irritation and anxiety
      redoubled, as he thought how at any moment Marshal Simon might arrive in
      Paris. &ldquo;Begone! Were it not for this lady, I would at least be
      revenged on some one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin made a nod of intelligence to Adrienne, whom he approached
      prudently, and, pointing to Dagobert with a gesture of affectionate
      commiseration, he said to the latter: &ldquo;I will leave you, sir, and
      the more willingly, as I was about to withdraw when you entered.&rdquo;
      Then, coming still closer to Mdlle. de Cardoville, the Jesuit whispered to
      her, &ldquo;Poor soldier! he is beside himself with grief, and would be
      incapable of hearing me. Explain it all to him, my dear young lady; he
      will be nicely caught,&rdquo; added he, with a cunning air. &ldquo;But in
      the meantime,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, feeling in the side-pocket of his
      great-coat and taking out a small parcel, &ldquo;let me beg you to give
      him this, my dear young lady. It is my revenge, and a very good one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Adrienne, holding the little parcel in her hand looked at the
      Jesuit with astonishment, the latter laying his forefinger upon his lip,
      as if recommending silence, drew backward on tiptoe to the door, and went
      out after again pointing to Dagobert with a gesture of pity; while the
      soldier, in sullen dejection, with his head drooping, and his arms crossed
      upon his bosom, remained deaf to the sewing-girl&rsquo;s earnest
      consolations. When Rodin had left the room, Adrienne, approaching the
      soldier, said to him, in her mild voice, with an expression of deep
      interest, &ldquo;Your sudden entry prevented my asking you a question that
      greatly concerns me. How is your wound?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, madame,&rdquo; said Dagobert, starting from his painful
      lethargy, &ldquo;it is of no consequence, but I have not time to think of
      it. I am sorry to have been so rough in your presence, and to have driven
      away that wretch; but &lsquo;tis more than I could master. At sight of
      those people, my blood is all up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, believe me, you have been too hasty in your judgment. The
      person who was just now here&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too hasty, madame! I do not see him to-day for the first time. He
      was with that renegade the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt!&mdash;and yet he is an honest and excellent man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; cried Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for at this moment he is busy about only one thing restoring
      to you those dear children!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; repeated Dagobert, as if he could not believe what he
      heard. &ldquo;He restore me my children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and sooner, perhaps, than you think for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Dagobert, abruptly, &ldquo;he deceives you. You
      are the dupe of that old rascal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Adrienne, shaking her head, with a smile. &ldquo;I
      have proofs of his good faith. First of all, it is he who delivers me from
      this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; said Dagobert, quite confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; and here is, perhaps, something that will reconcile you
      to him,&rdquo; said Adrienne, as she delivered the small parcel which
      Rodin had given her as he went out. &ldquo;Not wishing to exasperate you
      by his presence, he said to me: &lsquo;Give this to that brave soldier; it
      is my revenge.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert looked at Mdlle. de Cardoville with surprise, as he mechanically
      opened the little parcel. When he had unfolded it, and discovered his own
      silver cross, black with age, and the old red, faded ribbon, treasures
      taken from him at the White Falcon Inn, at the same time as his papers, he
      exclaimed in a broken voice: &ldquo;My cross! my cross! It is my cross!&rdquo;
      In the excitement of his joy, he pressed the silver star to his gray
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne and the other were deeply affected by the emotion of the old
      soldier, who continued, as he ran towards the door by which Rodin had gone
      out: &ldquo;Next to a service rendered to Marshal Simon, my wife, or son,
      nothing could be more precious to me. And you answer for this worthy man,
      madame, and I have ill used him in your presence! Oh! he is entitled to
      reparation, and he shall have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Dagobert left the room precipitately, hastened through two
      other apartments, gained the staircase, and descending it rapidly,
      overtook Rodin on the lowest step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the soldier to him, in an agitated voice, as he
      seized him by the arm, &ldquo;you must come upstairs directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should make up your mind to one thing or the other, my dear
      sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, stopping good-naturedly; &ldquo;one moment you
      tell me to begone, and the next to return. How are we to decide?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now, sir, I was wrong; and when I am wrong, I acknowledge it.
      I abused and ill-treated you before witnesses; I will make you my
      apologies before witnesses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir&mdash;I am much obliged to you&mdash;I am in a
      hurry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help your being in a hurry. I tell you, I must have you
      come upstairs, directly&mdash;or else&mdash;or else,&rdquo; resumed
      Dagobert, taking the hand of the Jesuit, and pressing it with as much
      cordiality as emotion, &ldquo;or else the happiness you have caused the in
      returning my cross will not be complete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my good friend, let us go up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not only have you restored me my cross, for which I have wept
      many tears, believe me, unknown to any one,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, much
      affected; &ldquo;but the young lady told me, that, thanks to you, those
      poor children but tell me&mdash;no false joy-is it really true?&mdash;My
      God! is it really true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! Mr. Inquisitive,&rdquo; said Rodin, with a cunning smile.
      Then he added: &ldquo;Be perfectly tranquil, my growler; you shall have
      your two angels back again.&rdquo; And the Jesuit began to ascend the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they be restored to me to-day?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, stopping
      Rodin abruptly, by catching hold of his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, really, my good friend,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, &ldquo;let us
      come to the point. Are we to go up or down? I do not find fault, but you
      turn me about like a teetotum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. We shall be better able to explain things upstairs.
      Come with me&mdash;quick! quick!&rdquo; said Dagobert, as, taking the
      Jesuit by the arm, he hurried him along, and brought him triumphantly into
      the room, where Adrienne and Mother Bunch had remained in much surprise at
      the soldier&rsquo;s sudden disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is! here he is!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, as he entered.
      &ldquo;Luckily, I caught him at the bottom of the stairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have made me come up at a fine pace!&rdquo; added Rodin,
      pretty well out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a grave voice, &ldquo;I declare,
      in presence of all, that I was wrong to abuse and ill-treat you. I make
      you my apology for it, sir; and I acknowledge, with joy, that I owe you&mdash;much&mdash;oh!
      very much and when I owe, I pay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Dagobert held out his honest hand to Rodin, who pressed it in a
      very affable manner, and replied: &ldquo;Now, really&mdash;what is all
      this about? What great service do you speak of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This!&rdquo; said Dagobert, holding up the cross before Rodin&rsquo;s
      eyes. &ldquo;You do not know, then, what this cross is to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, supposing you would set great store by it, I
      intended to have the pleasure of delivering it myself. I had brought it
      for that purpose; but, between ourselves, you gave me so warm a reception,
      that I had not the time&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dagobert, in confusion, &ldquo;I assure you that I
      sincerely repent of what I have done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, my good friend; do not say another word about it. You
      were then much attached to this cross?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attached to it, sir!&rdquo; cried Dagobert. &ldquo;Why, this cross,&rdquo;
      and he kissed it as he spoke, &ldquo;is my relic. He from whom it came was
      my saint&mdash;my hero&mdash;and he had touched it with his hand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Rodin, feigning to regard the cross with as much
      curiosity as respectful admiration; &ldquo;did Napoleon&mdash;the Great
      Napoleon&mdash;indeed touch with his own hand&mdash;that victorious hand!&mdash;this
      noble star of honor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, with his own hand. He placed it there upon my bleeding
      breast, as a cure for my fifth wound. So that, you see, were I dying of
      hunger, I think I should not hesitate betwixt bread and my cross&mdash;that
      I might, in any case, have it on my heart in death. But, enough&mdash;enough!
      let us talk of something else. It is foolish in an old soldier, is it not?&rdquo;
      added Dagobert, drawing his hand across his eyes, and then, as if ashamed
      to deny what he really felt: &ldquo;Well, then! yes,&rdquo; he resumed,
      raising his head proudly, and no longer seeking to conceal the tears that
      rolled down his cheek; &ldquo;yes, I weep for joy, to have found my cross&mdash;my
      cross, that the Emperor gave me with his victorious hand, as this worthy
      man has called it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then blessed be my poor old hand for having restored you the
      glorious treasure!&rdquo; said Rodin, with emotion. &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo;
      he added, &ldquo;the day will be a good one for everybody&mdash;as I
      announced to you this morning in my letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That letter without a signature?&rdquo; asked the soldier, more and
      more astonished. &ldquo;Was it from you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who wrote it. Only, fearing some new snare of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      I did not choose, you understand, to explain myself more clearly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;I shall see&mdash;my orphans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin nodded affirmatively, with an expression of great good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently&mdash;perhaps immediately,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with
      smile. &ldquo;Well! was I right in telling you that you had not judged
      this gentleman fairly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he not tell me this when I came in?&rdquo; cried Dagobert,
      almost beside himself with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one difficulty in the way, my good friend,&rdquo; said
      Rodin; &ldquo;it was, that when you came in, you nearly throttled me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; I was too hasty. Once more, I ask your pardon. But was I to
      blame? I had only seen you with that Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and in the
      first moment&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This dear young lady,&rdquo; said Rodin, bowing to Adrienne,
      &ldquo;will tell you that I have been, without knowing it, the accomplice
      IN many perfidious actions; but as soon as I began to see my way through
      the darkness, I quitted the evil course on which I had entered, and
      returned to that which is honest, just and true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne nodded affirmatively to Dagobert, who appeared to consult her
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not sign the letter that I wrote to you, my good friend,
      it was partly from fear that my name might inspire suspicion; and if I
      asked you to come hither, instead of to the convent, it was that I had
      some dread&mdash;like this dear young lady&mdash;lest you might be
      recognized by the porter or by the gardener, your affair of the other
      night rendering such a recognition somewhat dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But M. Baleinier knows all; I forgot that,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with uneasiness. &ldquo;He threatened to denounce M. Dagobert and his son,
      if I made any complaint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, my dear young lady; it will soon be for you to
      dictate conditions,&rdquo; replied Rodin. &ldquo;Leave that to me; and as
      for you, my good friend, your torments are now finished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;an upright and worthy magistrate
      has gone to the convent, to fetch Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters. He will
      bring them hither; but he thought with me, that it would be most proper
      for them to take up their abode in my house. I cannot, however, come to
      this decision without your consent, for it is to you that these orphans
      were entrusted by their mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to take her place with regard to them, madame?&rdquo;
      replied Dagobert. &ldquo;I can only thank you with all my heart, for
      myself and for the children. But, as the lesson has been a sharp one, I
      must beg to remain at the door of their chamber, night and day. If they go
      out with you, I must be allowed to follow them at a little distance, so as
      to keep them in view, just like Spoil-sport, who has proved himself a
      better guardian than myself. When the marshal is once here&mdash;it will
      be in a day or two&mdash;my post will be relieved. Heaven grant it may be
      soon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Rodin, in a firm voice, &ldquo;heaven grant he
      may arrive soon, for he will have to demand a terrible reckoning of the
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, for the persecution of his daughters; and yet the
      marshal does not know all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you tremble for the renegade?&rdquo; asked
      Dagobert, as he thought how the marquis would soon find himself face to
      face with the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never care for cowards and traitors,&rdquo; answered Rodin;
      &ldquo;and when Marshal Simon returns&mdash;&rdquo; Then, after a pause of
      some seconds, he continued: &ldquo;If he will do me the honor to hear me,
      he shall be edified as to the conduct of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. The
      marshal knows that his dearest friends, as well as himself, have been
      victims of the hatred of that dangerous man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yourself, for instance,&rdquo; replied Rodin; &ldquo;you are
      an example of what I advance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was mere chance, that brought about the scene at
      the White Falcon Inn, near Leipsic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you of that scene?&rdquo; said Dagobert in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you accepted the challenge of Morok,&rdquo; continued the
      Jesuit, without answering Dagobert&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;and so fell
      into a trap, or else refused it, and were then arrested for want of
      papers, and thrown into prison as a vagabond, with these poor children.
      Now, do you know the object of this violence? It was to prevent your being
      here on the 13th of February.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the more I hear, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;the more I
      am alarmed at the audacity of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and the extent of
      the means he has at his command. Really,&rdquo; she resumed, with
      increasing surprise, &ldquo;if your words were not entitled to absolute
      belief&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would doubt their truth, madame?&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;It
      is like me. Bad as he is. I cannot think that this renegade had relations
      with a wild-beast showman as far off as Saxony; and then, how could he
      know that I and the children were to pass through Leipsic? It is
      impossible, my good man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, sir,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, &ldquo;I fear that you are
      deceived by your dislike (a very legitimate one) of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      and that you ascribe to him an almost fabulous degree of power and extent
      of influence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which Rodin looked first at
      Adrienne and then at Dagobert, with a kind of pity, he resumed. &ldquo;How
      could the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny have your cross in his possession, if he
      had no connection with Morok?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, sir,&rdquo; said Dagobert; &ldquo;joy prevented me
      from reflecting. But how indeed, did my cross come into your hands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By means of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s having precisely
      those relations with Leipsic, of which you and the young lady seem to
      doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did my cross get to Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me; you were arrested at Leipsic for want of papers&mdash;is
      it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I could never understand how my passports and money
      disappeared from my knapsack. I thought I must have had the misfortune to
      lose them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin shrugged his shoulders, and replied: &ldquo;You were robbed of them
      at the White Falcon Inn, by Goliath, one of Morok&rsquo;s servants, and
      the latter sent the papers and the cross to the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, to
      prove that he had succeeded in executing his orders with respect to the
      orphans and yourself. It was the day before yesterday, that I obtained the
      key of that dark machination. Cross and papers were amongst the stores of
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny; the papers formed a considerable bundle, and he
      might have missed them; but, hoping to see you this morning, and knowing
      how a soldier of the Empire values his cross, his sacred relic, as you
      call it, my good friend&mdash;I did not hesitate. I put the relic into my
      pocket. &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it is only restitution,
      and my delicacy perhaps exaggerates this breach of trust.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have done a better action,&rdquo; said Adrienne;
      &ldquo;and, for my part, because of the interest I feel for M. Dagobert&mdash;I
      take it as a personal favor. But, sir,&rdquo; after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, she resumed with anxiety: &ldquo;What terrible power must be at
      the command of M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny, for him to have such extensive and
      formidable relations in a foreign country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Rodin, in a low voice, and looking round him
      with an air of alarm. &ldquo;Silence! In heaven&rsquo;s name do not ask me
      about it!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. REVELATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>dlle. de
      Cardoville, much astonished at the alarm displayed by Rodin, when she had
      asked him for some explanation of the formidable and far reaching power of
      the Abby d&rsquo;Aigrigny, said to him: &ldquo;Why, sir, what is there so
      strange in the question that I have just asked you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Rodin cast his looks all around, with well
      feigned uneasiness, and replied in a whisper: &ldquo;Once more, madame, do
      not question me on so fearful a subject. The walls of this house may have
      ears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne and Dagobert looked at each other with growing surprise. Mother
      Bunch, by an instinct of incredible force, continued to regard Rodin with
      invincible suspicion. Sometimes she stole a glance at him, as if trying to
      penetrate the mask of this man, who filled her with fear. At one moment,
      the Jesuit encountered her anxious gaze, obstinately fixed upon him;
      immediately he nodded to her with the greatest amenity. The young girl,
      alarmed at finding herself observed, turned away with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear young lady,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, with a sigh, as
      he saw Mdlle. de Cardoville astonished at his silence; &ldquo;do not
      question me on the subject of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s power!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, to persist, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;why this
      hesitation to answer? What do you fear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear young lady,&rdquo; said Rodin, shuddering, &ldquo;those
      people are so powerful! their animosity is so terrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, sir; I owe you too much, for my support ever to fail
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear young lady,&rdquo; cried Rodin, as if hurt by the
      supposition; &ldquo;think better of me, I entreat you. Is it for myself
      that I fear?&mdash;No, no; I am too obscure, too inoffensive; but it is
      for you, for Marshal Simon, for the other members of your family, that all
      is to be feared. Oh, my dear young lady! let me beg you to ask no
      questions. There are secrets which are fatal to those who possess them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, is it not better to know the perils with which one is
      threatened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you know the manoeuvres of your enemy, you may at least defend
      yourself,&rdquo; said Dagobert. &ldquo;I prefer an attack in broad
      daylight to an ambuscade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I assure you,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, &ldquo;the few words you
      have spoken cause me a vague uneasiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I must, my dear young lady,&rdquo; replied the Jesuit,
      appearing to make a great effort, &ldquo;since you do not understand my
      hints, I will be more explicit; but remember,&rdquo; added he, in a deeply
      serious tone, &ldquo;that you have persevered in forcing me to tell you
      what you had perhaps better not have known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Sir, I pray you speak,&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing about him Adrienne, Dagobert, and Mother Bunch, Rodin said to them
      in a low voce, and with a mysterious air: &ldquo;Have you never heard of a
      powerful association, which extends its net over all the earth, and counts
      its disciples, agents, and fanatics in every class of society which has
      had, and often has still, the ear of kings and nobles&mdash;which, in a
      word, can raise its creatures to the highest positions, and with a word
      can reduce them again to the nothingness from which it alone could uplift
      them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, sir!&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;what formidable
      association? Until now I never heard of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you; and yet your ignorance on this subject greatly
      astonishes me, my dear young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should it astonish you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you lived some time with your aunt, and must have often
      seen the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived at the princess&rsquo;s, but not with her; for a thousand
      reasons she had inspired me with warrantable aversion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, my dear young lady, my remark was ill-judged. It was
      there, above all, and particularly in your presence, that they would keep
      silence with regard to this association&mdash;and yet to it alone did the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier owe her formidable influence in the world, during
      the last reign. Well, then; know this&mdash;it is the aid of that
      association which renders the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny so dangerous a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By it he was enabled to follow and to reach divers members of your
      family, some in Siberia, some in India, others on the heights of the
      American mountains; but, as I have told you, it was only the day before
      yesterday, and by chance, that, examining the papers of Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      I found the trace of his connection with this Company, of which he is the
      most active and able chief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the name, sir, the name of this Company?&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20367.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! it is&mdash;&rdquo; but Rodin stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; repeated Adrienne, who was now as much interested as
      Dagobert and the sempstress; &ldquo;it is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked round him, beckoned all the actors in this scene to draw
      nearer, and said in a whisper, laying great stress upon the words: &ldquo;It
      is&mdash;the Society of Jesus!&rdquo; and he again shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jesuits!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, unable to restrain
      a burst of laughter, which was the more buoyant, as, from the mysterious
      precautions of Rodin, she had expected some very different revelation.
      &ldquo;The Jesuits!&rdquo; she resumed, still laughing. &ldquo;They have
      no existence, except in books; they are frightful historical personages,
      certainly; but why should you put forward Madame de Saint-Dizier and M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      in that character? Such as they are, they have done quite enough to
      justify my aversion and disdain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After listening in silence to Mdlle. de Cardoville Rodin continued, with a
      grave and agitated air: &ldquo;Your blindness frightens me, my dear, young
      lady; the past should have given you some anxiety for the future, since,
      more than any one, you have already suffered from the fatal influence of
      this Company, whose existence you regard as a dream!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sir?&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a smile, although a little
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under what circumstances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me this question! my dear young lady! you ask me this
      question!&mdash;and yet you have been confined here as a mad person! Is it
      not enough to tell you that the master of this house is one of the most
      devoted lay members of the Company, and therefore the blind instrument of
      the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Adrienne, this time without smiling, &ldquo;Dr.
      Baleinier&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obeyed the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, the most formidable chief of that
      formidable society. He employs his genius for evil; but I must confess he
      is a man of genius. Therefore, it is upon him that you and yours must fix
      all your doubts and suspicions; it is against him that you must be upon
      your guard. For, believe me, I know him, and he does not look upon the
      game as lost. You must be prepared for new attacks, doubtless of another
      kind, but only the more dangerous on that account&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily, you give us notice,&rdquo; said Dagobert, &ldquo;and you
      will be on our side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do very little, my good friends; but that little is at the
      service of honest people,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a thoughtful air, completely
      persuaded by Rodin&rsquo;s air of conviction, &ldquo;I can explain the
      inconceivable influence that my aunt exercised in the world. I ascribed it
      chiefly to her relations with persons in power; I thought that she, like
      the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, was concerned in dark intrigues, for which
      religion served as a veil&mdash;but I was far from believing what you tell
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many things you have got to learn!&rdquo; resumed Rodin.
      &ldquo;If you knew, my dear young lady, with what art these people
      surround you, without your being aware of it, by agents devoted to
      themselves! Every one of your steps is known to them, when they have any
      interest in such knowledge. Thus, little by little, they act upon you&mdash;slowly,
      cautiously, darkly. They circumvent you by every possible means, from
      flattery to terror&mdash;seduce or frighten, in order at last to rule you,
      without your being conscious of their authority. Such is their object, and
      I must confess they pursue it with detestable ability.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin had spoken with so much sincerity, that Adrienne trembled; then,
      reproaching herself with these fears, she resumed: &ldquo;And yet, no&mdash;I
      can never believe in so infernal a power; the might of priestly ambition
      belongs to another age. Heaven be praised, it has disappeared forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, it is out of sight; for they now know how to
      disperse and disappear, when circumstances require it. But then are they
      the most dangerous; for suspicion is laid asleep, and they keep watch in
      the dark. Oh! my dear young lady, if you knew their frightful ability! In
      my hatred of all that is oppressive, cowardly, and hypocritical, I had
      studied the history of that terrible society, before I knew that the Abbe
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny belonged to it. Oh! it is dreadful. If you knew what
      means they employ! When I tell you that, thanks to their diabolical
      devices, the most pure and devoted appearances often conceal the most
      horrible snares.&rdquo; Rodin&rsquo;s eye rested, as if by chance, on the
      hunchback; but, seeing that Adrienne did not take the hint, the Jesuit
      continued: &ldquo;In a word&mdash;are you not exposed to their pursuits?&mdash;have
      they any interest in gaining you over?&mdash;oh! from that moment, suspect
      all that surround you, suspect the most noble attachments, the most tender
      affections, for these monsters sometimes succeed in corrupting your best
      friends, and making a terrible use of them, in proportion to the blindness
      of your confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is impossible,&rdquo; cried Adrienne, in horror. &ldquo;You
      must exaggerate. No! hell itself never dreamed of more frightful
      treachery!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my dear young lady! one of your relations, M. Hardy&mdash;the
      most loyal and generous-hearted man that could be&mdash;has been the
      victim of some such infamous treachery. Do you know what we learned from
      the reading of your ancestor&rsquo;s will? Why, that he died the victim of
      the malevolence of these people; and now, at the lapse of a hundred and
      fifty years, his descendants are still exposed to the hate of that
      indestructible society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! it terrifies me,&rdquo; said Adrienne, feeling her heart
      sink within her. &ldquo;But are there no weapons against such attacks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prudence, my dear young lady&mdash;the most watchful caution&mdash;the
      most incessant study and suspicion of all that approach you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But such a life would be frightful! It is a torture to be the
      victim of continual suspicions, doubts, and fears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt! They know it well, the wretches! That constitutes
      their strength. They often triumph by the very excess of the precautions
      taken against them. Thus, my dear young lady, and you, brave and worthy
      soldier, in the name of all that is dear to you, be on your guard, and do
      not lightly impart your confidence. Be on your guard, for you have nearly
      fallen the victims of those people. They will always be your implacable
      enemies. And you, also, poor, interesting girl!&rdquo; added the Jesuit,
      speaking to Mother Bunch, &ldquo;follow my advice&mdash;fear these people.
      Sleep, as the proverb says, with one eye open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sir!&rdquo; said the work-girl. &ldquo;What have I done? what
      have I to fear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done? Dear me! Do not you tenderly love this young
      lady, your protectress? have you not attempted to assist her? Are you not
      the adopted sister of the son of this intrepid soldier, the brave
      Agricola! Alas, poor, girl! are not these sufficient claims to their
      hatred, in spite of your obscurity? Nay, my dear young lady! do not think
      that I exaggerate. Reflect! only reflect! Think what I have just said to
      the faithful companion-in-arms of Marshal Simon, with regard to his
      imprisonment at Leipsic. Think what happened to yourself, when, against
      all law and reason, you were brought hither. Then you will see, that there
      is nothing exaggerated in the picture I have drawn of the secret power of
      this Company. Be always on your guard, and, in doubtful cases, do not fear
      to apply to me. In three days, I have learned enough by my own experience,
      with regard to their manner of acting, to be able to point out to you many
      a snare, device, and danger, and to protect you from them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any such case, sir,&rdquo; replied Mdlle. de Cardoville, &ldquo;my
      interests, as well as gratitude, would point to you as my best counsellor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the skillful tactics of the sons of Loyola, who sometimes
      deny their own existence, in order to escape from an adversary&mdash;and
      sometimes proclaim with audacity the living power of their organization,
      in order to intimidate the feeble-R-odin had laughed in the face of the
      bailiff of Cardoville, when the latter had spoken of the existence of the
      Jesuits; while now, at this moment, picturing their means of action, he
      endeavored, and he succeeded in the endeavor, to impregnate the mind of
      Mdlle. de Cardoville with some germs of doubt, which were gradually to
      develop themselves by reflection, and serve hereafter the dark projects
      that he meditated. Mother Bunch still felt considerable alarm with regard
      to Rodin. Yet, since she had heard the fatal powers of the formidable
      Order revealed to Adrienne, the young sempstress, far from suspecting the
      Jesuit of having the audacity to speak thus of a society of which he was
      himself a member, felt grateful to him, in spite of herself, for the
      important advice that he had just given her patroness. The side-glance
      which she now cast upon him (which Rodin also detected, for he watched the
      young girl with sustained attention), was full of gratitude, mingled with
      surprise. Guessing the nature of this impression, and wishing entirely to
      remove her unfavorable opinion, and also to anticipate a revelation which
      would be made sooner or later, the Jesuit appeared to have forgotten
      something of great importance, and exclaimed, striking his forehead:
      &ldquo;What was I thinking of?&rdquo; Then, speaking to Mother Bunch, he
      added: &ldquo;Do you know where your sister is, my dear girl?&rdquo;
      Disconcerted and saddened by this unexpected question, the workwoman
      answered with a blush, for she remembered her last interview with the
      brilliant Bacchanal Queen: &ldquo;I have not seen my sister for some days,
      sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear girl, she is not very comfortable,&rdquo; said Rodin;
      &ldquo;I promised one of her friends to send her some little assistance. I
      have applied to a charitable person, and that is what I received for her.&rdquo;
      So saying, he drew from his pocket a sealed roll of coin, which he
      delivered to Mother Bunch, who was now both surprised and affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a sister in trouble, and I know nothing of it?&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, hastily. &ldquo;This is not right of you, my child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not blame her,&rdquo; said Rodin. &ldquo;First of all, she did
      not know that her sister was in distress, and, secondly, she could not ask
      you, my dear young lady, to interest yourself about her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mdlle. de Cardoville looked at Rodin with astonishment, he added, again
      speaking to the hunchback: &ldquo;Is not that true, my dear girl!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the sempstress, casting down her eyes and
      blushing. Then she added, hastily and anxiously: &ldquo;But when did you
      see my sister, sir? where is she? how did she fall into distress?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that would take too long to tell you, my dear girl; but go as
      soon as possible to the greengrocer&rsquo;s in the Rue Clovis, and ask to
      speak to your sister as from M. Charlemagne or M. Rodin, which you please,
      for I am equally well known in that house by my Christian name as by my
      surname, and then you will learn all about it. Only tell your sister,
      that, if she behaves well, and keeps to her good resolutions, there are
      some who will continue to look after her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more surprised, Mother Bunch was about to answer Rodin, when the
      door opened, and M. de Gernande entered. The countenance of the magistrate
      was grave and sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, they are not with me,&rdquo; answered the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, where are they, sir? What have they done with them? The day
      before yesterday, they were in the convent!&rdquo; cried Dagobert,
      overwhelmed by this complete destruction of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the soldier pronounced these words, when, profiting by the
      impulse which gathered all the actors in this scene about the magistrate,
      Rodin withdrew discreetly towards the door, and disappeared without any
      one perceiving his absence. Whilst the soldier, thus suddenly thrown back
      to the depths of his despair, looked at M. de Gernande, waiting with
      anxiety for the answer, Adrienne said to the magistrate: &ldquo;But, sir,
      when you applied at the convent, what explanation did the superior give on
      the subject of these young girls?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady superior refused to give any explanation, madame. &lsquo;You
      pretend,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that the young persons of whom you speak
      are detained here against their will. Since the law gives you the right of
      entering this house, make your search.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, madame, please
      to answer me positively,&rsquo; said I to the superior; &lsquo;do you
      declare, that you know nothing of the young girls, whom I have come to
      claim?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have nothing to say on this subject, sir. You
      assert, that you are authorized to make a search: make it.&rsquo; Not
      being able to get any other explanation,&rdquo; continued the magistrate,
      &ldquo;I searched all parts of the convent, and had every door opened&mdash;but,
      unfortunately, I could find no trace of these young ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have sent them elsewhere,&rdquo; cried Dagobert; &ldquo;who
      knows?&mdash;perhaps, ill. They will kill them&mdash;O God! they will kill
      them!&rdquo; cried he, in a heart-rending tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After such a refusal, what is to be done? Pray, sir, give us your
      advice; you are our providence,&rdquo; said Adrienne, turning to speak to
      Rodin, who she fancied was behind her. &ldquo;What is your&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, perceiving that the Jesuit had suddenly disappeared, she said to
      Mother Bunch, with uneasiness: &ldquo;Where is M. Rodin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, madame,&rdquo; answered the girl, looking round her;
      &ldquo;he is no longer here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;to disappear so
      abruptly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you he was a traitor!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, stamping with
      rage; &ldquo;they are all in a plot together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville; &ldquo;do not think that.
      But the absence is not the less to be regretted, for, under these
      difficult circumstances, he might have given us very useful information,
      thanks to the position he occupied at M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, madame, that I rather reckoned upon it,&rdquo; said M.
      de Gernande; &ldquo;and I returned hither, not only to inform you of the
      fruitless result of my search, but also to seek from the upright and
      honorable roan, who so courageously unveiled these odious machinations,
      the aid of his counsels in this contingency.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, for the last few moments Dagobert was so completely
      absorbed in thought, that he paid no attention to the words of the
      magistrate, however important to him. He did not even perceive the
      departure of M. de Gernande, who retired after promising Adrienne that he
      would neglect no means to arrive at the truth, in regard to the
      disappearance of the orphans. Uneasy at this silence, wishing to quit the
      house immediately, and induce Dagobert to accompany her, Adrienne, after
      exchanging a rapid glance with Mother Bunch, was advancing towards the
      soldier, when hasty steps were heard from without the chamber, and a manly
      sonorous voice, exclaiming with impatience, &ldquo;Where is he&mdash;where
      is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of this voice, Dagobert seemed to rouse himself with a start,
      made a sudden bound, and with a loud cry, rushed towards the door. It
      opened. Marshal Simon appeared on the threshold!

      CHAPTER XXXIX. PIERRE SIMON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>arshal Pierre
      Simon, Duke de Ligny, was a man of tall stature, plainly dressed in a blue
      frock-coat, buttoned up to the throat, with a red ribbon tied to the top
      buttonhole. You could not have wished to see a more frank, honest, and
      chivalrous cast of countenance than the marshal&rsquo;s. He had a broad
      forehead, an aquiline nose, a well formed chin, and a complexion bronzed
      by exposure to the Indian sun. His hair, cut very short, was inclined to
      gray about the temples; but his eyebrows were still as black as his large,
      hanging moustache. His walk was free and bold, and his decided movements
      showed his military impetuosity. A man of the people, a man of war and
      action, the frank cordiality of his address invited friendliness and
      sympathy. As enlightened as he was intrepid as generous as he was sincere,
      his manly, plebeian pride was the most remarkable part of his character.
      As others are proud of their high birth, so was he of his obscure origin,
      because it was ennobled by the fine qualities of his father, the rigid
      republican, the intelligent and laborious artisan, who, for the space of
      forty years, had been the example and the glory of his fellow-workmen. In
      accepting with gratitude the aristocratic title which the Emperor had
      bestowed upon him, Pierre Simon acted with that delicacy which receives
      from a friendly hand a perfectly useless gift, and estimates it according
      to the intention of the giver. The religious veneration of Pierre Simon
      for the Emperor had never been blind; in proportion as his devotion and
      love for his idol were instructive and necessary, his admiration was
      serious, and founded upon reason. Far from resembling those swashbucklers
      who love fighting for its own sake, Marshal Simon not only admired his
      hero as the greatest captain in the world, but he admired him, above all,
      because he knew that the Emperor had only accepted war in the hope of one
      day being able to dictate universal peace; for if peace obtained by glory
      and strength is great, fruitful, and magnificent, peace yielded by
      weakness and cowardice is sterile, disastrous, and dishonoring. The son of
      a workman, Pierre Simon still further admired the Emperor, because that
      imperial parvenu had always known how to make that popular heart beat
      nobly, and, remembering the people, from the masses of whom he first
      arose, had invited them fraternally to share in regal and aristocratic
      pomp.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20375.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When Marshal Simon entered the room, his countenance was much agitated. At
      sight of Dagobert, a flash of joy illumined his features; he rushed
      towards the soldier, extending his arms, and exclaimed, &ldquo;My friend!
      my old friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert answered this affectionate salute with silent emotion. Then the
      marshal, disengaging himself from his arms, and fixing his moist eyes upon
      him, said to him in so agitated a voice that his lips trembled, &ldquo;Well,
      didst arrive in time for the 13th of February?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, general; but everything is postponed for four months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;my wife?&mdash;my child?&rdquo; At this question Dagobert
      shuddered, hung down his head, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not, then, here?&rdquo; asked Simon, with more surprise
      than uneasiness. &ldquo;They told me they were not at your house, but that
      I should find you here&mdash;and I came immediately. Are they not with
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General,&rdquo; said Dagobert, becoming deadly pale; &ldquo;general&mdash;&rdquo;
      Drying the drops of cold sweat that stood upon his forehead, he was unable
      to articulate a word, for his voice was checked in his parched throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frighten me!&rdquo; exclaimed Pierre Simon, becoming pale as
      the soldier, and seizing him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Adrienne advanced, with a countenance full of grief and sympathy;
      seeing the cruel embarrassment of Dagobert, she wished to come to his
      assistance, and she said to Pierre Simon, in a mild but agitated voice,
      &ldquo;Marshal, I am Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;a relation of your dear
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre Simon turned around suddenly, as much struck with the dazzling
      beauty of Adrienne as with the words she had just pronounced. He stammered
      out in his surprise, &ldquo;You, madame&mdash;a relation&mdash;of my
      children!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid a stress on the last words, and looked at Dagobert in a kind of
      stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, marshal your children,&rdquo; hastily replied Adrienne;
      &ldquo;and the love of those charming twin sisters&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twin sisters!&rdquo; cried Pierre Simon, interrupting Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, with an outburst of joy impossible to describe. &ldquo;Two
      daughters instead of one! Oh! what happiness for their mother! Pardon me,
      madame, for being so impolite,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;and so little
      grateful for what you tell me. But you will understand it; I have been
      seventeen years without seeing my wife; I come, and I find three loved
      beings, instead of two. Thanks, madame: would I could express all the
      gratitude I owe you! You are our relation; this is no doubt your house; my
      wife and children are with you. Is it so? You think that my sudden
      appearance might be prejudicial to them? I will wait&mdash;but madame,
      you, that I am certain are good as fair&mdash;pity my impatience&mdash;will
      make haste to prepare them to receive me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more agitated, Dagobert avoided the marshal&rsquo;s gaze, and
      trembled like a leaf. Adrienne cast down her eyes without answering. Her
      heart sunk within her, at thought of dealing the terrible blow to Marshal
      Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, astonished at this silence, looking at Adrienne, then at the
      soldier, became first uneasy, and at last alarmed. &ldquo;Dagobert!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed, &ldquo;something is concealed from me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General!&rdquo; stammered the soldier, &ldquo;I assure you&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; cried Pierre Simon, &ldquo;I conjure you, in pity,
      speak to me frankly!&mdash;my anxiety is horrible. My first fears return
      upon me. What is it? Are my wife and daughters ill? Are they in danger?
      Oh! speak! speak!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughters, marshal,&rdquo; said Adrienne &ldquo;have been
      rather unwell, since their long journey&mdash;but they are in no danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heaven! it is my wife!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have courage, sir!&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, sadly. &ldquo;Alas!
      you must seek consolation in the affection of the two angels that remain
      to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General!&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a firm grave tone, &ldquo;I
      returned from Siberia&mdash;alone with your two daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And their mother! their mother!&rdquo; cried Simon, in a voice of
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I set out with the two orphans the day after her death,&rdquo; said
      the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; exclaimed Pierre Simon, overwhelmed by the stroke;
      &ldquo;dead?&rdquo; A mournful silence was the only answer. The marshal
      staggered beneath this unexpected shock, leaned on the back of a chair for
      support, and then, sinking into the seat, concealed his face with his
      hands. For same minutes nothing was heard but stifled sobs, for not only
      had Pierre Simon idolized his wife, but by one of those singular
      compromises, that a man long cruelly tried sometimes makes with destiny,
      Pierre Simon, with the fatalism of loving souls, thought he had a right to
      reckon upon happiness after so many years of suffering, and had not for a
      moment doubted that he should find his wife and child&mdash;a double
      consolation reserved to him after going through so much. Very different
      from certain people, whom the habit of misfortune renders less exacting,
      Simon had reckoned upon happiness as complete as had been his misery. His
      wife and child were the sole, indispensable conditions of this felicity,
      and, had the mother survived her daughters, she would have no more
      replaced them in his eyes than they did her. Weakness or avarice of the
      heart, so it was; we insist upon this singularity, because the
      consequences of these incessant and painful regrets exercised a great
      influence on the future life of Marshal Simon. Adrienne and Dagobert had
      respected the overwhelming grief of this unfortunate man. When he had
      given a free course to his tears, he raised his manly countenance, now of
      marble paleness, drew his hand across his blood-shot eyes, rose, and said
      to Adrienne, &ldquo;Pardon me, madame; I could not conquer my first
      emotion. Permit me to retire. I have cruel details to ask of the worthy
      friend who only quitted my wife at the last moment. Have the kindness to
      let me see my children&mdash;my poor orphans!&mdash;&rdquo; And the
      marshal&rsquo;s voice again broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshal,&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, &ldquo;just now we were
      expecting your dear children: unfortunately, we have been deceived in our
      hopes.&rdquo; Pierre Simon first looked at Adrienne without answering, as
      if he had not heard or understood.&mdash;&ldquo;But console yourself,&rdquo;
      resumed the young girl; &ldquo;we have yet no reason to despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To despair?&rdquo; repeated the marshaling by turns at Mdlle. de
      Cardoville despair?&mdash;&ldquo;of what, in heaven&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of seeing your children, marshal,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;the
      presence of their father will facilitate the search.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The search!&rdquo; cried Pierre Simon. &ldquo;Then, my daughters
      are not here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, at length; &ldquo;they have been
      taken from the affectionate care of the excellent man who brought them
      from Russia, to be removed to a convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; cried Pierre Simon, advancing towards Dagobert, with
      a menacing and terrible aspect; &ldquo;you shall answer to me for all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, do not blame him!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General,&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a tone of mournful resignation,
      &ldquo;I merit your anger. It is my fault. Forced to absent myself from
      Paris, I entrusted the children to my wife; her confessor turned her head,
      and persuaded her that your daughters would be better in a convent than at
      our house. She believed him, and let them be conveyed there. Now they say
      at the convent, that they do not know where they are. This is the truth:
      do what you will with me; I have only to silently endure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is infamous!&rdquo; cried Pierre Simon, pointing to Dagobert,
      with a gesture of despairing indignation. &ldquo;In whom can a man
      confide, if he has deceived me? Oh, my God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, marshal! do not blame him,&rdquo; repeated Mdlle. de
      Cardoville; &ldquo;do not think so! He has risked life and honor to rescue
      your children from the convent. He is not the only one who has failed in
      this attempt. Just now, a magistrate&mdash;despite his character and
      authority&mdash;was not more successful. His firmness towards the
      superior, his minute search of the convent, were all in vain. Up to this
      time it has been impossible to find these unfortunate children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s this convent!&rdquo; cried Marshal Simon, raising
      his head, his face all pale and agitated with grief and rage. &ldquo;Where
      is it? Do these vermin know what a father is, deprived of his children?&rdquo;
      At the moment when Marshal Simon, turning towards Dagobert, pronounced
      these words, Rodin, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, appeared at the
      open door of the chamber. On hearing the marshal&rsquo;s exclamation, he
      started with surprise, and a flash of diabolical joy lit up his grim
      countenance&mdash;for he had not expected to meet Pierre Simon so
      opportunely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville was the first to perceive the presence of Rodin. She
      exclaimed, as she hastened towards him: &ldquo;Oh! I was not deceived. He
      is still our providence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor children!&rdquo; said Rodin, in a low voice, to the young
      girls, as he pointed to Pierre Simon, &ldquo;this is your father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried Adrienne, following close upon Rose and Blanche.
      &ldquo;Your children are here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Simon turned round abruptly, his two daughters threw themselves into
      his arms. Here was a long silence, broken only by sobs, and kisses, and
      exclamations of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come forward, at least, and enjoy the good you have done!&rdquo;
      said Mdlle. de Cardoville, drying her eyes, and turning towards Rodin,
      who, leaning against the door, seemed to contemplate this scene with deep
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, at sight of Rodin bringing back the children, was at first
      struck with stupor, and unable to move a step; but hearing the words of
      Adrienne, and yielding to a burst of almost insane gratitude, he threw
      himself on his knees before the Jesuit, joined his hands together, and
      exclaimed in a broken voice: &ldquo;You have saved me, by bringing back
      these children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bless you, sir!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, yielding to the
      general current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friends, this is too much,&rdquo; said Rodin, as if his
      emotions were beyond his strength; &ldquo;this is really too much for me.
      Excuse me to the marshal, and tell him that I am repaid by the sight of
      his happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;let the marshal at least
      have the opportunity to see and know you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, remain! you that have saved us all!&rdquo; cried Dagobert,
      trying to stop Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providence, you know, my dear young lady, does not trouble itself
      about the good that is done, but the good that remains to do,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, with an accent of playful kindness. &ldquo;Must I not think of
      Prince Djalma? My task is not finished, and moments are precious. Come,&rdquo;
      he added, disengaging himself gently from Dagobert&rsquo;s hold, &ldquo;come
      the day has been as good a one as I had hoped.. The Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      is unmasked; you are free, my dear young lady; you have recovered your
      cross, my brave soldier; Mother Bunch is sure of a protectress; the
      marshal has found his children. I have my share in all these joys, it is a
      full share&mdash;my heart is satisfied. Adieu, my friends, till we meet
      again.&rdquo; So saying, Rodin waved his hand affectionately to Adrienne,
      Dagobert, and the hunchback, and withdrew, waving his hand with a look of
      delight on Marshal Simon, who, seated between his daughters, held them in
      his arms, and covered them with tears and kisses, remaining quite
      indifferent to all that was passing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after this scene, Mdlle. de Cardoville and the sempstress, Marshal
      Simon, his two daughters and Dagobert quitted Dr. Beleinier&rsquo;s
      asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terminating this episode, a few words by way of moral, with regard to
      lunatic asylums and convents may not be out of place. We have said, and we
      repeat, that the laws which apply to the superintendence of lunatic
      asylums appear to us insufficient. Facts that have recently transpired
      before the courts, and other facts that have been privately communicated
      to us, evidently prove this insufficiency. Doubtless, magistrates have
      full power to visit lunatic asylums. They are even required to make such
      visits. But we know, from the best authority, that the numerous and
      pressing occupations of magistrates, whose number is often out of
      proportion with the labor imposed upon them, render these inspections so
      rare, that they are, so to speak, illusory. It appears, therefore, to us
      advisable to institute a system of inspections, at least twice a month,
      especially designed for lunatic asylums, and entrusted to a physician and
      a magistrate, so that every complaint may be submitted to a double
      examination. Doubtless, the law is sufficient when its ministers are fully
      informed; but how many formalities, how many difficulties must be gone
      through, before they can be so, particularly when the unfortunate creature
      who needs their assistance, already suspected, isolated, and imprisoned,
      has no friend to come forward in defence, and demand, in his or her name,
      the protection of the authorities! Is it not imperative, therefore, on the
      civil power, to meet these necessities by a periodical and well-organized
      system of inspection?
    </p>
    <p>
      What we here say of lunatic asylums will apply with still greater force to
      convents for women, seminaries, and houses inhabited by religious bodies.
      Recent and notorious facts, with which all France has rung, have,
      unfortunately, proved that violence, forcible detention, barbarous usage,
      abduction of minors, and illegal imprisonment, accompanied by torture, are
      occurrences which, if not frequent, are at least possible in religious
      houses. It required singular accidents, audacious and cynical brutalities;
      to bring these detestable actions to public knowledge. How many other
      victims have been, and, perhaps still are, entombed in those large silent
      mansions, where no profane look may penetrate, and which, through the
      privileges of the clergy, escape the superintendence of the civil power.
      Is it not deplorable that these dwellings should not also be subject to
      periodical inspection, by visitors consisting, if it be desired, of a
      priest, a magistrate, and some delegate of the municipal authorities? If
      nothing takes place, but what is legal, human, and charitable, in these
      establishments, which have all the character, and incur all the
      responsibility, of public institutions, why this resistance, this furious
      indignation of the church party, when any mention is made of touching what
      they call their privileges? There is something higher than the
      constitutions devised at Rome. We mean the Law of France&mdash;the common
      law&mdash;which grants to all protection, but which, in return, exacts
      from all respect and obedience.

      CHAPTER XL. THE EAST INDIAN IN PARIS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ince three days,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had left Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s. The following scene
      took place in a little dwelling in the Rue Blanche, to which Djalma had
      been conducted in the name of his unknown protector. Fancy to yourself a
      pretty, circular apartment, hung with Indian drapery, with purple figures
      on a gray ground, just relieved by a few threads of gold. The ceiling,
      towards the centre, is concealed by similar hangings, tied together by a
      thick, silken cord; the two ends of this cord, unequal in length,
      terminated, instead of tassels, in two tiny Indian lamps of gold
      filigreed-work, marvellously finished. By one of those ingenious
      combinations, so common in barbarous countries, these lamps served also to
      burn perfumes. Plates of blue crystal, let in between the openings of the
      arabesque, and illumined by the interior light, shone with so limpid an
      azure, that the golden lamps seemed starred with transparent sapphires.
      Light clouds, of whitish vapor rose incessantly from these lamps, and
      spread all around their balmy odor.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20383.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Daylight was only admitted to this room (it was about two o&rsquo;clock in
      the afternoon) through a little greenhouse, on the other side of a door of
      plate-glass, made to slide into the thickness of the wall, by means of a
      groove. A Chinese shade was arranged so as to hide or replace this glass
      at pleasure. Some dwarf palm tress, plantains, and other Indian
      productions, with thick leaves of a metallic green, arranged in clusters
      in this conservatory, formed, as it were, the background to two large
      variegated bushes of exotic flowers, which were separated by a narrow
      path, paved with yellow and blue Japanese tiles, running to the foot of
      the glass. The daylight, already much dimmed by the leaves through which
      it passed, took a hue of singular mildness as it mingled with the azure
      lustre of the perfumed lamps, and the crimson brightness of the fire in
      the tall chimney of oriental porphyry. In the obscurity of this apartment,
      impregnated with sweet odors and the aromatic vapor of Persian tobacco, a
      man with brown, hanging locks, dressed in a long robe of dark green,
      fastened round the waist by a parti-colored sash, was kneeling upon a
      magnificent Turkey carpet, filling the golden bowl of a hookah; the long,
      flexible tube of this pipe, after rolling its folds upon the carpet, like
      a scarlet serpent with silver scales, rested between the slender fingers
      of Djalma, who was reclining negligently on a divan. The young prince was
      bareheaded; his jet-black hair, parted on the middle of his forehead,
      streamed waving about his face and neck of antique beauty&mdash;their warm
      transparent colors resembling amber or topaz. Leaning his elbow on a
      cushion, he supported his chin with the palm of his right hand. The
      flowing sleeve of his robe, falling back from his arm, which was round as
      that of a woman, revealed mysterious signs formerly tattooed there in
      India by a Thug&rsquo;s needle. The son of Radja-sing held in his left
      hand the amber mouthpiece of his pipe. His robe of magnificent cashmere,
      with a border of a thousand hues, reaching to his knee, was fastened about
      his slim and well-formed figure by the large folds of an orange-colored
      shawl. This robe was half withdrawn from one of the elegant legs of this
      Asiatic Antinous, clad in a kind of very close fitting gaiter of crimson
      velvet, embroidered with silver, and terminating in a small white morocco
      slipper, with a scarlet heel. At once mild and manly, the countenance of
      Djalma was expressive of that melancholy and contemplative calmness
      habitual to the Indian and the Arab, who possess the happy privilege of
      uniting, by a rare combination, the meditative indolence of the dreamer
      with the fiery energy of the man of action&mdash;now delicate, nervous,
      impressionable as women&mdash;now determined, ferocious, and sanguinary as
      bandits.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this semi-feminine comparison, applicable to the moral nature of the
      Arab and the Indian, so long as they are not carried away by the ardor of
      battle and the excitement of carnage, is almost equally applicable to
      their physical constitution; for if, like women of good blood, they have
      small extremities, slender limbs, fine and supple forms, this delicate and
      often charming exterior always covers muscles of steel, full of an
      elasticity, and vigor truly masculine. Djalma&rsquo;s oblong eyes, like
      black diamonds set in bluish mother-of-pearl, wandered mechanically from
      the exotic flowers to the ceiling; from time to time he raised the amber
      mouthpiece of the hookah to his lips; then, after a slow aspiration, half
      opening his rosy lips, strongly contrasted with the shining enamel of his
      teeth, he sent forth a little spiral line of smoke, freshly scented by the
      rose-water through which it had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I put more tobacco in the hookah?&rdquo; said the kneeling
      figure, turning towards Djalma, and revealing the marked and sinister
      features of Faringhea the Strangler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prince remained dumb, either that, from an oriental contempt for
      certain races, he disdained to answer the half-caste, or that, absorbed in
      his reverie, he did not even hear him. The Strangler became again silent;
      crouching cross-legged upon the carpet, with his elbows resting on his
      knees, and his chin upon his hands, he kept his eyes fixed on Djalma, and
      seemed to await the reply or the orders of him whose sire had been
      surnamed the Father of the Generous. How had Faringhea, the sanguinary
      worshipper of Bowanee, the Divinity of Murder, been brought to seek or to
      accept such humble functions? How came this man, possessed of no vulgar
      talents, whose passionate eloquence and ferocious energy had recruited
      many assassins for the service of the Good Work, to resign himself to so
      base a condition? Why, too, had this man, who, profiting by the young
      prince&rsquo;s blindness with regard to himself, might have so easily
      sacrificed him as an offering to Bowanee&mdash;why had he spared the life
      of Radja-sings son? Why, in fine, did he expose himself to such frequent
      encounters with Rodin, whom he had only known under the most unfavorable
      auspices? The sequel of this story will answer all these questions. We can
      only say at present, that, after a long interview with Rodin, two nights
      before, the Thug had quitted him with downcast eyes and cautious bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having remained silent for some time, Djalma, following with his eye
      the cloud of whitish smoke that he had just sent forth into space,
      addressed Faringhea, without looking at him, and said to him in the
      language, as hyperbolical as concise, of Orientals: &ldquo;Time passes.
      The old man with the good heart does not come. But he will come. His word
      is his word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His word is his word, my lord,&rdquo; repeated Faringhea, in an
      affirmative tone. &ldquo;When he came to fetch you, three days ago, from
      the house whither those wretches, in furtherance of their wicked designs,
      had conveyed you in a deep sleep&mdash;after throwing me, your watchful
      and devoted servant, into a similar state&mdash;he said to you: &lsquo;The
      unknown friend, who sent for you to Cardoville Castle, bids me come to
      you, prince. Have confidence, and follow me. A worthy abode is prepared
      for you.&rsquo;&mdash;And again, he said to you, my lord: &lsquo;Consent
      not to leave the house, until my return. Your interest requires it. In
      three days you will see me again, and then be restored to perfect freedom.&rsquo;
      You consented to those terms, my lord, and for three days you have not
      left the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wait for the old man with impatience,&rdquo; said Djalma,
      &ldquo;for this solitude is heavy with me. There must be so many things to
      admire in Paris. Above all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma did not finish the sentence, but relapsed into a reverie. After
      some moments&rsquo; silence, the son of Radja-sing said suddenly to
      Faringhea, in the tone of an impatient yet indolent sultan: &ldquo;Speak
      to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what shall I speak, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what you will,&rdquo; said Djalma, with careless contempt, as he
      fixed on the ceiling his eyes, half-veiled with languor. &ldquo;One
      thought pursues me&mdash;I wish to be diverted from it. Speak to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea threw a piercing glance on the countenance of the young Indian,
      and saw that his cheeks were colored with a slight blush. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo;
      said the half-caste, &ldquo;I can guess your thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma shook his head, without looking at the Strangler. The latter
      resumed: &ldquo;You are thinking of the women of Paris, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, slave!&rdquo; said Djalma, turning abruptly on the sofa,
      as if some painful wound had been touched to the quick. Faringhea obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of some moments. Djalma broke forth again with impatience,
      throwing aside the tube of the hookah, and veiling both eyes with his
      hands: &ldquo;Your words are better than silence. Cursed be my thoughts,
      and the spirit which calls up these phantoms!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you fly these thoughts, my lord? You are nineteen years
      of age, and hitherto all your youth has been spent in war and captivity.
      Up to this time, you have remained as chaste as Gabriel, that young
      Christian priest, who accompanied us on our voyage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Faringhea did not at all depart from his respectful deference for
      the prince, the latter felt that there was something of irony in the tone
      of the half-caste, as he pronounced the word &ldquo;chaste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma said to him with a mixture of pride and severity: &ldquo;I do not
      wish to pass for a barbarian, as they call us, with these civilized
      people; therefore I glory in my chastity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may perhaps love some woman, pure as was my mother when she
      married my father; and to ask for purity from a woman, a man must be
      chaste as she.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Faringhea could not refrain from a sardonic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh, slave?&rdquo; said the young prince, imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among civilized people, as you call them, my lord, the man who
      married in the flower of his innocence would be mortally wounded with
      ridicule.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false, slave! He would only be ridiculous if he married one
      that was not pure as himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my lord, he would not only be wounded&mdash;he would be
      killed outright, for he would be doubly and unmercifully laughed at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false! it is false. Where did you learn all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Parisian women at the Isle of France, and at
      Pondicherry, my lord. Moreover, I learned a good deal during our voyage; I
      talked with a young officer, while you conversed with the young priest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, like the sultans of our harems, civilized men require of women
      the innocence they have themselves lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They require it the more, the less they have of it, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To require without any return, is to act as a master to his slave;
      by what right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the right of the strongest&mdash;as it is among us, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do the women do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They prevent the men from being too ridiculous, when they marry, in
      the eyes of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they kill a woman that is false?&rdquo; said Djalma, raising
      himself abruptly, and fixing upon Faringhea a savage look, that sparkled
      with lurid fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They kill her, my lord, as with us&mdash;when they find her out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despots like ourselves! Why then do these civilized men not shut up
      their women, to force them to a fidelity which they do not practise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because their civilization is barbarous, and their barbarism
      civilized, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is sad enough, if true,&rdquo; observed Djalma, with a
      pensive air, adding, with a species of enthusiasm, employing, as usual,
      the mystic and figurative language familiar to the people of his country;
      &ldquo;yes, your talk afflicts me, slave&mdash;for two drops of dew
      blending in the cup of a flower are as hearts that mingle in a pure and
      virgin love; and two rays of light united in one inextinguishable flame,
      are as the burning and eternal joys of lovers joined in wedlock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma spoke of the pure enjoyments of the soul with inexpressible grace,
      yet it was when he painted less ideal happiness, that his eyes shone like
      stars; he shuddered slightly, his nostrils swelled, the pale gold of his
      complexion became vermilion, and the young prince sank into a deep
      reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea, having remarked this emotion, thus spoke: &ldquo;If, like the
      proud and brilliant king-bird of our woods, you prefer numerous and varied
      pleasures to solitary and monotonous amours&mdash;handsome, young, rich as
      you are, my lord, were you to seek out the seductive Parisians&mdash;voluptuous
      phantoms of your nights&mdash;charming tormentors of your dreams&mdash;were
      you to cast upon them looks bold as a challenge, supplicating as prayers,
      ardent as desires&mdash;do you not think that many a half-veiled eye would
      borrow fire from your glance? Then it would no longer be the monotonous
      delights of a single love, the heavy chain of our life&mdash;no, it would
      be the thousand pleasures of the harem&mdash;a harem peopled with free and
      proud beauties, whom happy love would make your slaves. So long
      constrained, there is no such thing as excess to you. Believe me, it would
      then be you, the ardent, the magnificent son of our country, that would
      become the love and pride of these women&mdash;the most seductive in the
      world, who would soon have for you no looks but those of languor and
      passion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma had listened to Faringhea with silent eagerness. The expression of
      his features had completely changed; it was no longer the melancholy and
      dreaming youth, invoking the sacred remembrance of his mother, and finding
      only in the dew of heaven, in the calyx of flowers, images sufficiently
      pure to paint the chastity of the love he dreamed of; it was no longer
      even the young man, blushing with a modest ardor at the thought of the
      permitted joys of a legitimate union. No! the incitements of Faringhea had
      kindled a subterraneous fire; the inflamed countenance of Djalma, his eyes
      now sparkling and now veiled, his manly and sonorous respiration,
      announced the heat of his blood, the boiling up of the passions, only the
      more energetic, that they had been hitherto restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, springing suddenly from the divan, supple, vigorous, and light as a
      young tiger, Djalma clutched Faringhea by the throat exclaiming: &ldquo;Thy
      words are burning poison!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Faringhea, without opposing the least
      resistance, &ldquo;your slave is your slave.&rdquo; This submission
      disarmed the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life belongs to you,&rdquo; repeated the half-caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I belong to you, slave!&rdquo; cried Djalma, repulsing him. &ldquo;Just
      now, I hung upon your lips, devouring your dangerous lies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lies, my lord? Only appear before these women, and their looks will
      confirm my words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These women love me!&mdash;me, who have only lived in war and in
      the woods?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought that you, so young, have already waged bloody war on
      men and tigers, will make them adore, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo;
    </p>

      &ldquo;I tell you, my lord, on seeing your hand, as delicate as theirs,
      but which has been so often bathed in hostile blood, they will wish to
      caress it; and they will kiss it again, when they think that, in our
      forests, with loaded rifle, and a poniard between your teeth, you smiled
      at the roaring of a lion or panther for whom you lay in wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am a savage&mdash;a barbarian.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;And for that very reason you will have them at your feet. They will
      feel themselves both terrified and charmed by all the violence and fury,
      the rage of jealousy, the passion and the love, to which a man of your
      blood, your youth, your ardor must be subject. To-day mild and tender,
      to-morrow fierce and suspicious, another time ardent and passionate, such
      you will be&mdash;and such you ought to be, if you wish to win them. Yes;
      let a kiss of rage be heard between two kisses: let a dagger glitter in
      the midst of caresses, and they will fall before you, palpitating with
      pleasure, love, and fear&mdash;and you will be to them, not a man, but a
      god.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost think so?&rdquo; cried Djalma, carried away in spite of
      himself by the Thug&rsquo;s wild eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, you feel, that I speak the truth,&rdquo; cried the
      latter, extending his arm towards the young Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Djalma, his eyes sparkling, his nostrils
      swelling, as he moved about the apartment with savage bounds. &ldquo;I
      know not if I possess my reason, or if I am intoxicated, but it seems to
      me that you speak truth. Yes, I feel that they will love me with madness
      and fury, because my love will be mad and furious they will tremble with
      pleasure and fear, because the very thought of it makes me tremble with
      delight and terror. Slave, it is true; there is something exciting and
      fearful in such a love!&rdquo; As he spoke forth these words, Djalma was
      superb in his impetuous sensuality. It is a rare thing to see a young man
      arrive in his native purity, at the age in which are developed, in all
      their powerful energy, those admirable instincts of love, which God has
      implanted in the heart of his creatures, and which, repressed, disguised,
      or perverted, may unseat the reason, or generate mad excesses and
      frightful crimes&mdash;but which, directed towards a great and noble
      passion, may and must, by their very violence, elevate man, through
      devotion and tenderness, to the limits of the ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this woman&mdash;this woman, before whom I am to tremble&mdash;and
      who, in turn, must tremble before me&mdash;where is she?&rdquo; cried
      Djalma, with redoubled excitement. &ldquo;Shall I ever find her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is a good deal, my lord,&rdquo; replied Faringhea, with his
      sardonic coolness; &ldquo;he who looks for one woman, will rarely succeed
      in this country; he who seeks women, is only at a loss to choose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the half-caste made this impertinent answer to Djalma, a very elegant
      blue-and-white carriage stopped before the garden-gate of the house, which
      opened upon a deserted street. It was drawn by a pair of beautiful
      blood-horses, of a cream color, with black manes and tails. The scutcheons
      on the harness were of silver, as were also the buttons of the servants&rsquo;
      livery, which was blue with white collars. On the blue hammercloth, also
      laced with white, as well as on the panels of the doors, were
      lozenge-shaped coats of arms, without crest or coronet, as usually borne
      by unmarried daughters of noble families. Two women were in this carriage&mdash;Mdlle.
      de Cardoville and Florine.

      CHAPTER XLI. RISING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o explain the
      arrival of Mdlle. de Cardoville at the garden-door of the house occupied
      by Djalma, we must cast a retrospective glance at previous events. On
      leaving Doctor Baleinier&rsquo;s, Mdlle. de Cardoville had gone to take up
      her residence in the Rue d&rsquo;Anjou. During the last few months of her
      stay with her aunt, Adrienne had secretly caused this handsome dwelling to
      be repaired and furnished, and its luxury and elegance were now increased
      by all the wonders of the lodge of Saint-Dizier House. The world found it
      very strange, that a lady of the age and condition of Mdlle. de Cardoville
      should take the resolution of living completely alone and free, and, in
      fact, of keeping house exactly like a bachelor, a young widow, or an
      emancipated minor. The world pretended not to know that Mdlle. de
      Cardoville possessed what is often wanting in men, whether of age or twice
      of age&mdash;a firm character, a lofty mind, a generous heart, strong and
      vigorous good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging that she would require faithful assistance in the internal
      management of her house, Adrienne had written to the bailiff of
      Cardoville, and his wife, old family servants, to come immediately to
      Paris: M. Dupont thus filled the office of steward, and Mme. Dupont that
      of housekeeper. An old friend of Adrienne&rsquo;s father, the Count de
      Montbron, an accomplished old man, once very much in fashion, and still a
      connoisseur in all sorts of elegances, had advised Adrienne to act like a
      princess, and take an equerry; recommended for this office a man of good
      rearing and ripe age, who, himself an amateur in horses, had been ruined
      in England, at Newmarket, the Derby, and Tattersall&rsquo;s, and reduced,
      as sometimes happened to gentlemen in that country, to drive the stage
      coaches, thus finding an honest method of earning his bread, and at the
      same time gratifying his taste for horses. Such was M. de Bonneville, M.
      de Montbron&rsquo;s choice. Both from age and habits, this equerry could
      accompany Mdlle. de Cardoville on horseback, and better than any one else,
      superintend the stable. He accepted, therefore, the employment with
      gratitude, and, thanks to his skill and attention, the equipages of Mdlle.
      de Cardoville were not eclipsed in style by anything of the kind in Paris.
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had taken back her women, Hebe, Georgette, and
      Florine. The latter was at first to have re-entered the service of the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier, to continue her part of spy for the superior of
      St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent; but, in consequence of the new direction given
      by Rodin to the Rennepont affair, it was decided that Florine, if
      possible, should return to the service of Mdlle. de Cardoville. This
      confidential place, enabling this unfortunate creature to render important
      and mysterious services to the people who held her fate in their hands,
      forced her to infamous treachery. Unfortunately, all things favored this
      machination. We know that Florine, in her interview with Mother Bunch, a
      few days after Mdlle. de Cardoville was imprisoned at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s,
      had yielded to a twinge of remorse, and given to the sempstress advice
      likely to be of use to Adrienne&rsquo;s interests&mdash;sending word to
      Agricola not to deliver to Madame de Saint Dizier the papers found in the
      hiding-place of the pavilion, but only to entrust them to Mdlle. de
      Cardoville herself. The latter, afterwards informed of these details by
      Mother Bunch, felt a double degree of confidence and interest in Florine,
      took her back into her service with gratitude, and almost immediately
      charged her with a confidential mission&mdash;that of superintending the
      arrangements of the house hired for Djalma&rsquo;s habitation. As for
      Mother Bunch (yielding to the solicitations of Mdlle. de Cardoville, and
      finding she was no longer of use to Dagobert&rsquo;s wife, of whom we
      shall speak hereafter), she had consented to take up her abode in the
      hotel on the Rue d&rsquo;Anjou, along with Adrienne, who with that rare
      sagacity of the heart peculiar to her, entrusted the young sempstress, who
      served her also as a secretary, with the department of alms-giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had at first thought of entertaining her merely as a
      friend, wishing to pay homage in her person to probity with labor,
      resignation in sorrow, and intelligence in poverty; but knowing the
      workgirl&rsquo;s natural dignity, she feared, with reason that,
      notwithstanding the delicate circumspection with which the hospitality
      would be offered, Mother Bunch might perceive in it alms in disguise.
      Adrienne preferred, therefore, whilst she treated her as a friend, to give
      her a confidential employment. In this manner the great delicacy of the
      needlewoman would be spared, since she could earn her livelihood by
      performing duties which would at the same time satisfy her praiseworthy
      instincts of charity. In fact, she could fulfil, better than any one, the
      sacred mission confided to her by Adrienne. Her cruel experience in
      misfortune, the goodness of her angelic soul, the elevation of her mind,
      her rare activity, her penetration with regard to the painful secrets of
      poverty, her perfect knowledge of the industrial classes, were sufficient
      security for the tact and intelligence with which the excellent creature
      would second the generous intentions of Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now speak of the divers events which, on that day, preceded the
      coming of Mdlle. de Cardoville to the garden-gate of the house in the Rue
      Blanche. About ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the blinds of Adrienne&rsquo;s
      bedchamber, closely shut, admitted no ray of daylight to this apartment,
      which was only lighted by a spherical lamp of oriental alabaster,
      suspended from the ceiling by three long silver chains. This apartment,
      terminating in a dome, was in the form of a tent with eight sides. From
      the ceiling to the floor, it was hung with white silk, covered with long
      draperies of muslin, fastened in large puffs to the wall, by bands caught
      in at regular distances by plates of ivory. Two doors, also of ivory,
      admirably encrusted with mother-of-pearl, led, one to the bath-room, the
      other to the toilet-chamber, a sort of little temple dedicated to the
      worship of beauty, and furnished as it had been at the pavilion of Saint
      Dizier House. Two other compartments of the wall were occupied by windows,
      completely veiled with drapery. Opposite the bed, enclosing splendid
      fire-dogs of chased silver, was a chimney-piece of white marble, like
      crystallized snow, on which were sculptured two magnificent caryatides,
      and a frieze representing birds and flowers. Above this frieze, carved in
      openwork with extreme delicacy, was a marble basket, filled with red
      camellias. Their leaves of shining green their flowers of a delicate rosy
      hue, were the only colors that disturbed the harmonious whiteness of this
      virgin retreat. Finally, half surrounded by waves of white muslin, which
      poured down from the dome like a mass of light clouds, the bed was visible&mdash;very
      low, and resting on feet of carved ivory, which stood upon the ermine
      carpet that covered the floor. With the exception of a plinth, also in
      ivory, admirably inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the bed was entirely covered
      with white satin, wadded and quilted like an immense scent-bag. The
      cambric sheets, trimmed with lace, being a little disturbed on one side,
      discovered the corner of a white taffety mattress, and a light counterpane
      of watered stuff&mdash;for an equal temperature always reigned in this
      apartment, warm as a fine spring day.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a singular scruple, arising from the same sentiment which had caused
      Adrienne to have inscribed on a masterpiece of goldsmith&rsquo;s work the
      name of the maker instead of that of the seller, she had wished all these
      articles, so costly and sumptuous, to be manufactured by workmen chosen
      amongst the most intelligent, honest, and industrious of their class, whom
      she had supplied with the necessary materials. In this manner she had been
      able to add to the price of the work the profit usually gained by the
      middle man, who speculates in such labor; this notable augmentation of
      wages had spread happiness and comfort through a hundred necessitous
      families, who, blessing the munificence of Adrienne, gave her, as she
      said, the right to enjoy her luxury as a good action. Nothing could be
      fresher or more charming than the interior of this bedchamber. Mdlle. de
      Cardoville had just awoke; she reposed in the middle of this flood of
      muslin, lace, cambric, and white silk, in a position full of sweet grace.
      Never during the night did she cover that beautiful golden hair (a certain
      recipe, said the Greeks, for preserving it for a long while in
      magnificence). Every evening, her women arranged her long silky curls in
      flat tresses, forming two broad bands, which, descending sufficiently low
      almost entirely to conceal the small ear, the rosy lobe of which was alone
      visible, were joined to the large plait behind the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      This head-dress, borrowed from Greek antiquity, set off to admiration the
      pure, fine features of Mdlle. de Cardoville, and made her look so much
      younger, that, instead of eighteen, one would hardly have given her
      fifteen years of age. Gathered thus closely about the temples, the hair
      lost its transparent and brilliant hues, and would have appeared almost
      brown, but for the golden tints which played here and there, amid the
      undulations of the tresses. Lulled in that morning torpor, the warm
      languor of which is so favorable to soft reveries, Adrienne leaned with
      her elbow on the pillow, and her head a little on one side, which
      displayed to advantage the ideal contour of her bared neck and shoulders;
      her smiling lips, moist and rosy, were, like her cheeks, cold as if they
      had just been bathed in ice-water; her snow-white lids half veiled the
      large, dark, soft eyes, which now gazed languidly upon vacancy, and now
      fixed themselves with pleasure upon the rosy flowers and green leaves in
      the basket of camellias. Who can paint the matchless serenity of Adrienne&rsquo;s
      awaking&mdash;when the fair and chaste soul roused itself in the fair and
      chaste body? It was the awakening of a heart as pure as the fresh and
      balmy breath of youth, that made her bosom rise and fall in its white,
      immaculate purity. What creed, what dogma, what formula, what religious
      symbol, oh! paternal and divine Creator! can ever give a more complete
      idea of Thy harmonious and ineffable power, than the image of a young
      maiden awaking in the bloom of her beauty, and in all the grace of that
      modesty with which Thou hast endowed her, seeking, in her dreamy
      innocence, for the secret of that celestial instinct of love, which Thou
      hast placed in the bosom of all Thy creatures&mdash;oh! Thou whose love is
      eternal, and goodness infinite!
    </p>
    <p>
      The confused thoughts which, since her sleep, had appeared gently to
      agitate Adrienne, absorbed her more and more; her head resting on her
      bosom, her beautiful arm upon the couch, her features without becoming
      precisely sad, assumed an expression of touching melancholy. Her dearest
      desire was accomplished; she was about to live independent and alone. But
      this affectionate, delicate, expansive, and marvellously complete nature,
      felt that God had not given her such rare treasures, to bury them in a
      cold and selfish solitude. She felt how much that was great and beautiful
      might be inspired by love, both in herself, and in him that should be
      worthy of her. Confiding in her courage, and the nobleness of her
      character, proud of the example that she wished to give to other women,
      knowing that all eyes would be fixed enviously upon her, she felt, as it
      were, only too sure of herself; far from fearing that she should make a
      bad choice, she rather feared, that she should not find any from whom to
      choose, so pure and perfect was her taste. And, even had she met with her
      own ideal, she had views so singular and so just, so extraordinary and yet
      so sensible, with regard to the independence and dignity of woman, that,
      inexorably determined to make no concession upon this head, she asked
      herself if the man of her choice would ever accept the hitherto unheard-of
      conditions that she meant to impose. In recalling to her remembrance the
      possible suitors that she had met in the world, she remembered also the
      dark, but true picture, which Rodin had drawn with so much caustic
      bitterness. She remembered, too, not without a certain pride, the
      encouragement this man had given her, not by flattery, but by advising her
      to follow out and accomplish a great, generous, and beautiful design. The
      current or the caprice of fancy soon brought Adrienne to think of Djalma.
      Whilst she congratulated herself on having paid to her royal kinsman the
      duties of a kingly hospitality, the young lady was far from regarding the
      prince as the hero of her future.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first she said to herself, not unreasonably, that this half-savage
      boy, with passions, if not untamable, yet untamed, transported on a sudden
      into the midst of a refined civilization, would be inevitably destined to
      fiery trials and violent transformations. Now Mdlle. de Cardoville, having
      nothing masculine or despotic in her character, had no wish to civilize
      the young savage. Therefore, notwithstanding the interest, or rather
      because of the interest, which she felt for the young Indian, she was
      firmly resolved, not to make herself known to him, till after the lapse of
      two or three months; and she determined also, that, even if Djalma should
      learn by chance that she was his relation, she would not receive his
      visit. She desired, if not to try him, at least to leave him free in all
      his acts, so that he might expend the first fire of his passions, good or
      bad. But not wishing to abandon him quite without defence to the perils of
      Parisian life, she requested the Count de Montbron, in confidence, to
      introduce Prince Djalma to the best company in Paris, and to enlighten him
      by the counsels of his long experience. M. de Montbron had received the
      request of Mdlle. de Cardoville with the greatest pleasure, taking
      delight, he said, in starting his royal tiger in drawing-rooms, and
      bringing him into contact with the flower of the fine ladies and gentlemen
      of Paris, offering at the same time to wager any amount in favor of his
      half-savage pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for myself, my dear Count,&rdquo; said Adrienne to M. de
      Montbron, with her usual frankness, &ldquo;my resolution is not to be
      shaken. You have told me the effect that will be produced in the
      fashionable world, by the first appearance of Prince Djalma, an Indian
      nineteen years of age, of surprising beauty, proud and wild as a young
      lion arriving from his forest; it is new, it is extraordinary, you added;
      and, therefore, all the coquetries of civilized life will pursue him with
      an eagerness which makes me tremble for him. Now, seriously, my dear count
      it will not suit me to appear as the rival of so many fine ladies, who are
      about to expose themselves intrepidly to the claws of the young tiger. I
      take great interest in him, because he is my cousin, because he is
      handsome, because he is brave, and above all because he does not wear that
      horrible European dress. No doubt these are rare qualities&mdash;but not
      sufficient to make me change my mind. Besides, the good old philosopher,
      my new friend, has given me advice about this Indian, which you, my dear
      Count, who are not a philosopher, will yet approve. It is, for some time,
      to receive visits at home, but not to visit other people&mdash;which will
      spare me the awkwardness of meeting my royal cousin, and allow me to make
      a careful choice, even amongst my usual society. As my house will be an
      excellent one, my position most unusual, and as I shall be suspected of
      all sorts of naughty secrets, I shall be in no want of inquisitive
      visitors, who will amuse me a good deal, I assure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as M. de Montbron asked, if the exile of the poor young Indian tiger
      was to last long, Adrienne answered: &ldquo;As I shall see most of the
      persons, to whom you will introduce him, I shall be pleased to hear
      different opinions about him. If certain men speak well of him, and
      certain women ill, I shall have good hope of him. In a word, the opinion
      that I come to, in sifting the true from the false (you may leave that to
      my sagacity), will shorten or prolong the exile of my royal cousin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the formal intentions of Mdlle. de Cardoville with regard to
      Djalma, even on the day she went with Florine to the house he occupied. In
      a word, she had positively resolved not to be known to him for some months
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long reflecting that morning, on the chances that might yet offer
      themselves to satisfy the wants of her heart, Adrienne fell into a new,
      deep reverie. This charming creature, so full of life and youth, heaved a
      low sigh, raised her arms above her head, turned her profile towards the
      pillow, and remained for some moments as if powerless and vanquished.
      Motionless beneath the white tissues that wrapped her round, she looked
      like a fair, marble statue, visible beneath a light layer of snow.
      Suddenly, Adrienne raised herself up, drew her hand across her brow, and
      rang for her women. At the first silver tone of the bell, the two ivory
      doors opened. Georgette appeared on the threshold of the dressing-room,
      from which Frisky, a little black and-tan dog, with his golden collar,
      escaped with a joyful barking. Hebe appeared at the same time on the
      threshold of the bath-room. At the further end of this apartment, lighted
      from above, might be seen upon a green mat of Spanish leather, with golden
      ornaments, a crystal bath in the form of a long shell. The three only
      divisions in this masterpiece of glass work, were concealed by the elegant
      device of several large reeds in silver, which rose from the wide base of
      the bath, also of wrought silver, representing children and dolphins
      playing, among branches of natural coral, and azure shells. Nothing could
      be more pleasing than the effect of these purple reeds and ultramarine
      shells, upon a dull ground of silver; the balsamic vapor, which rose from
      the warm, limpid, and perfumed water, that filled the crystal shell,
      spread through the bath-room, and floated like a light cloud into the
      sleeping-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Hebe in her fresh and pretty costume, bringing her a long bathing
      gown, hanging upon a bare and dimpled arm, Adrienne said to her: &ldquo;Where
      is Florine, my child?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, she went downstairs two hours ago; she was wanted for
      something very pressing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wanted her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young person who serves Madame as secretary. She went out this
      morning very early; and, as soon as she returned, she sent for Florine,
      who has not come back since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This absence no doubt relates to some important affair of my
      angelic minister of succor,&rdquo; said Adrienne, smiling, and thinking of
      the hunchback. Then she made a sign to Hebe to approach her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two hours after rising, Adrienne, having had herself dressed, as
      usual, with rare elegance, dismissed her women, and sent for Mother Bunch,
      whom she treated with marked deference, always receiving her alone. The
      young sempstress entered hastily, with a pale, agitated countenance, and
      said, in a trembling voice: &ldquo;Oh, madame! my presentiments were
      justified. You are betrayed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what presentiments do you speak, my dear child!&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, with surprise. &ldquo;Who betrays me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin!&rdquo; answered the workgirl.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. DOUBTS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n hearing the
      accusation brought against Rodin, Mdlle. de Cardoville looked at the
      denunciator with new astonishment. Before continuing this scene, we may
      say that Mother Bunch was no longer clad in her poor, old clothes, but was
      dressed in black, with as much simplicity as taste. The sad color seemed
      to indicate her renunciation of all human vanity, the eternal mourning of
      her heart, and the austere duties imposed upon her by her devotion to
      misfortune. With her black gown, she wore a large falling collar, white
      and neat as her little gauze cap, with its gray ribbons, which, revealing
      her bands of fine brown hair, set off to advantage her pale and melancholy
      countenance, with its soft blue eyes. Her long, delicate hands, preserved
      from the cold by gloves, were no longer, as formerly, of a violet hue, but
      of an almost transparent whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her agitated features expressed a lively uneasiness. Extremely surprised,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville exclaimed: &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin betrays you, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin? Impossible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! my presentiments did not deceive me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your presentiments?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time I saw M. Rodin, I was frightened in spite of myself.
      My heart sank within me, and I trembled&mdash;for you, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; said Adrienne. &ldquo;Why did you not tremble for
      yourself, my poor friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, madame; but such was my first impression. And this
      fear was so invincible, that, notwithstanding the kindness that M. Rodin
      showed my sister, he frightened me, none the less.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange. I can understand as well as any one the almost
      irresistible influence of sympathies or aversions; but, in this instance&mdash;However,&rdquo;
      resumed Adrienne, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;no matter for
      that; how have these suspicions been changed to certainty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, I went to take to my sister Cephyse, the assistance that
      M. Rodin had given me, in the name of a charitable person. I did not find
      Cephyse at the friend&rsquo;s who had taken care of her; I therefore
      begged the portress, to inform my sister that I would call again this
      morning. That is what I did; but you must excuse me, madame, some
      necessary details.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young girl who had received my sister,&rdquo; said Mother
      Bunch, with embarrassment, casting down her eyes and blushing, &ldquo;does
      not lead a very regular life. A person, with whom she has gone on several
      parties of pleasure, one M. Dumoulin, had informed her of the real name of
      M. Rodin, who has a kind of lodging in that house, and there goes by the
      name of Charlemagne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what he told us at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s; and, the day
      before yesterday, when I again alluded to the circumstance, he explained
      to me the necessity in which he was, for certain reasons, to have a humble
      retreat in that remote quarter&mdash;and I could not but approve of his
      motives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! yesterday, M. Rodin received a visit from the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny!&rdquo; exclaimed Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; he remained for two hours shut up with M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, you must have been deceived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told, madame, that the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny had called in
      the morning to see M. Rodin; not finding him at home, he had left with the
      portress his name written on a slip of paper, with the words, &lsquo;I
      shall return in two hours.&rsquo; The girl of whom I spoke, madame, had
      seen this slip of paper. As all that concerns M. Rodin appears mysterious
      enough, she had the curiosity to wait for M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny in the
      porter&rsquo;s lodge, and, about two hours afterwards, he indeed returned,
      and saw M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Adrienne, shuddering; &ldquo;it is impossible.
      There must be some mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, madame; for, knowing how serious such a discovery
      would be, I begged the young girl to describe to me the appearance of M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, she told me, is about forty years of
      age. He is tall and upright, dresses plainly, but with care; has gray
      eyes, very large and piercing, thick eyebrows, chestnut-colored hair, a
      face closely shaved, and a very decided aspect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Adrienne, hardly able to believe what she
      heard. &ldquo;The description is exact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wishing to have all possible details,&rdquo; resumed Mother Bunch,
      &ldquo;I asked the portress if M. Rodin and the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      appeared to be at variance when they quitted the house? She replied no,
      but that the Abbe said to M. Rodin, as they parted at the door: &lsquo;I
      will write to you tomorrow, as agreed.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a dream? Good heaven!&rdquo; said Adrienne, drawing her hands
      across her forehead in a sort of stupor. &ldquo;I cannot doubt your word,
      my poor friend; and yet it is M. Rodin who himself sent you to that house,
      to give assistance to your sister: would he have wilfully laid open to you
      his secret interviews with the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny? It would have been
      bad policy in a traitor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, and the same reflection occurred to me. And yet the
      meeting of these two men appeared so dangerous to you, madame, that I
      returned home full of terror.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters of extreme honesty are very hard to convince of the treachery
      of others: the more infamous the deception, the more they are inclined to
      doubt it. Adrienne was one of these characters, rectitude being a prime
      quality of her mind. Though deeply impressed by the communication, she
      remarked: &ldquo;Come, my dear, do not let us frighten ourselves too soon,
      or be over-hasty in believing evil. Let us try to enlighten ourselves by
      reasoning, and first of all remember facts. M. Rodin opened for me the
      doors of Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s asylum; in my presence, he brought, his
      charge against the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny; he forced the superior of the
      convent to restore Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters, he succeeded in
      discovering the retreat of Prince Djalma&mdash;he faithfully executed my
      intentions with regard to my young cousin; only yesterday, he gave me the
      most useful advice. All this is true&mdash;is it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now suppose that M. Rodin, putting things in their worst light, had
      some after-thought&mdash;that he hopes to be liberally rewarded, for
      instance; hitherto, at least, he has shown complete disinterestedness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also is true, madame,&rdquo; said poor Mother Bunch, obliged,
      like Adrienne, to admit the evidence of fixed facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us look to the possibility of treachery. Unite with the
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny to betray me! Betray me?&mdash;how? and for what
      purpose? What have I to fear? Is it not the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, on the
      contrary, is it not Madame de Saint-Dizier, who have to render an account
      for the injuries they have done me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, then, madame, how do you explain the meeting of these two men,
      who have so many motives for mutual aversion? May there not be some dark
      project still behind? Besides, madame, I am not the only one to think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, on my return, I was so much agitated, that Mdlle.
      Florine asked me the cause of my trouble. I know, madame, how much she is
      devoted to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody could be more so; only recently, you yourself informed me of
      the signal service she rendered, during my confinement at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame, this morning, on my return, thinking it necessary to
      have you informed as soon as possible, I told all to Mdlle. Florine. Like
      me&mdash;even more, perhaps&mdash;she was terrified at the meeting of
      Rodin and M. d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, she said to me: &lsquo;It is, I
      think, useless to disturb my mistress at present; it can be of no
      importance whether she is informed of this treachery two or three hours
      sooner or later; during that time I may be able to discover something
      more. I have an idea, which I think a good one. Make my excuses to my
      mistress; I shall soon be back.&rsquo; Then Florine sent for a
      hackney-coach, and went out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine is an excellent girl,&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      with a smile, for further reflection had quite reassured her: &ldquo;but,
      on this occasion, I think that her zeal and good heart have deceived her,
      as they have you, my poor friend. Do you know, that we are two madcaps,
      you and I, not to have thought of one thing, which would have put us quite
      at our ease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny fears M. Rodin; he may have sought him
      out, to entreat his forbearance. Do you not find this explanation both
      satisfactory and reasonable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so, madame,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection; &ldquo;yes, it is probable.&rdquo; But after another silence,
      and as if yielding to a conviction superior to every possible argument,
      she exclaimed: &ldquo;And yet, no; believe me, madame, you are deceived. I
      feel it. All appearances may be against what I affirm; yet, believe me,
      these presentiments are too strong not to be true. And have you not
      guessed the most secret instincts of my heart? Why should I not be able to
      guess the dangers with which you are menaced?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say? what have I guessed?&rdquo; replied Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, involuntarily impressed by the other&rsquo;s tone of
      conviction and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you guessed?&rdquo; resumed the latter. &ldquo;All the
      troublesome susceptibility of an unfortunate creature, to whom destiny has
      decreed a life apart. If I have hitherto been silent, it is not from
      ignorance of what I owe you. Who told you, madame, that the only way to
      make me accept your favors without blushing, was to give me some
      employment, that would enable me to soothe the misfortunes I had so long
      shared? Who told you, when you wished me to have a seat at your table, and
      to treat as your friend the poor needlewoman, in whose person you sought
      to honor, resignation and honest industry&mdash;who told you, when I
      answered with tears of gratitude and regret, that it was not false
      modesty, but a consciousness of my own ridiculous deformity, that made me
      refuse your offer? Who told you that, but for this, I should have accepted
      it proudly, in the name of all my low-born sisters? But you replied to me
      with the touching words: &lsquo;I understand your refusal, my friend; it
      is not occasioned by false modesty, but by a sentiment of dignity that I
      love and respect.&rsquo; Who told you,&rdquo; continued the workgirl, with
      increasing animation, &ldquo;that I should be so happy to find a little
      solitary retreat in this magnificent house, which dazzles me with its
      splendor? Who guided you in the choice of the apartment (still far too
      good) that you have provided for me? Who taught you, that, without envying
      the beauty of the charming creatures that surround you, and whom I love
      because they love you, I should always feel, by an involuntary comparison,
      embarrassed and ashamed before them? Who told you therefore to send them
      away, whenever you wished to speak with me? Yes! who has revealed to you
      all the painful and secret susceptibilities of a position like mine! Who
      has revealed them to you? God, no doubt! who in His infinite majesty
      creates worlds, and yet cares for the poor little insect hidden beneath
      the grass. And you think, that the gratitude of a heart you have
      understood so well, cannot rise in its turn to the knowledge of what may
      be hurtful to you? No, no, lady; some people have the instinct of self
      preservation; others have the still more precious instinct that enables
      them to preserve those they love. God has given me this instinct. I tell
      you that you are betrayed!&rdquo; And with animated look, and cheeks
      slightly colored with emotion, the speaker laid such stress upon the last
      words, and accompanied them with such energetic gesture, that Mdlle. de
      Cardoville already shaken by the girl&rsquo;s warmth, began almost to
      share in her apprehensions. Then, although she had before learned to
      appreciate the superior intelligence of this poor child of the people,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had never till now heard her friend express herself
      with so much eloquence&mdash;an eloquence, too, that was inspired by the
      noblest sentiments. This circumstance added to the impression made upon
      Adrienne. But at the moment she was about to answer, a knock was heard at
      the door of the room, and Florine entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing the alarmed countenance of her waiting-maid, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville said hastily: &ldquo;Well, Florine! what news? Whence come you,
      my child?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20405.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Saint-Dizier House, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you go there?&rdquo; asked Mdlle. de Cardoville, with
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; said Florine, glancing at the workgirl,
      &ldquo;madame, there, confided to me her suspicions and uneasiness. I
      shared in them. The visit of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny to M. Rodin
      appeared to me very serious. I thought, if it should turn out that M.
      Rodin had been during the last few days to Saint-Dizier House, there would
      be no longer any doubt of his treachery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Adrienne, more and more uneasy. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I had been charged to superintend the removal from the lodge, I
      knew that several things had remained there. To obtain admittance, I had
      to apply to Mrs. Grivois. I had thus a pretext for returning to the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next, Florine, what next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I endeavored to get Mrs. Grivois to talk of M. Rodin; but it was in
      vain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She suspected you,&rdquo; said the workgirl. &ldquo;It was to be
      anticipated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked her,&rdquo; continued Florine, &ldquo;if they had seen M.
      Rodin at the hotel lately. She answered evasively. Then despairing of
      getting anything out of her,&rdquo; continued Florine, &ldquo;I left Mrs.
      Grivois, and that my visit might excite no suspicion, I went to the
      pavilion&mdash;when, as I turn down the avenue&mdash;whom do I see? why,
      M. Rodin himself, hastening towards the little garden-door, wishing no
      doubt to depart unnoticed by that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, you hear,&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, clasping her hands
      with a supplicating air; &ldquo;such evidence should convince you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin at the Princess de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s!&rdquo; cried
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, whose glance, generally so mild, now suddenly
      flashed with vehement indignation. Then she added, in a tone of
      considerable emotion, &ldquo;Continue, Florine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At sight of M. Rodin, I stopped,&rdquo; proceeded Florine, &ldquo;and
      keeping a little on one side, I gained the pavilion without being seen. I
      looked out into the street, through the closed blinds, and perceived a
      hackney coach. It was waiting for M. Rodin, for, a minute after, he got
      into it, saying to the coachman, &lsquo;No. 39, Rue Blanche.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince&rsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M. Rodin was to see him to-day,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he betrays you, madame, and the prince also; the latter
      will be made his victim more easily than you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame! shame!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, on a sudden, as
      she rose, all her features contracted with painful anger. &ldquo;After
      such a piece of treachery, it is enough to make us doubt of everything&mdash;even
      of ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame! is it not dreadful?&rdquo; said Mother Bunch,
      shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, then, why did he rescue me and mine, and accuse the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny?&rdquo;
      wondered Mdlle. de Cardoville. &ldquo;Of a truth, it is enough to make one
      lose one&rsquo;s reason. It is an abyss&mdash;but, oh! how frightful is
      doubt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I returned,&rdquo; said Florine, casting a look of affectionate
      devotion on her mistress, &ldquo;I thought of a way to make all clear; but
      there is not a minute to lose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Adrienne, looking at Florine with
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin will soon be alone with the prince,&rdquo; said Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; replied Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince always sits in a little room that opens upon a
      greenhouse. It is there that he will receive M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; resumed Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This greenhouse, which I had arranged according to your orders, has
      only one issue&mdash;by a door leading into a little lane. The gardener
      gets in that way every morning, so as not to have to pass through the
      apartments. Having finished his work, he does not return thither during
      the day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? what is your project?&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      looking at Florine with growing surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plants are so disposed, that, I think, if even the shade were
      not there, which screens the glass that separates the saloon from the
      greenhouse, one might get near enough to hear what was passing in the
      room, without being seen. When I was superintending the arrangements, I
      always entered by this greenhouse door. The gardener had one key, and I
      another. Luckily, I have not yet parted with mine. Within an hour, you may
      know how far to trust M. Rodin. If he betrays the prince, he betrays you
      also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you?&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set out instantly with me; we reach the side door; I enter alone,
      for precaution sake&mdash;if all is right, I return&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have me turn spy?&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      haughtily, interrupting Florine. &ldquo;You cannot think it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame,&rdquo; said the girl, casting down her
      eyes, with confused and sorrowful air; &ldquo;you had suspicions, and me
      seems &lsquo;tis the only way to confirm or destroy them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoop to listen to a conversation&mdash;never!&rdquo; replied
      Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, suddenly, after same moments&rsquo;
      thought, &ldquo;permit me to tell you that Mdlle. Florine is right. The
      plan proposed is a painful one, but it is the only way in which you can
      clear up, perhaps, for ever, your doubts as to M. Rodin. Notwithstanding
      the evidence of facts, in spite of the almost certainty of my
      presentiments, appearances may deceive us. I was the first who accused M.
      Rodin to you. I should not forgive myself all the rest of my life, did I
      accuse him wrongfully. Beyond doubt, it is painful, as you say, madame, to
      listen to a conversation&mdash;&rdquo; Then, with a violent effort to
      console herself, she added, as she strove to repress her tears, &ldquo;Yet,
      as your safety is at stake, madame&mdash;for, if this be treachery, the
      future prospect is dreadful&mdash;I will go in your place&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word more, I entreat you,&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      interrupting. &ldquo;Let you, my poor friend, do for me what I thought
      degrading to do myself? Never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Florine, she added, &ldquo;Tell M. de Bonneville to have
      the carriage got ready on the instant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consent, then!&rdquo; cried Florine, clasping her hands, and
      not seeking to conceal her joy; and her eyes also became full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I consent,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, with emotion. &ldquo;If
      it is to be war&mdash;war to the knife, that they would wage with me&mdash;I
      must be prepared for it; and, come to think of it, it would only be
      weakness and folly not to put myself on my guard. No doubt this step costs
      me much, and is very repugnant to me, but it is the only way to put an end
      to suspicions that would be a continual torment to me, and perhaps to
      prevent still greater evils. Yes! for many important reasons, this
      interview of M. Rodin with Prince Djalma may be doubly decisive to me&mdash;as
      to the confidence, or the inexorable hate, that I must henceforth feel for
      M. Rodin. So, Florine, quick!&mdash;my cloak and bonnet, and the carriage.
      You will go with me. As for you, my dear, pray wait for me here,&rdquo;
      she added, turning to the work girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour after this conversation, Adrienne&rsquo;s carriage stopped,
      as we have before seen, at the little garden-gate of the house in the Rue
      Blanche. Florine entered the greenhouse and soon returned to her mistress.
      &ldquo;The shade is down, madame. M. Rodin has just entered the prince&rsquo;s
      room.&rdquo; Mdlle. de Cardoville was, therefore, present, though
      invisible, at the following scene, which took place between Rodin and
      Djalma.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. THE LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome minutes before
      the entrance of Mdlle. de Cardoville into the greenhouse, Rodin had been
      introduced by Faringhea into the presence of the prince, who, still under
      the influence of the burning excitement into which he had been plunged by
      the words of the half-caste, did not appear to perceive the Jesuit. The
      latter, surprised at the animated expression of Djalma&rsquo;s
      countenance, and his almost frantic air, made a sign of interrogation to
      Faringhea, who answered him privately in the following symbolical manner:&mdash;After
      laying his forefinger on his head and heart, he pointed to the fire
      burning in the chimney, signifying by his pantomimic action that the head
      and heart of Djalma were both in flames. No doubt Rodin understood him,
      for an imperceptible smile of satisfaction played upon his wan lips; then
      he said aloud to Faringhea, &ldquo;I wish to be alone with the prince. Let
      down the shade and see that we are not interrupted.&rdquo; The half-caste
      bowed, and touched a spring near the sheet of plate-glass, which slid into
      the wall as the blind descended; then, again bowing, Faringhea left the
      room. It was shortly after that Mdlle. de Cardoville and Florine entered
      the greenhouse, which was now only separated from the room in which was
      Djalma, by the transparent thickness of a shade of white silk, embroidered
      with large colored birds. The noise of the door, which Faringhea closed as
      he went out, seemed to recall the young Indian to himself; his features,
      though still animated, recovered their habitual expression of mildness and
      gentleness; he started, drew his hand across his brow, looked around him,
      as if waking up from a deep reverie, and then, advancing towards Rodin,
      with an air as respectful as confused, he said to him, using the
      expression commonly applied to old men in his country, &ldquo;Pardon me,
      father.&rdquo; Still following the customs of his nation, so full of
      deference towards age, he took Rodin&rsquo;s hand to raise it to his lips,
      but the Jesuit drew back a step, and refused his homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what do you ask pardon, my dear prince?&rdquo; said he to
      Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you entered, I was in a dream; I did not come to meet you.
      Once more, pardon me, father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, I forgive you with all my heart, my dear prince. But let
      us have some talk. Pray resume your place on the couch, and your pipe,
      too, if you like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Djalma, instead of adopting the suggestion, and throwing himself on
      the divan, according to his custom, insisted on seating himself in a
      chair, notwithstanding all the persuasions of &ldquo;the Old Man with the
      Good Heart,&rdquo; as he always called the Jesuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, your politeness troubles me, my dear prince,&rdquo; said
      Rodin; &ldquo;you are here at home in India; at least, we wish you to
      think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many things remind me of my country,&rdquo; said Djalma, in a mild
      grave tone. &ldquo;Your goodness reminds me of my father, and of him who
      was a father to me,&rdquo; added the Indian, as he thought of Marshal
      Simon, whose arrival in Paris had been purposely concealed from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, he resumed in a tone full of affectionate
      warmth, as he stretched out his hand to Rodin, &ldquo;You are come, and I
      am happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your joy, my dear prince, for I come to take you out
      of prison&mdash;to open your cage for you. I had begged you to submit to a
      brief seclusion, entirely for your own interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I go out to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, my dear prince, if you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Indian reflected for a moment, and then resumed, &ldquo;I must
      have friends, since I am here in a palace that does not belong to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you have friends&mdash;excellent friends,&rdquo; answered
      Rodin. At these words, Djalma&rsquo;s countenance seemed to acquire fresh
      beauty. The most noble sentiments were expressed in his fine features; his
      large black eyes became slightly humid, and, after another interval of
      silence, he rose and said to Rodin with emotion: &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither, dear prince?&rdquo; said the other, much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To thank my friends. I have waited three days. It is long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me dear prince&mdash;I have much to tell you on this subject&mdash;please
      to be seated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma resumed his seat with docility. Rodin continued: &ldquo;It is true
      that you have friends; or rather, you have a friend. Friends are rare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you have two friends, my dear prince&mdash;myself, whom
      you know, and one other, whom you do not know, and who desires to remain
      unknown to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; answered Rodin, after a moment&rsquo;s embarrassment.
      &ldquo;Because the happiness he feels in giving you these proofs of his
      friendship and even his own tranquillity, depend upon preserving this
      mystery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should there be concealment when we do good?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, to conceal the good we do, my dear prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I profit by this friendship; why should he conceal himself from
      one?&rdquo; These repeated questions of the young Indian appeared to
      puzzle Rodin, who, however, replied: &ldquo;I have told you, my dear
      prince, that your secret friend would perhaps have his tranquillity
      compromised, if he were known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were known&mdash;as my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so, dear prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of Djalma immediately assumed an appearance of sorrowful
      dignity; he raised his head proudly, and said in a stern and haughty
      voice: &ldquo;Since this friend hides himself from me, he must either be
      ashamed of me, or there is reason for me to be ashamed of him. I only
      accept hospitality from those who are worthy of me, and who think me
      worthy of them. I leave this house.&rdquo; So saying, Djalma rose with
      such an air of determination, that Rodin exclaimed: &ldquo;Listen to me,
      my dear prince. Allow me to tell you, that your petulance and touchiness
      are almost incredible. Though we have endeavored to remind you of your
      beautiful country, we are here in Europe, in France, in the centre of
      Paris. This consideration may perhaps a little modify your views. Listen
      to me, I conjure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his complete ignorance of certain social conventionalisms,
      Djalma had too much good sense and uprightness, not to appreciate reason,
      when it appeared reasonable. The words of Rodin calmed him. With that
      ingenuous modesty, with which natures full of strength and generosity are
      almost always endowed, he answered mildly: &ldquo;You are right, father. I
      am no longer in my own country. Here the customs are different. I will
      reflect upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his craft and suppleness, Rodin sometimes found himself
      perplexed by the wild and unforseen ideas of the young Indian. Thus he
      saw, to his great surprise, that Djalma now remained pensive for some
      minutes, after which he resumed in a calm but firm tone: &ldquo;I have
      obeyed you, father: I have reflected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear prince?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In no country in the world, under no pretext, should a man of honor
      conceal his friendship for another man of honor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose there should be danger in avowing this friendship?&rdquo;
      said Rodin, very uneasy at the turn the conversation was taking. Djalma
      eyed the Jesuit with contemptuous astonishment, and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your silence, my dear prince: a brave man ought to
      defy danger. True; but if it should be you that the danger threatens, in
      case this friendship were discovered, would not your man of honor be
      excusable, even praiseworthy, to persist in remaining unknown?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept nothing from a friend, who thinks me capable of denying
      him from cowardice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear prince&mdash;listen to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet reflect!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said it,&rdquo; replied Djalma, in an abrupt and almost
      sovereign tone, as he walked towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose a woman were concerned,&rdquo; cried Rodin, driven to
      extremity, and hastening after the young Indian, for he really feared that
      Djalma might rush from the house, and thus overthrow all his projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last words of Rodin the Indian stopped abruptly. &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo;
      said he, with a start, and turning red. &ldquo;A woman is concerned?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes! suppose it were a woman,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;would
      you not then understand her reserve, and the secrecy with which she is
      obliged to surround the marks of affection she wishes to give you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; repeated Djalma, in a trembling voice, clasping his
      hands in adoration; and his beautiful countenance was expressive of the
      deepest emotion. &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; said he again. &ldquo;A Parisian?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear prince, as you force me to this indiscretion, I will
      confess to you that your friend is a real Parisian&mdash;a noble matron,
      endowed with the highest virtues&mdash;whose age alone merits all your
      respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very old, then?&rdquo; cried poor Djalma, whose charming
      dream was thus abruptly dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be a few years older than I am,&rdquo; answered Rodin, with
      an ironical smile, expecting to see the young man express a sort of
      comical disappointment or angry regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not so. To the passionate enthusiasm of love, which had for a
      moment lighted up the prince&rsquo;s features, there now succeeded a
      respectful and touching expression. He looked at Rodin with emotion, and
      said to him in a broken voice: &ldquo;This woman, is then, a mother to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe with what a pious, melancholy, and tender
      charm the Indian uttered the word mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have it, my dear prince; this respectable lady wishes to be a
      mother to you. But I may not reveal to you the cause of the affection she
      feels for you. Only, believe me&mdash;this affection is sincere, and the
      cause honorable. If I do not tell you her secret, it is that, with us, the
      secrets of women, young or old, are equally sacred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right, and I will respect it. Without seeing her, I will
      love her&mdash;as I love God, without seeing Him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear prince, let me tell you what are the intentions of
      your maternal friend. This house will remain at your disposal, as long as
      you like it; French servants, a carriage, and horses, will be at your
      orders; the charges of your housekeeping will be paid for you. Then, as
      the son of a king should live royalty, I have left in the next room a
      casket containing five hundred Louis; every month a similar sum will be
      provided: if it should not be found sufficient for your little amusements,
      you will tell me, and it shall be augmented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a movement of Djalma, Rodin hastened to add: &ldquo;I must tell you at
      once, my dear prince, that your delicacy may be quite at ease. First of
      all, you may accept anything from a mother; next, as in about three months
      you will come into possession of an immense inheritance, it will be easy
      for you, if you feel the obligation a burden&mdash;and the sum cannot
      exceed, at the most, four or five thousand Louis&mdash;to repay these
      advances. Spare nothing, then, but satisfy all your fancies. You are
      expected to appear in the great world of Paris, in a style becoming the
      son of a king who was called the Father of the Generous. So once again I
      conjure you not to be restrained by a false delicacy; if this sum should
      not be sufficient&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask for more. My mother is right; the son of a monarch ought
      to live royally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the answer of the Indian, made with perfect simplicity, and
      without any appearance of astonishment at these magnificent offers. This
      was natural. Djalma would have done for others what they were doing for
      him, for the traditions of the prodigal magnificence and splendid
      hospitality of Indian princes are well known. Djalma had been as moved as
      grateful, on hearing that a woman loved him with maternal affection. As
      for the luxury with which she nought to surround him, he accepted it
      without astonishment and without scruple. This resignation, again,
      somewhat disconcerted Rodin, who had prepared many excellent arguments to
      persuade the Indian to accept his offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s all agreed, my dear prince,&rdquo; resumed
      the Jesuit. &ldquo;Now, as you must see the world, it&rsquo;s just as well
      to enter by the best door, as we say. One of the friends of your maternal
      protectress, the Count de Montbron, an old nobleman of the greatest
      experience, and belonging to the first society, will introduce you in some
      of the best houses in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not introduce me, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my dear prince, look at me. Tell me, if you think I am fitted
      for such an office. No! no; I live alone and retired from the world. And
      then,&rdquo; added Rodin, after a short silence, fixing a penetrating,
      attentive, and curious look upon the prince, as if he would have subjected
      him to a sort of experiment by what follows; &ldquo;and then, you see, M.
      de Montbron will be better able than I should, in the world you are about
      to enter, to enlighten you as to the snares that will be laid for you. For
      if you have friends, you have also enemies&mdash;cowardly enemies, as you
      know, who have abused your confidence in an infamous manner, and have made
      sport of you. And as, unfortunately, their power is equal to their
      wickedness, it would perhaps be more prudent in you to try to avoid them&mdash;to
      fly, instead of resisting them openly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the remembrance of his enemies, at the thought of flying from them,
      Djalma trembled in every limb; his features became of a lurid paleness;
      his eyes wide open, so that the pupil was encircled with white, sparkled
      with lurid fire; never had scorn, hatred, and the desire of vengeance,
      expressed themselves so terribly on a human face. His upper lip, blood
      red, was curled convulsively, exposing a row of small, white, and close
      set teeth, and giving to his countenance lately so charming, an air of
      such animal ferocity, that Rodin started from his seat, and exclaimed:
      &ldquo;What is the matter, prince? You frighten me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma did not answer. Half leaning forward, with his hands clinched in
      rage, he seemed to cling to one of the arms of the chair, for fear of
      yielding to a burst of terrific fury. At this moment, the amber mouthpiece
      of his pipe rolled, by chance, under one of his feet; the violent tension,
      which contracted all the muscles of the young Indian, was so powerful, and
      notwithstanding his youth and his light figure, he was endowed with such
      vigor, that with one abrupt stamp he powdered to dust the piece of amber,
      in spite of its extreme hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of heaven, what is the matter, prince?&rdquo; cried
      Rodin.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20413.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus would I crush my cowardly enemies!&rdquo; exclaimed Djalma,
      with menacing and excited look. Then, as if these words had brought his
      rage to a climax, he bounded from his seat, and, with haggard eyes, strode
      about the room for some seconds in all directions, as if he sought for
      some weapon, and uttered from time to time a hoarse cry, which he
      endeavored to stifle by thrusting his clinched fist against his mouth,
      whilst his jaws moved convulsively. It was the impotent rage of a wild
      beast, thirsting for blood. Yet, in all this, the young Indian preserved a
      great and savage beauty; it was evident that these instincts of sanguinary
      ardor and blind intrepidity, now excited to this pitch by horror of
      treachery and cowardice, when applied to war, or to those gigantic Indian
      hunts, which are even more bloody than a battle, must make of Djalma what
      he really was a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin admired, with deep and ominous joy, the fiery impetuosity of passion
      in the young Indian, for, under various conceivable circumstances, the
      effect must be terrible. Suddenly, to the Jesuit&rsquo;s great surprise,
      the tempest was appeased. Djalma&rsquo;s fury was calmed thus
      instantaneously, because refection showed him how vain it was: ashamed of
      his childish violence, he cast down his eyes. His countenance remained
      pale and gloomy; and, with a cold tranquillity, far more formidable than
      the violence to which he had yielded, he said to Rodin: &ldquo;Father, you
      will this day lead me to meet my enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what end, my dear prince? What would you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill the cowards!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill them! you must not think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faringhea will aid me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, you are not on the banks of the Ganges, and here one does
      not kill an enemy like a hunted tiger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One fights with a loyal enemy, but one kills a traitor like an
      accursed dog,&rdquo; replied Djalma, with as much conviction as
      tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, prince, whose father was the Father of the Generous,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, in a grave voice; &ldquo;what pleasure can you find in
      striking down creatures as cowardly as they are wicked?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To destroy what is dangerous, is a duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So prince, you seek for revenge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not revenge myself on a serpent,&rdquo; said the Indian, with
      haughty bitterness; &ldquo;I crush it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear prince, here we cannot get rid of our enemies in that
      manner. If we have cause of complaint&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women and children complain,&rdquo; said Djalma, interrupting
      Rodin: &ldquo;men strike.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still on the banks of the Ganges, my dear prince. Here society
      takes your cause into its own hands, examines, judges, and if there be
      good reason, punishes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my own quarrel, I am both judge and executioner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray listen to me; you have escaped the odious snares of your
      enemies, have you not?&mdash;Well! suppose it were thanks to the devotion
      of the venerable woman who has for you the tenderness of a mother, and
      that she were to ask you to forgive them&mdash;she, who saved you from
      their hands&mdash;what would you do then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian hung his head, and was silent. Profiting by his hesitation,
      Rodin continued: &ldquo;I might say to you that I know your enemies, but
      that in the dread of seeing you commit some terrible imprudence, I would
      conceal their names from you forever. But no! I swear to you, that if the
      respectable person, who loves you as her son, should find it either right
      or useful that I should tell you their names, I will do so&mdash;until she
      has pronounced, I must be silent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma looked at Rodin with a dark and wrathful air. At this moment,
      Faringhea entered, and said to Rodin: &ldquo;A man with a letter, not
      finding you at home, has been sent on here. Am I to receive it? He says it
      comes from the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Rodin. &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;with the prince&rsquo;s permission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma nodded in reply; Faringhea went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse what I have done, dear prince. I expected this
      morning a very important letter. As it was late in coming to hand, I
      ordered it to be sent on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after, Faringhea returned with the letter, which he
      delivered to Rodin&mdash;and the half-caste again withdrew.

      CHAPTER XLIV. ADRIENNE AND DJALMA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Faringhea had
      quitted the room, Rodin took the letter from Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny with
      one hand, and with the other appeared to be looking for something, first
      in the side pocket of his great-coat, then in the pocket behind, then in
      that of his trousers; and, not finding what he sought, he laid the letter
      on his knee, and felt himself all over with both hands, with an air of
      regret and uneasiness. The divers movements of this pantomime, performed
      in the most natural manner, were crowned by the exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear me! how vexatious!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Djalma, starting from the gloomy
      silence in which he had been plunged for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my dear prince!&rdquo; replied Rodin, &ldquo;the most vulgar
      and puerile accident may sometimes cause the greatest inconvenience. I
      have forgotten or lost my spectacles. Now, in this twilight, with the very
      poor eyesight that years of labor have left me, it will be absolutely
      impossible for me to read this most important letter&mdash;and an
      immediate answer is expected&mdash;most simple and categorical&mdash;a yes
      or a no. Times presses; it is really most annoying. If,&rdquo; added
      Rodin, laying great stress on his words, without looking at Djalma, but so
      as the prince might remark it; &ldquo;if only some one would render me the
      service to read it for me; but there is no one&mdash;no&mdash;one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Djalma, obligingly, &ldquo;shall I read it for
      you. When I have finished it, I shall forget what I have read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried Rodin, as if the proposition of the Indian had
      appeared to him extravagant and dangerous; &ldquo;it is impossible,
      prince, for you to read this letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then excuse my having offered,&rdquo; said Djalma mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
      and as if speaking to himself, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he added, addressing Djalma: &ldquo;Would you really be so obliging,
      my dear prince? I should not have ventured to ask you this service.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rodin delivered the letter to Djalma, who read aloud as
      follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;Your visit this morning to Saint-Dizier House can
      only be considered, from what I hear, as a new act of aggression on your
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here is the last proposition I have to make. It may be as
      fruitless as the step I took yesterday, when I called upon you in the Rue
      Clovis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;After that long and painful explanation, I told you that I
      would write to you. I keep my promise, and here is my ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;First of all, a piece of advice. Beware! If you are
      determined to maintain so unequal a struggle, you will be exposed even to
      the hatred of those whom you so foolishly seek to protect. There are a
      thousand ways to ruin you with them, by enlightening them as to your
      protects. It will be proved to them, that you have shared in the plat,
      which you now pretend to reveal, not from generosity, but from cupidity.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      Though Djalma had the delicacy to feel that the least question on the
      subject of this letter would be a serious indiscretion, he could not
      forbear turning his head suddenly towards the Jesuit, as he read the last
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! it relates to me. Such as you see me, my dear prince,&rdquo;
      added he, glancing at his shabby clothes, &ldquo;I am accused of cupidity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are these people that you protect?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those I protect?&rdquo; said Rodin feigning some hesitation, as if
      he had been embarrassed to find an answer; &ldquo;who are those I protect?
      Hem&mdash;hem&mdash;I will tell you. They are poor devils without
      resources; good people without a penny, having only a just cause on their
      side, in a lawsuit in which they are engaged. They are threatened with
      destruction by powerful parties&mdash;very powerful parties; but, happily,
      these latter are known to me, and I am able to unmask them. What else
      could have been? Being myself poor and weak, I range myself naturally on
      the side of the poor and weak. But continue, I beg of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma resumed: &ldquo;&lsquo;You have therefore every-thing to fear if
      you persist in your hostility, and nothing to gain by taking the side of
      those whom you call your friends. They might more justly be termed your
      dupes, for your disinterestedness would be inexplicable, were it sincere.
      It must therefore conceal some after-thought of cupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well! in that view of the case, we can offer you ample
      compensation&mdash;with this difference, that your hopes are now entirely
      founded on the probable gratitude of your friends, a very doubtful chance
      at the best, whereas our offers will be realized on the instant. To speak
      clearly, this is what we ask, what we exact of you. This very night,
      before twelve, you must have left Paris, and engage not to return for six
      months.&rsquo;&rdquo; Djalma could not repress a movement of surprise, and
      looked at Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite natural,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;the cause of my poor
      friends would be judged by that time, and I should be unable to watch over
      them. You see how it is, my dear prince,&rdquo; added Rodin, with bitter
      indignation. &ldquo;But please continue, and excuse me for having
      interrupted you; though, indeed, such impudence disgusts me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20421m.jpg" alt="20421m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20421.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Djalma continued: &ldquo;&lsquo;That we may be certain of your removal
      from Paris for six months, you will go to the house of one of our friends
      in Germany. You will there be received with generous hospitality, but
      forcibly detained until the expiration of the term.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! a voluntary prison,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On these conditions, you will receive a pension of one
      thousand francs a month, to begin from your departure from Paris, ten
      thousand francs down, and twenty thousand at the end of the six months&mdash;the
      whole to be completely secured to you. Finally, at the end of the six
      months, we will place you in a position both honorable and independent.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma having stopped short, with involuntary indignation, Rodin said to
      him: &ldquo;Let me beg you to continue, my dear prince. Read to the end,
      and it will give you some idea of what passes in the midst of our
      civilization.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma resumed: &ldquo;&lsquo;You know well enough the course of affairs,
      and what we are, to feel that in providing for your absence, we only wish
      to get rid of an enemy, not very dangerous, but rather troublesome. Do not
      be blinded by your first success. The results of your denunciation will be
      stifled, because they are calumnious. The judge who received your evidence
      will soon repent his odious partiality. You may make what use you please
      of this letter. We know what we write, to whom we write, and how we write.
      You will receive this letter at three o&rsquo;clock; if by four o&rsquo;clock
      we have not your full and complete acceptance, written with your own hand
      at the bottom of this letter, war must commence between us&mdash;and not
      from to-morrow, but on the instant.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished reading the letter, Djalma looked at Rodin, who said to
      him: &ldquo;Permit me to summon Faringhea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell, and the half-caste appeared. Rodin took the letter from
      the hands of Djalma, tore it into halves, rubbed it between his palms, so
      as to make a sort of a ball, and said to the half-caste, as he returned it
      to him: &ldquo;Give this palter to the person who waits for it, and tell
      him that is my only answer to his shameless and insolent letter; you
      understand me&mdash;this shameless and insolent letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; said the half-caste; and he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will perhaps be a dangerous war for you, father, said the
      Indian, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear prince, it may be dangerous, but I am not like you; I
      have no wish to kill my enemies, because they are cowardly and wicked. I
      fight them under the shield of the law. Imitate me in this.&rdquo; Then,
      seeing that the countenance of Djalma darkened, he added: &ldquo;I am
      wrong. I will advise you no more on this subject. Only, let us defer the
      decision to the judgment of your noble and motherly protectress. I shall
      see her to morrow; if she consents, I will tell you the names of your
      enemies. If not&mdash;not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this woman, this second mother,&rdquo; said Djalma, &ldquo;is
      her character such, that I can rely on her judgment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She!&rdquo; cried Rodin, clasping his hands, and speaking with
      increased excitement. &ldquo;Why, she is the most noble, the most
      generous, the most valiant being upon earth!&mdash;why, if you were really
      her son, and she loved you with all the strength of maternal affection,
      and a case arose in which you had to choose between an act of baseness and
      death, she would say to you: &lsquo;Die!&rsquo; though she might herself
      die with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, noble woman! so was my mother!&rdquo; cried Djalma, with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, with growing energy, as he approached
      the window concealed by the shade, towards which he threw an oblique and
      anxious glance, &ldquo;if you would imagine your protectress, think only
      of courage, uprightness, and loyalty personified. Oh! she has the
      chivalrous frankness of the brave man, joined with the high-souled dignity
      of the woman, who not only never in her life told a falsehood, never
      concealed a single thought, but who would rather die than give way to the
      least of those sentiments of craft and dissimulation, which are almost
      forced upon ordinary women by the situation in which they are placed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to express the admiration which shone upon the countenance
      of Djalma, as he listened to this description. His eyes sparkled, his
      cheeks glowed, his heart palpitated with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well, noble heart!&rdquo; said Rodin to him, drawing still
      nearer to the blind; &ldquo;I love to see your soul sparkle through your
      eyes, on hearing me speak thus of your unknown protectress. Oh! but she is
      worthy of the pious adoration which noble hearts and great characters
      inspire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I believe you,&rdquo; cried Djalma, with enthusiasm; &ldquo;my
      heart is full of admiration and also of astonishment, for my mother is no
      more, and yet such a woman exists!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she exists. For the consolation of the afflicted, for the
      glory of her sex, she exists. For the honor of truth, and the shame of
      falsehood, she exists. No lie, no disguise, has ever tainted her loyalty,
      brilliant and heroic as the sword of a knight. It is but a few days ago
      that this noble woman spoke to me these admirable words, which, in all my
      life, I shall not forget: &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if ever I
      suspect any one that I love or esteem&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin did not finish. The shade, so violently shaken that the spring
      broke, was drawn up abruptly, and, to the great astonishment of Djalma,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville appeared before him. Adrienne&rsquo;s cloak had
      fallen from her shoulders, and in the violence of the movement with which
      she had approached the blind, her bonnet, the strings of which were
      untied, had also fallen. Having left home suddenly, with only just time to
      throw a mantle over the picturesque and charming costume which she often
      chose to wear when alone, she appeared so radiant with beauty to Djalma&rsquo;s
      dazzled eyes, in the centre of those leaves and flowers, that the Indian
      believed himself under the influence of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      With clasped hands, eyes wide open, the body slightly bent forward, as if
      in the act of prayer, he stood petrified with admiration, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, much agitated, and her countenance glowing with emotion,
      remained on the threshold of the greenhouse, without entering the room.
      All this had passed in less time than it takes to describe it. Hardly had
      the blind been raised, than Rodin, feigning surprise, exclaimed: &ldquo;You
      here, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; said Adrienne, in an agitated voice, &ldquo;I come
      to terminate the phrase which you have commenced. I told you, that when a
      suspicion crossed my mind, I uttered it aloud to the person by whom it was
      inspired. Well! I confess it: I have failed in this honesty. I came here
      as a spy upon you, when your answer to the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny was
      giving me a new pledge of your devotion and sincerity. I doubted your
      uprightness at the moment when you were bearing testimony to my frankness.
      For the first time in my life, I stooped to deceit; this weakness merits
      punishment, and I submit to it&mdash;demands reparation, and I make it&mdash;calls
      for apologies, and I tender them to you.&rdquo; Then turning towards
      Djalma, she added: &ldquo;Now, prince, I am no longer mistress of my
      secret. I am your relation, Mdlle. de Cardoville; and I hope you will
      accept from a sister the hospitality that you did not refuse from a
      mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma made no reply. Plunged in ecstatic contemplation of this sudden
      apparition, which surpassed his wildest and most dazzling visions, he felt
      a sort of intoxication, which, paralyzing the power of thought,
      concentrated all his faculties in the one sense of sight; and just as we
      sometimes seek in vain to satisfy unquenchable thirst, the burning look of
      the Indian sought, as it were, with devouring avidity, to take in all the
      rare perfections of the young lady. Verily, never had two more divine
      types of beauty met face to face. Adrienne and Djalma were the very ideal
      of a handsome youth and maiden. There seemed to be something providential
      in the meeting of these two natures, so young and so vivacious, so
      generous and so full of passion, so heroic and so proud, who, before
      coming into contact, had, singularly enough, each learned the moral worth
      of the other; for if, at the words of Rodin, Djalma had felt arise in his
      heart an admiration, as lively as it was sudden, for the valiant and
      generous qualities of that unknown benefactress, whom he now discovered in
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, the latter had, in her turn, been moved, affected,
      almost terrified, by the interview she had just overheard, in which Djalma
      had displayed the nobleness of his soul, the delicate goodness of his
      heart, and the terrible transports of his temper. Then she had not been
      able to repress a movement of astonishment, almost admiration, at sight of
      the surprising beauty of the prince; and soon after, a strange, painful
      sentiment, a sort of electric shock, seemed to penetrate all her being, as
      her eyes encountered Djalma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cruelly agitated, and suffering deeply from this agitation, she tried to
      dissemble the impression she had received, by addressing Rodin, to
      apologize for having suspected him. But the obstinate silence of the
      Indian redoubled the lady&rsquo;s painful embarrassment. Again raising her
      eyes towards the prince, to invite him to respond to her fraternal offer,
      she met his ardent gaze wildly fixed upon her, and she looked once more
      with a mixture of fear, sadness, and wounded pride; then she congratulated
      herself on having foreseen the inexorable necessity of keeping Djalma at a
      distance from her, such apprehension did this ardent and impetuous nature
      already inspire. Wishing to put an end to her present painful situation,
      she said to Rodin, in a low and trembling voice, &ldquo;Pray, sir, speak
      to the prince; repeat to him my offers. I cannot remain longer.&rdquo; So
      saying, Adrienne turned, as if to rejoin Florine. But, at the first step,
      Djalma sprang towards her with the bound of a tiger, about to be deprived
      of his prey. Terrified by the expression of wild excitement which inflamed
      the Indian&rsquo;s countenance, the young lady drew back with a loud
      scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Djalma remembered himself, and all that had passed. Pale with
      regret and shame, trembling, dismayed, his eyes streaming with tears, and
      all his features marked with an expression of the most touching despair,
      he fell at Adrienne&rsquo;s feet, and lifting his clasped hands towards
      her, said in a soft, supplicating, timid voice: &ldquo;Oh, remain! remain!
      do not leave me. I have waited for you so long!&rdquo; To this prayer,
      uttered with the timid simplicity of a child, and a resignation which
      contrasted strangely with the savage violence that had so frightened
      Adrienne, she replied, as she made a sign to Florine to prepare for their
      departure: &ldquo;Prince, it is impossible for me to remain longer here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will return?&rdquo; said Djalma, striving to restrain his
      tears. &ldquo;I shall see you again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! never&mdash;never!&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, in a
      failing voice. Then, profiting by the stupor into which her answer had
      thrown Djalma, Adrienne disappeared rapidly behind the plants in the
      greenhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine was hastening to rejoin her mistress, when, just at the moment she
      passed before Rodin, he said to her in a low, quick voice: &ldquo;To-morrow
      we must finish with the hunchback.&rdquo; Florine trembled in every limb,
      and, without answering Rodin, disappeared, like her mistress, behind the
      plants. Broken, overpowered, Djalma remained upon his knees, with his head
      resting on his breast. His countenance expressed neither rage nor
      excitement, but a painful stupor; he wept silently. Seeing Rodin approach
      him, he rose, but with so tremulous a step, that he could hardly reach the
      divan, on which he sank down, hiding his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Rodin, advancing, said to him in a mild and insinuating tone: &ldquo;Alas!
      I feared what has happened. I did not wish you to see your benefactress;
      and if I told you she was old, do you know why, dear prince?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma, without answering, let his hands fall upon his knees, and turned
      towards Rodin a countenance still bathed in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that Mdlle. de Cardoville was charming, and at your age it
      is so easy to fall in love,&rdquo; continued Rodin; &ldquo;I wished to
      spare you that misfortune, my dear prince, for your beautiful protectress
      passionately loves a handsome young man of this town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon these words, Djalma suddenly pressed both hands to his heart, as if
      he felt a piercing stab, uttered a cry of savage grief, threw back his
      head, and fell fainting upon the divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked at him coldly for some seconds, and then said as he went
      away, brushing his old hat with his elbow,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! it works&mdash;it works!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XLV. THE CONSULTATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is night. It has
      just struck nine. It is the evening of that day on which Mdlle. de
      Cardoville first found herself in the presence of Djalma. Florine, pale,
      agitated, trembling, with a candle in her hand, had just entered a
      bedroom, plainly but comfortably furnished. This room was one of the
      apartments occupied by Mother Bunch, in Adrienne&rsquo;s house. They were
      situated on the ground-floor, and had two entrances. One opened on the
      garden, and the other on the court-yard. From this side came the persons
      who applied to the workgirl for succor; an ante-chamber in which they
      waited, a parlor in which they were received, constituted Mother Bunch&rsquo;s
      apartments, along with the bedroom, which Florine had just entered,
      looking about her with an anxious and alarmed air, scarcely touching the
      carpet with the tips of her satin shoes, holding her breath, and listening
      at the least noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the candle upon the chimney-piece, she took a rapid survey of the
      chamber, and approached the mahogany desk, surmounted by a well-filled
      bookcase. The key had been left in the drawers of this piece of furniture,
      and they were all three examined by Florine. They contained different
      petitions from persons in distress, and various, notes in the girl&rsquo;s
      handwriting. This was not what Florine wanted. Three cardboard boxes were
      placed in pigeon-holes beneath the bookcase. These also were vainly
      explored, and Florine, with a gesture of vexation, looked and listened
      anxiously; then, seeing a chest of drawers, she made therein a fresh and
      useless search. Near the foot of the bed was a little door, leading to a
      dressing-room. Florine entered it, and looked&mdash;at first without
      success&mdash;into a large wardrobe, in which were suspended several black
      dresses, recently made for Mother Bunch, by order of Mdlle. de Cardoville.
      Perceiving, at the bottom of this wardrobe, half hidden beneath a cloak, a
      very shabby little trunk, Florine opened it hastily, and found there,
      carefully folded up, the poor old garments in which the work-girl had been
      clad when she first entered this opulent mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine started&mdash;an involuntary emotion contracted her features; but
      considering that she had not liberty to indulge her feelings, but only to
      obey Rodin&rsquo;s implacable orders, she hastily closed both trunk and
      wardrobe, and leaving the dressing-room, returned into the bed-chamber.
      After having again examined the writing-stand, a sudden idea occurred to
      her. Not content with once more searching the cardboard boxes, she drew
      out one of them from the pigeon-hole, hoping to find what she sought
      behind the box: her first attempt failed, but the second was more
      successful. She found behind the middle box a copy-book of considerable
      thickness. She started in surprise, for she had expected something else;
      yet she took the manuscript, opened it, and rapidly turned over the
      leaves. After having perused several pages, she manifested her
      satisfaction, and seemed as if about to put the book in her pocket; but
      after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, she replaced it where she had found it,
      arranged everything in order, took her candle, and quitted the apartment
      without being discovered&mdash;of which, indeed, she had felt pretty sure,
      knowing that Mother Bunch would be occupied with Mdlle. de Cardoville for
      some hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after Florine&rsquo;s researches, Mother Bunch, alone in her bed
      chamber, was seated in an arm-chair, close to a good fire. A thick carpet
      covered the floor; through the window-curtains could be seen the lawn of a
      large garden; the deep silence was only interrupted by the regular ticking
      of a clock, and the crackling of the wood. Her hands resting on the arms
      of the chair, she gave way to a feeling of happiness, such as she had
      never so completely enjoyed since she took up her residence at the hotel.
      For her, accustomed so long to cruel privations, there was a kind of
      inexpressible charm in the calm silence of this retreat&mdash;in the
      cheerful aspect of the garden, and above all, in the consciousness that
      she was indebted for this comfortable position, to the resignation and
      energy she had displayed, in the thick of the many severe trials which now
      ended so happily. An old woman, with a mild and friendly countenance, who
      had been, by express desire of Adrienne, attached to the hunchback&rsquo;s
      service, entered the room and said to her: &ldquo;Mademoiselle, a young
      man wishes to speak to you on pressing business. He gives his name as
      Agricola Baudoin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this name, Mother Bunch uttered an exclamation of surprise and joy,
      blushed slightly, rose and ran to the door which led to the parlor in
      which was Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, dear sister,&rdquo; said the smith, cordially
      embracing the young girl, whose cheeks burned crimson beneath those
      fraternal kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo; cried the sempstress on a sudden, as she looked
      anxiously at Agricola; &ldquo;what is that black band on your forehead?
      You have been wounded!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20429m.jpg" alt="20429m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20429.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere nothing,&rdquo; said the smith, &ldquo;really nothing. Do
      not think of it. I will tell you all about that presently. But first, I
      have things of importance to communicate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into my room, then; we shall be alone,&rdquo; Mother Bunch, as
      she went before Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the expression of uneasiness which was visible on the
      countenance of Agricola, he could not forbear smiling with pleasure as he
      entered the room and looked around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, my poor sister! this is how I would always have you
      lodged. I recognize here the hand of Mdlle. de Cardoville. What a heart!
      what a noble mind!&mdash;Dost know, she wrote to me the day before
      yesterday, to thank me for what I had done for her, and sent me a gold pin
      (very plain), which she said I need not hesitate to accept, as it had no
      other value but that of having been worn by her mother! You can&rsquo;t
      tell how much I was affected by the delicacy of this gift!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing must astonish you from a heart like hers,&rdquo; answered
      the hunchback. &ldquo;But the wound&mdash;the wound?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, my good sister; I have so many things to tell you. Let
      us begin by what is most pressing, for I want you to give me some good
      advice in a very serious case. You know how much confidence I have in your
      excellent heart and judgment. And then, I have to ask of you a service&mdash;oh!
      a great service,&rdquo; added the smith, in an earnest, and almost solemn
      tone, which astonished his hearer. &ldquo;Let us begin with what is not
      personal to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak quickly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since my mother went with Gabriel to the little country curacy he
      has obtained, and since my father lodges with Marshal Simon and the young
      ladies, I have resided, you know, with my mates, at M. Hardy&rsquo;s
      factory, in the common dwelling-house. Now, this morning but first, I must
      tell you that M. Hardy, who has lately returned from a journey, is again
      absent for a few days on business. This morning, then, at the hour of
      breakfast, I remained at work a little after the last stroke of the bell;
      I was leaving the workshop to go to our eating-room, when I saw entering
      the courtyard, a lady who had just got out of a hackney-coach. I remarked
      that she was fair, though her veil was half down; she had a mild and
      pretty countenance, and her dress was that of a fashionable lady. Struck
      with her paleness, and her anxious, frightened air, I asked her if she
      wanted anything. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said she to me, in a trembling voice,
      and as if with a great effort, &lsquo;do you belong to this factory?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,
      madame.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;M. Hardy is then in clanger?&rsquo; she
      exclaimed.&mdash;&lsquo;M. Hardy, madame? He has not yet returned home.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What!&rsquo;
      she went on, &lsquo;M. Hardy did not come hither yesterday evening? Was he
      not dangerously wounded by some of the machinery?&rsquo; As she said these
      words, the poor young lady&rsquo;s lips trembled, and I saw large tears
      standing in her eyes. &lsquo;Thank God, madame! all this is entirely
      false,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for M. Hardy has not returned, and indeed is
      only expected by to-morrow or the day after.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You are
      quite sure that he has not returned! quite sure that he is not hurt?&rsquo;
      resumed the pretty young lady, drying her eyes.&mdash;&lsquo;Quite sure,
      madame; if M. Hardy were in danger, I should not be so quiet in talking to
      you about him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! thank God! thank God!&rsquo; cried
      the young lady. Then she expressed to me her gratitude, with so happy, so
      feeling an air, that I was quite touched by it. But suddenly, as if then
      only she felt ashamed of the step she had taken, she let down her veil,
      left me precipitately, went out of the court-yard, and got once more into
      the hackney-coach that had brought her. I said to myself: &lsquo;This is a
      lady who takes great interest in M. Hardy, and has been alarmed by a false
      report.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves him, doubtless,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, much moved,
      &ldquo;and, in her anxiety, she perhaps committed an act of imprudence, in
      coming to inquire after him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only too true. I saw her get into the coach with interests,
      for her emotion had infected me. The coach started&mdash;and what did I
      see a few seconds after? A cab, which the young lady could not have
      perceived, for it had been hidden by an angle of the wall; and, as it
      turned round the corner, I distinguished perfectly a man seated by the
      driver&rsquo;s side, and making signs to him to take the same road as the
      hackney-coach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor young lady was followed,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it; so I instantly hastened after the coach, reached
      it, and through the blinds that were let down, I said to the young lady,
      whilst I kept running by the side of the coach door: &lsquo;Take care,
      madame; you are followed by a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Agricola! and what did she answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard her exclaim, &lsquo;Great Heaven!&rsquo; with an accent of
      despair. The coach continued its course. The cab soon came up with me; I
      saw, by the side of the driver, a great, fat, ruddy man, who, having
      watched me running after the coach, no doubt suspected something, for he
      looked at me somewhat uneasily.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when does M. Hardy return?&rdquo; asked the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, or the day after. Now, my good sister, advise me. It is
      evident that this young lady loves M. Hardy. She is probably married, for
      she looked so embarrassed when she spoke to me, and she uttered a cry of
      terror on learning that she was followed. What shall I do? I wished to ask
      advice of Father Simon, but he is so very strict in such matters&mdash;and
      then a love affair, at his age!&mdash;while you are so delicate and
      sensible, my good sister, that you will understand it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl started, and smiled bitterly; Agricola did not perceive it, and
      thus continued: &ldquo;So I said to myself, &lsquo;There is only Mother
      Bunch, who can give me good advice.&rsquo; Suppose M. Hardy returns
      to-morrow, shall I tell him what has passed or not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; cried the other, suddenly interrupting
      Agricola, and appearing to recollect something; &ldquo;when I went to St.
      Mary&rsquo;s Convent, to ask for work of the superior, she proposed that I
      should be employed by the day, in a house in which I was to watch or, in
      other words, to act as a spy&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wretch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;with whom I was to
      begin this odious trade? Why, with a Madame de-Fremont, or de Bremont, I
      do not remember which, a very religious woman, whose daughter, a young
      married lady, received visits a great deal too frequent (according to the
      superior) from a certain manufacturer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cried Agricola. &ldquo;This manufacturer
      must be&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy. I had too many reasons to remember that name, when it was
      pronounced by the superior. Since that day, so many other events have
      taken place, that I had almost forgotten the circumstance. But it is
      probable that this young lady is the one of whom I heard speak at the
      convent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what interest had the superior of the convent to set a spy upon
      her?&rdquo; asked the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know; but it is clear that the same interest still exists,
      since the young lady was followed, and perhaps, at this hour, is
      discovered and dishonored. Oh! it is dreadful!&rdquo; Then, seeing
      Agricola start suddenly, Mother Bunch added: &ldquo;What, then, is the
      matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;why not?&rdquo; said the smith, speaking to himself;
      &ldquo;why may not all this be the work of the same hand? The superior of
      a convent may have a private understanding with an abbe&mdash;but, then,
      for what end?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself, Agricola,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;And then,&mdash;where
      did you get your wound? Tell me that, I conjure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of my wound that I am just going to speak; for in truth, the
      more I think of it, the more this adventure of the young lady seems to
      connect itself with other facts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know that, for the last few days, singular things are
      passing in the neighborhood of our factory. First, as we are in Lent, an
      abbe from Paris (a tall, fine-looking man, they say) has come to preach in
      the little village of Villiers, which is only a quarter of a league from
      our works. The abbe has found occasion to slander and attack M. Hardy in
      his sermons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy has printed certain rules with regard to our work, and the
      rights and benefits he grants us. These rules are followed by various
      maxims as noble as they are simple; with precepts of brotherly love such
      as all the world can understand, extracted from different philosophies and
      different religions. But because M. Hardy has chosen what is best in all
      religions, the abbe concludes that M. Hardy has no religion at all, and he
      has therefore not only attacked him for this in the pulpit, but has
      denounced our factory as a centre of perdition and damnable corruption,
      because, on Sundays, instead of going to listen to his sermons, or to
      drink at a tavern, our comrades, with their wives and children, pass their
      time in cultivating their little gardens, in reading, singing in chorus,
      or dancing together in the common dwelling house. The abbe has even gone
      so far as to say, that the neighborhood of such an assemblage of atheists,
      as he calls us, might draw down the anger of Heaven upon the country&mdash;that
      the hovering of Cholera was much talked of, and that very possibly, thanks
      to our impious presence, the plague might fall upon all our neighborhood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to tell such things to ignorant people,&rdquo; exclaimed Mother
      Bunch, &ldquo;is likely to excite them to fatal actions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what the abbe wants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you tell me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people of the environs, still more excited, no doubt by other
      agitators, show themselves hostile to the workmen of our factory. Their
      hatred, or at least their envy, has been turned to account. Seeing us live
      all together, well lodged, well warmed, and comfortably clad, active, gay,
      and laborious, their jealousy has been embittered by the sermons, and by
      the secret manoeuvres of some depraved characters, who are known to be bad
      workmen, in the employment of M. Tripeaud, our opposition. All this
      excitement is beginning to bear fruit; there have been already two or
      three fights between us and our neighbors. It was in one of these
      skirmishes that I received a blow with a stone on my head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not serious, Agricola?&mdash;are you quite sure?&rdquo; said
      Mother Bunch, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing at all, I tell you. But the enemies of M. Hardy have
      not confined themselves to preaching. They have brought into play something
      far more dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, and nearly all my comrades, did our part in the three
      Revolutionary days of July; but we are not eager at present, for good
      reasons, to take up arms again. That is not everybody&rsquo;s opinion;
      well, we do not blame others, but we have our own ideas; and Father Simon,
      who is as brave as his son, and as good a patriot as any one, approves and
      directs us. Now, for some days past, we find all about the factory, in the
      garden, in the courts, printed papers to this effect: &lsquo;You are
      selfish cowards; because chance has given you a good master, you remain
      indifferent to the misfortunes of your brothers, and to the means of
      freeing them; material comforts have enervated your hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Agricola! what frightful perseverance in wickedness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! and unfortunately these devices have their effect on some of
      our younger mates. As the appeal was, after all, to proud and generous
      sentiments, it has had some influence. Already, seeds of division have
      shown themselves in our workshops, where, before, all were united as
      brothers. A secret agitation now reigns there. Cold suspicion takes the
      place, with some, of our accustomed cordiality. Now, if I tell you that I
      am nearly sure these printed papers, thrown over the walls of our factory,
      to raise these little sparks of discord amongst us, have been scattered
      about by the emissaries of this same preaching abbe&mdash;would it not
      seem from all this, taken in conjunction with what happened this morning
      to the young lady, that M. Hardy has of late numerous enemies?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you, I think it very fearful, Agricola,&rdquo; said the girl;
      &ldquo;and it is so serious, that M. Hardy alone can take a proper
      decision on the subject. As for what happened this morning to the young
      lady, it appears to me, that, immediately on M. Hardy&rsquo;s return, you
      should ask for an interview with him, and, however delicate such a
      communication may be, tell him all that passed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the difficulty. Shall I not seem as if wishing to pry into
      his secrets?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the young lady had not been followed, I should have shared your
      scruples. But she was watched, and is evidently in danger. It is
      therefore, in my opinion, your duty to warn M. Hardy. Suppose (which is
      not improbable) that the lady is married; would it not be better, for a
      thousand reasons, that M. Hardy should know all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my good sister; I will follow your advice. M. Hardy
      shall know everything. But now that we have spoken of others, I have to
      speak of myself&mdash;yes, of myself&mdash;for it concerns a matter, on
      which may depend the happiness of my whole life,&rdquo; added the smith,
      in a tone of seriousness, which struck his hearer. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo;
      proceeded Agricola, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;that, from my
      childhood, I have never concealed anything from you&mdash;that I have told
      you everything&mdash;absolutely everything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Agricola, I know it,&rdquo; said the hunchback,
      stretching out her white and slender hand to the smith, who grasped it
      cordially, and thus continued: &ldquo;When I say everything, I am not
      quite exact&mdash;for I have always concealed from you my little
      love-affairs&mdash;because, though we may tell almost anything to a
      sister, there are subjects of which we ought not to speak to a good and
      virtuous girl, such as you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Agricola. I had remarked this reserve on your part,&rdquo;
      observed the other, casting down her eyes, and heroically repressing the
      grief she felt; &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for the very reason, that I made it a duty never to speak to
      you of such love affairs, I said to myself, if ever it should happen that
      I have a serious passion&mdash;such a love as makes one think of marriage&mdash;oh!
      then, just as we tell our sister even before our father and mother, my
      good sister shall be the first to be informed of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then! the serious passion has come at last. I am over head and
      ears in love, and I think of marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words of Agricola, poor Mother Bunch felt herself for an instant
      paralyzed. It seemed as if all her blood was suddenly frozen in her veins.
      For some seconds, she thought she was going to die. Her heart ceased to
      beat; she felt it, not breaking, but melting away to nothing. Then, the
      first blasting emotion over, like those martyrs who found, in the very
      excitement of pain, the terrible power to smile in the midst of tortures,
      the unfortunate girl found, in the fear of betraying the secret of her
      fatal and ridiculous love, almost incredible energy. She raised her head,
      looked at the smith calmly, almost serenely, and said to him in a firm
      voice: &ldquo;Ah! so, you truly love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, my good sister, that, for the last four days, I
      scarcely live at all&mdash;or live only upon this passion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only since four days that you have been in love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more&mdash;but time has nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is she very pretty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dark hair&mdash;the figure of a nymph&mdash;fair as a lily&mdash;blue
      eyes, as large as that&mdash;and as mild, as good as your own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flatter me, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it is Angela that I flatter&mdash;for that&rsquo;s her
      name. What a pretty one! Is it not, my good Mother Bunch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming name,&rdquo; said the poor girl, contrasting bitterly
      that graceful appellation with her own nickname, which the thoughtless
      Agricola applied to her without thinking of it. Then she resumed, with
      fearful calmness: &ldquo;Angela? yes, it is a charming name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! imagine to yourself, that this name is not only suited
      to her face, but to her heart. In a word, I believe her heart to be almost
      equal to yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has my eyes&mdash;she has my heart,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch,
      smiling. &ldquo;It is singular, how like we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola did not perceive the irony of despair contained in these words.
      He resumed, with a tenderness as sincere as it was inexorable: &ldquo;Do
      you think, my good girl, that I could ever have fallen seriously in love
      with any one, who had not in character, heart, and mind, much of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, brother,&rdquo; said the girl, smiling&mdash;yes, the
      unfortunate creature had the strength to smile; &ldquo;come, brother, you
      are in a gallant vein to day. Where did you make the acquaintance of this
      beautiful young person?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is only the sister of one of my mates. Her mother is the head
      laundress in our common dwelling, and as she was in want of assistance,
      and we always take in preference the relations of members of the
      association, Mrs. Bertin (that&rsquo;s the mother&rsquo;s name) sent for
      her daughter from Lille, where she had been stopping with one of her
      aunts, and, for the last five days, she has been in the laundry. The first
      evening I saw her, I passed three hours, after work was over, in talking
      with her, and her mother and brother; and the next day, I felt that my
      heart was gone; the day after that, the feeling was only stronger&mdash;and
      now I am quite mad about her, and resolved on marriage&mdash;according as
      you shall decide. Do not be surprised at this; everything depends upon
      you. I shall only ask my father and mother&rsquo;s leave, after I have
      yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the utter confidence I have in the incredible instinct of
      your heart. Many times, you have said to me: &lsquo;Agricola, love this
      person, love that person, have confidence in that other&rsquo;&mdash;and
      never yet were you deceived. Well! you must now render me the same
      service. You will ask permission of Mdlle. de Cardoville to absent
      yourself; I will take you to the factory: I have spoken of you to Mrs.
      Benin and her daughter, as of a beloved sister; and, according to your
      impression at sight of Angela, I will declare myself or not. This may be
      childishness, or superstition, on my part; but I am so made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20437.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch, with heroic courage;
      &ldquo;I will see Mdlle. Angela; I will tell you what I think of her&mdash;and
      that, mind you, sincerely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. When will you come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask Mdlle. de Cardoville what day she can spare sue. I will
      let you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, my good sister!&rdquo; said Agricola warmly; then he added,
      with a smile: &ldquo;Bring your best judgment with you&mdash;your full
      dress judgment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not make a jest of it, brother,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, in a
      mild, sad voice; &ldquo;it is a serious matter, for it concerns the
      happiness of your whole life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, a modest knock was heard at the door. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
      said Mother Bunch. Florine appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress begs that you will come to her, if you are not engaged,&rdquo;
      said Florine to Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter rose, and, addressing the smith, said to him: &ldquo;Please
      wait a moment, Agricola. I will ask Mdlle. de Cardoville what day I can
      dispose of, and I will come and tell you.&rdquo; So saying, the girl went
      out, leaving Agricola with Florine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have much wished to pay my respects to Mdlle. de
      Cardoville,&rdquo; said Agricola; &ldquo;but I feared to intrude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady is not quite well, sir,&rdquo; said Florine, &ldquo;and
      receives no one to day. I am sure, that as soon as she is better, she will
      be quite pleased to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mother Bunch returned, and said to Agricola: &ldquo;If you can come
      for me to-morrow, about three o&rsquo;clock, so as not to lose the whole
      day, we will go to the factory, and you can bring me back in the evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, at three o&rsquo;clock to-morrow, my good sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At three to-morrow, Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of that same day, when all was quiet in the hotel, Mother
      Bunch, who had remained till ten o&rsquo;clock with Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      re entered her bedchamber, locked the door after her, and finding herself
      at length free and unrestrained, threw herself on her knees before a
      chair, and burst into tears. She wept long&mdash;very long. When her tears
      at length ceased to flow, she dried her eyes, approached the writing-desk,
      drew out one of the boxes from the pigeonhole, and, taking from this
      hiding-place the manuscript which Florine had so rapidly glanced over the
      evening before, she wrote in it during a portion of the night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. MOTHER BUNCH&rsquo;S DIARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e have said that
      the hunchback wrote during a portion of the night, in the book discovered
      the previous evening by Florine, who had not ventured to take it away,
      until she had informed the persons who employed her of its contents, and
      until she had received their final orders on the subject. Let us explain
      the existence of this manuscript, before opening it to the reader. The day
      on which Mother Bunch first became aware of her love for Agricola, the
      first word of this manuscript had been written. Endowed with an
      essentially trusting character, yet always feeling herself restrained by
      the dread of ridicule&mdash;a dread which, in its painful exaggeration,
      was the workgirl&rsquo;s only weakness&mdash;to whom could the unfortunate
      creature have confided the secret of that fatal passion, if not to paper&mdash;that
      mute confidant of timid and suffering souls, that patient friend, silent
      and cold, who, if it makes no reply to heart rending complaints, at least
      always listens, and never forgets?
    </p>
    <p>
      When her heart was overflowing with emotion, sometimes mild and sad,
      sometimes harsh and bitter, the poor workgirl, finding a melancholy charm
      in these dumb and solitary outpourings of the soul, now clothed in the
      form of simple and touching poetry, and now in unaffected prose, had
      accustomed herself by degrees not to confine her confidences to what
      immediately related to Agricola, for though he might be mixed up with all
      her thoughts, for reflections, which the sight of beauty, of happy love,
      of maternity, of wealth, of misfortune, called up within her, were so
      impressed with the influence of her unfortunate personal position, that
      she would not even have dared to communicate them to him. Such, then, was
      this journal of a poor daughter of the people, weak, deformed, and
      miserable, but endowed with an angelic soul, and a fine intellect,
      improved by reading, meditation, and solitude; pages quite unknown, which
      yet contained many deep and striking views, both as regard men and things,
      taken from the peculiar standpoint in which fate had placed this
      unfortunate creature. The following lines, here and there abruptly
      interrupted or stained with tears, according to the current of her various
      emotions, on hearing of Agricola&rsquo;s deep love for Angela, formed the
      last pages of this journal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday, March 3d, 1832.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spent the night without any painful dreams. This morning, I rose
      with no sorrowful presentiment. I was calm and tranquil when Agricola
      came. He did not appear to me agitated. He was simple and affectionate as
      he always is. He spoke to me of events relating to M. Hardy, and then,
      without transition, without hesitation, he said to me: &lsquo;The last
      four days I have been desperately in love. The sentiment is so serious,
      that I think of marriage. I have come to consult you about it.&rsquo; That
      was how this overwhelming revelation was made to me&mdash;naturally and
      cordially&mdash;I on one side of the hearth, and Agricola an the other, as
      if we had talked of indifferent things. And yet no more is needed to break
      one&rsquo;s heart. Some one enters, embraces you like a brother, sits
      down, talks&mdash;and then&mdash;Oh! Merciful heaven! my head wanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel calmer now. Courage, my poor heart, courage!&mdash;Should a
      day of misfortune again overwhelm me, I will read these lines written
      under the impression of the most cruel grief I can ever feel, and I will
      say to myself: &lsquo;What is the present woe compared to that past?&rsquo;
      My grief is indeed cruel! it is illegitimate, ridiculous, shameful: I
      should not dare to confess it, even to the most indulgent of mothers.
      Alas! there are some fearful sorrows, which yet rightly make men shrug
      their shoulders in pity or contempt. Alas! these are forbidden
      misfortunes. Agricola has asked me to go to-morrow, to see this young girl
      to whom he is so passionately attached, and whom he will marry, if the
      instinct of my heart should approve the marriage. This thought is the most
      painful of all those which have tortured me since he so pitilessly
      announced this love. Pitilessly? No, Agricola&mdash;no, my brother&mdash;forgive
      me this unjust cry of pain! Is it that you know, can even suspect, that I
      love you better than you love, better than you can ever love, this
      charming creature?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dark-haired&mdash;the figure of a nymph&mdash;fair as a lily&mdash;with
      blue eyes&mdash;as large as that&mdash;and almost as mild as your own.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the portrait he drew of her. Poor Agricola! how would he
      have suffered, had he known that every one of his words was tearing my
      heart. Never did I so strongly feel the deep commiseration and tender
      pity, inspired by a good, affectionate being, who, in the sincerity of his
      ignorance, gives you your death-wound with a smile. We do not blame him&mdash;no&mdash;we
      pity him to the full extent of the grief that he would feel on learning
      the pain he had caused me. It is strange! but never did Agricola appear to
      me more handsome than this morning. His manly countenance was slightly
      agitated, as he spoke of the uneasiness of that pretty young lady. As I
      listened to him describing the agony of a woman who runs the risk of ruin
      for the man she loves, I felt my heart beat violently, my hands were
      burning, a soft languor floated over me&mdash;Ridiculous folly! As if I
      had any right to feel thus!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember that, while he spoke, I cast a rapid glance at the
      glass. I felt proud that I was so well dressed; he had not even remarked
      it; but no matter&mdash;it seemed to me that my cap became me, that my
      hair shone finely, my gaze beamed mild&mdash;I found Agricola so handsome,
      that I almost began to think myself less ugly&mdash;no doubt, to excuse
      myself in my own eyes for daring to love him. After all, what happened
      to-day would have happened one day or another! Yes, that is consoling&mdash;like
      the thoughts that death is nothing, because it must come at last&mdash;to
      those who are in love with life! I have been always preserved from suicide&mdash;the
      last resource of the unfortunate, who prefer trusting in God to remaining
      amongst his creatures&mdash;by the sense of duty. One must not only think
      of self. And I reflected also&rsquo;God is good&mdash;always good&mdash;since
      the most wretched beings find opportunities for love and devotion.&rsquo;
      How is it that I, so weak and poor, have always found means to be helpful
      and useful to some one?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very day I felt tempted to make an end with life&mdash;Agricola
      and his mother had no longer need of me.&mdash;Yes, but the unfortunate
      creatures whom Mdlle. de Cardoville has commissioned me to watch over?&mdash;but
      my benefactress herself, though she has affectionately reproached me with
      the tenacity of my suspicions in regard to that man? I am more than ever
      alarmed for her&mdash;I feel that she is more than ever in danger&mdash;more
      than ever&mdash;I have faith in the value of my presence near her. Hence,
      I must live. Live&mdash;to go to-morrow to see this girl, whom Agricola
      passionately loves? Good heaven! why have I always known grief, and never
      hate? There must be a bitter pleasure in hating. So many people hate!&mdash;Perhaps
      I may hate this girl&mdash;Angela, as he called her, when he said, with so
      much simplicity: &lsquo;A charming name, is it not, Mother Bunch?&rsquo;
      Compare this name, which recalls an idea so full of grace, with the
      ironical symbol of my witch&rsquo;s deformity! Poor Agricola! poor
      brother! goodness is sometimes as blind as malice, I see. Should I hate
      this young girl?&mdash;Why? Did she deprive me of the beauty which charms
      Agricola? Can I find fault with her for being beautiful? When I was not
      yet accustomed to the consequences of my ugliness, I asked myself, with
      bitter curiosity, why the Creator had endowed his creatures so unequally.
      The habit of pain has allowed me to reflect calmly, and I have finished by
      persuading myself, that to beauty and ugliness are attached the two most
      noble emotions of the soul&mdash;admiration and compassion. Those who are
      like me admire beautiful persons&mdash;such as Angela, such as Agricola&mdash;and
      these in their turn feel a couching pity for such as I am. Sometimes, in
      spite of one&rsquo;s self, one has very foolish hopes. Because Agricola,
      from a feeling of propriety had never spoken to me of his love affairs, I
      sometimes persuaded myself that he had none&mdash;that he loved me, and
      that the fear of ridicule alone was with him, as with me, an obstacle in
      the way of confessing it. Yes, I have even made verses on that subject&mdash;and
      those, I think, not the worst I have written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is a singular position! If I love, I am ridiculous; if any
      love me, he is still more ridiculous. How did I come so to forget that, as
      to have suffered and to suffer what I do?&mdash;But blessed be that
      suffering, since it has not engendered hate&mdash;no; for I will not hate
      this girl&mdash;I will Perform a sister&rsquo;s part to the last; I will
      follow the guidance of my heart; I have the instinct of preserving others&mdash;my
      heart will lead and enlighten me. My only fear is, that I shall burst into
      tears when I see her, and not be able to conquer my emotion. Oh, then!
      what a revelation to Agricola&mdash;a discovery of the mad love he has
      inspired!&mdash;Oh, never! the day in which he knew that would be the last
      of my life. There would then be within me something stronger than duty&mdash;the
      longing to escape from shame&mdash;that incurable shame, that burns me
      like a hot iron. No, no; I will be calm. Besides, did I not just now, when
      with him bear courageously a terrible trial? I will be calm. My personal
      feelings must not darken the second sight, so clear for those I love. Oh!
      painful&mdash;painful task! for the fear of yielding involuntarily to evil
      sentiments must not render me too indulgent toward this girl. I might
      compromise Agricola&rsquo;s happiness, since my decision is to guide his
      choice. Poor creature that I am. How I deceive myself! Agricola asks my
      advice, because he thinks that I shall have not the melancholy courage to
      oppose his passion; or else he would say to me: &lsquo;No matter&mdash;I
      love; and I brave the future!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, if my advice, if the instincts of my heart, are not to
      guide him&mdash;if his resolution is taken beforehand&mdash;of what use
      will be to morrow&rsquo;s painful mission? Of what use? To obey him. Did
      he not say&mdash;&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; In thinking of my devotion for him,
      how many times, in the secret depths of my heart, I have asked myself if
      the thought had ever occurred to him to love me otherwise than as a
      sister; if it had ever struck him, what a devoted wife he would have in
      me! And why should it have occurred to him? As long as he wished, as long
      as he may still wish, I have been, and I shall be, as devoted to him, as
      if I were his wife, sister, or mother. Why should he desire what he
      already possesses?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married to him&mdash;oh, God!&mdash;the dream is mad as ineffable.
      Are not such thoughts of celestial sweetness&mdash;which include all
      sentiments from sisterly to maternal love&mdash;forbidden to me, on pain
      of ridicule as distressing as if I wore dresses and ornaments, that my
      ugliness and deformity would render absurd? I wonder, if I were now
      plunged into the most cruel distress, whether I should suffer as much as I
      do, on hearing of Agricola&rsquo;s intended marriage? Would hunger, cold,
      or misery diminish this dreadful dolor?&mdash;or is it the dread pain that
      would make me forget hunger, cold, and misery?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; this irony is bitter. It is not well in me to speak thus.
      Why such deep grief? In what way have the affection, the esteem, the
      respect of Agricola, changed towards me? I complain&mdash;but how would it
      be, kind heaven! if, as, alas! too often happens, I were beautiful,
      loving, devoted, and he had chosen another, less beautiful, less loving,
      less devoted?&mdash;Should I not be a thousand times more unhappy? for
      then I might, I would have to blame him&mdash;whilst now I can find no
      fault with him, for never having thought of a union which was impossible,
      because ridiculous. And had he wished it, could I ever have had the
      selfishness to consent to it? I began to write the first pages of this
      diary as I began these last, with my heart steeped in bitterness&mdash;and
      as I went on, committing to paper what I could have intrusted to no one,
      my soul grew calm, till resignation came&mdash;Resignation, my chosen
      saint, who, smiling through her tears, suffers and loves, but hopes&mdash;never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These word&rsquo;s were the last in the journal. It was clear, from the
      blots of abundant tears, that the unfortunate creature had often paused to
      weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, worn out by so many emotions, Mother Bunch late in the night,
      had replaced the book behind the cardboard box, not that she thought it
      safer there than elsewhere (she had no suspicion of the slightest need for
      such precaution), but because it was more out of the way there than in any
      of the drawers, which she frequently opened in presence of other people.
      Determined to perform her courageous promise, and worthily accomplish her
      task to the end, she waited the next day for Agricola, and firm in her
      heroic resolution, went with the smith to M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory.
      Florine, informed of her departure, but detained a portion of the day in
      attendance on Mdlle. de Cardoville preferred waiting for night to perform
      the new orders she had asked and received, since she had communicated by
      letter the contents of Mother Bunch&rsquo;s journal. Certain not to be
      surprised, she entered the workgirls&rsquo; chamber, as soon as the night
      was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing the place where she should find the manuscript, she went straight
      to the desk, took out the box, and then, drawing from her pocket a sealed
      letter, prepared to leave it in the place of the manuscript, which she was
      to carry away with her. So doing, she trembled so much, that she was
      obliged to support herself an instant by the table. Every good sentiment
      was not extinct in Florine&rsquo;s heart; she obeyed passively the orders
      she received, but she felt painfully how horrible and infamous was her
      conduct. If only herself had been concerned, she would no doubt have had
      the courage to risk all, rather than submit to this odious despotism; but
      unfortunately, it was not so, and her ruin would have caused the mortal
      despair of another person whom she loved better than life itself. She
      resigned herself, therefore, not without cruel anguish, to abominable
      treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she hardly ever knew for what end she acted, and this was
      particularly the case with regard to the abstraction of the journal, she
      foresaw vaguely, that the substitution of this sealed letter for the
      manuscript would have fatal consequences for Mother Bunch, for she
      remembered Rodin&rsquo;s declaration, that &ldquo;it was time to finish
      with the young sempstress.&rdquo;

    <p>
      What did he mean by those words? How would the letter that she was charged
      to put in the place of the diary, contribute to bring about this result?
      she did not know&mdash;but she understood that the clear-sighted devotion
      of the hunchback justly alarmed the enemies of Mdlle. de Cardoville, and
      that she (Florine) herself daily risked having her perfidy detected by the
      young needlewoman. This last fear put an end to the hesitations of
      Florine; she placed the letter behind the box, and, hiding the manuscript
      under her apron, cautiously withdrew from the chamber.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>eturned into her
      own room, some hours after she had concealed there the manuscript
      abstracted from Mother Bunch&rsquo;s apartment, Florine yielded to her
      curiosity, and determined to look through it. She soon felt a growing
      interest, an involuntary emotion, as she read more of these private
      thoughts of the young sempstress. Among many pieces of verse, which all
      breathed a passionate love for Agricola&mdash;a love so deep, simple, and
      sincere, that Florine was touched by it, and forgot the author&rsquo;s
      deformity&mdash;among many pieces of verse, we say, were divers other
      fragments, thoughts, and narratives, relating to a variety of facts. We
      shall quote some of them, in order to explain the profound impression that
      their perusal made upon Florine.

      Fragments from the Diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my birthday. Until this evening, I had cherished a foolish
      hope. Yesterday, I went down to Mrs. Baudoin&rsquo;s, to dress a little
      wound she had on her leg. When I entered the room, Agricola was there. No
      doubt he was talking of me to his mother, for they stopped when I came in,
      and exchanged a meaning smile. In passing by the drawers, I saw a
      pasteboard box, with a pincushion-lid, and I felt myself blushing with
      joy, as I thought this little present was destined for me, but I pretended
      not to see it. While I was on my knees before his mother, Agricola went
      out. I remarked that he took the little box with him. Never has Mrs.
      Baudoin been more tender and motherly than she was that morning. It
      appeared to me that she went to bed earlier than usual. &lsquo;It is to
      send me away sooner,&rsquo; said I to myself, &lsquo;that I may enjoy the
      surprise Agricola has prepared for me.&rsquo; How my heart beat, as I ran
      fast, very fast, up to my closet! I stopped a moment before opening the
      door, that my happiness might last the longer. At last I entered the room,
      my eyes swimming with tears of joy. I looked upon my table, my chair, my
      bed&mdash;there was nothing. The little box was not to be found. My heart
      sank within me. Then I said to myself: &lsquo;It will be to-morrow&mdash;this
      is only the eve of my birthday.&rsquo; The day is gone. Evening is come.
      Nothing. The pretty box was not for me. It had a pincushion-cover. It was
      only suited for a woman. To whom has Agricola given it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suffer a good deal just now. It was a childish idea that I
      connected with Agricola&rsquo;s wishing me many happy returns of the day.
      I am ashamed to confess it; but it might have proved to me, that he has
      not forgotten I have another name besides that of Mother Bunch, which they
      always apply to me. My susceptibility on this head is unfortunately so
      stubborn, that I cannot help feeling a momentary pang of mingled shame and
      sorrow, every time that I am called by that fairy-tale name, and yet I
      have had no other from infancy. It is for that very reason that I should
      have been so happy if Agricola had taken this opportunity to call me for
      once by my own humble name&mdash;Magdalen. Happily, he will never know
      these wishes and regrets!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeper and deeper touched by this page of simple grief, Florine turned
      over several leaves, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been to the funeral of poor little Victorine Herbin,
      our neighbor. Her father, a journeyman upholsterer, is gone to work by the
      month, far from Paris. She died at nineteen, without a relation near her.
      Her agony was not long. The good woman who attended her to the last, told
      us that she only pronounced these words: &lsquo;At last, oh at last!&rsquo;
      and that with an air of satisfaction, added the nurse. Dear child! she had
      become so pitiful. At fifteen, she was a rosebud&mdash;so pretty, so
      fresh-looking, with her light hair as soft as silk; but she wasted away by
      degrees&mdash;her trade of renovating mattresses killed her. She was
      slowly poisoned by the emanations from the wool.(26) They were all the
      worse, that she worked almost entirely for the poor, who have cheap stuff
      to lie upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had the courage of a lion, and an angel&rsquo;s resignation,
      She always said to me, in her low, faint voice, broken by a dry and
      frequent cough: &lsquo;I have not long to live, breathing, as I do, lime
      and vitriol all day long. I spit blood, and have spasms that make me
      faint.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why not change your trade?&rsquo; have I said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where will I find the time to make another apprenticeship?&rsquo;
      she would answer; &lsquo;and it is now too late. I feel that I am done
      for. It is not my fault,&rsquo; added the good creature, &lsquo;for I did
      not choose my employment. My father would have it so; luckily he can do
      without me. And then, you see, when one is dead, one cares for nothing,
      and has no fear of &ldquo;slop wages.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victorine uttered that sad, common phrase very sincerely, and with
      a sort of satisfaction. Therefore she died repeating: &lsquo;At last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is painful to think that the labor by which the poor man earns
      his daily bread, often becomes a long suicide! I said this the other day
      to Agricola; he answered me that there were many other fatal employments;
      those who prepare aquafortis, white lead, or minium, for instance, are
      sure to take incurable maladies of which they die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; added Agricola, &lsquo;what they say
      when they start for those fatal works?&rsquo;&mdash;Why, &lsquo;We are
      going to the slaughter-house.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That made me tremble with its terrible truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And all this takes place in our day,&rsquo; said I to him,
      with an aching heart; &lsquo;and it is well-known. And, out of so many of
      the rich and powerful, no one thinks of the mortality which decimates his
      brothers, thus forced to eat homicidal bread!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What can you expect, my poor sister,&rsquo; answered
      Agricola. &lsquo;When men are to be incorporated, that they may get killed
      in war, all pains are taken with them. But when they are to be organized,
      so as to live in peace, no one cares about it, except M. Hardy, my master.
      People say, &lsquo;Pooh! hunger, misery, and suffering of the laboring
      classes&mdash;what is that to us? that is not politics.&rsquo; &lsquo;They
      are wrong,&rsquo; added Agricola; &lsquo;IT IS MORE THAN POLITICS.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Victorine had not left anything to pay for the church service,
      there was only the presentation of the body under the porch; for there is
      not even a plain mass for the poor. Besides, as they could not give
      eighteen francs to the curate, no priest accompanied the pauper&rsquo;s
      coffin to the common grave. If funerals, thus abridged and cut short, are
      sufficient in a religious point of view, why invent other and longer
      forms? Is it from cupidity?&mdash;If, on the other hand, they are not
      sufficient, why make the poor man the only victim of this insufficiency?
      But why trouble ourselves about the pomp, the incense, the chants, of
      which they are either too sparing or too liberal? Of what use? and for
      what purpose? They are vain, terrestrial things, for which the soul recks
      nothing, when, radiant, it ascends towards its Creator. Yesterday,
      Agricola made me read an article in a newspaper, in which violent blame
      and bitter irony are by turns employed, to attack what they call the
      baneful tendencies of some of the lower orders, to improve themselves, to
      write, to read the poets, and sometimes to make verses. Material
      enjoyments are forbidden us by poverty. Is it humane to reproach us for
      seeking the enjoyments of the mind? What harm can it do any one if every
      evening, after a day&rsquo;s toil, remote from all pleasure, I amuse
      myself, unknown to all, in making a few verses, or in writing in this
      journal the good or bad impressions I have received? Is Agricola the worse
      workman, because, on returning home to his mother, he employs Sunday in
      composing some of those popular songs, which glorify the fruitful labors
      of the artisan, and say to all, Hope and brotherhood! Does he not make a
      more worthy use of his time than if he spent it in a tavern? Ah! those who
      blame us for these innocent and noble diversions, which relieve our
      painful toils and sufferings, deceive themselves when they think, that, in
      proportion as the intellect is raised and refined, it is more difficult to
      bear with privations and misery, and that so the irritation increases
      against the luckier few.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitting even this to be the case&mdash;and it is not so&mdash;is
      it not better to have an intelligent, enlightened enemy, to whose heart
      and reason you may address yourself, than a stupid, ferocious, implacable
      foe? But no; enmities disappear as the mind becomes enlightened, and the
      horizon of compassion extends itself. We thus learn to understand moral
      afflictions. We discover that the rich also have to suffer intense pains,
      and that brotherhood in misfortune is already a link of sympathy. Alas!
      they also have to mourn bitterly for idolized children, beloved
      mistresses, reverend mothers; with them, also, especially amongst the
      women, there are, in the height of luxury and grandeur, many broken
      hearts, many suffering souls, many tears shed in secret. Let them not be
      alarmed. By becoming their equals in intelligence, the people will learn
      to pity the rich, if good and unhappy&mdash;and to pity them still more if
      rejoicing in wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happiness! what a joyful day! I am giddy with delight. Oh,
      truly, man is good, humane, charitable. Oh, yes! the Creator has implanted
      within him every generous instinct&mdash;and, unless he be a monstrous
      exception, he never does evil willingly. Here is what I saw just now. I
      will not wait for the evening to write it down, for my heart would, as it
      were, have time to cool. I had gone to carry home some work that was
      wanted in a hurry. I was passing the Place du Temple. A few steps from me
      I saw a child, about twelve years old at most, with bare head, and feet,
      in spite of the severe weather, dressed in a shabby, ragged smock frock
      and trousers, leading by the bridle a large cart-horse, with his harness
      still on. From time to time the horse stopped short, and refused to
      advance. The child, who had no whip, tugged in vain at the bridle. The
      horse remained motionless. Then the poor little fellow cried out: &lsquo;O
      dear, O dear!&rsquo; and began to weep bitterly, looking round him as if
      to implore the assistance of the passers-by. His dear little face was
      impressed with so heart piercing a sorrow, that, without reflecting, I
      made an attempt at which I can now only smile, I must have presented so
      grotesque a figure. I am horribly afraid of horses, and I am still more
      afraid of exposing myself to public gaze. Nevertheless, I took courage,
      and, having an umbrella in my hand, I approached the horse, and with the
      impetuosity of an ant that strives to move a large stone with a little
      piece of straw, I struck with all my strength on the croup of the
      rebellious animal. &lsquo;Oh, thanks, my good lady!&rsquo; exclaimed the
      child, drying his eyes: &lsquo;hit him again, if you please. Perhaps he
      will get up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began again, heroically; but, alas! either from obstinacy or
      laziness, the horse bent his knees, and stretched himself out upon the
      ground; then, getting entangled with his harness, he tore it, and broke
      his great wooden collar. I had drawn back quickly, for fear of receiving a
      kick. Upon this new disaster, the child could only throw himself on his
      knees in the middle of the street, clasping his hands and sobbing, and
      exclaiming in a voice of despair: &lsquo;Help! help!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The call was heard; several of the passers-by gathered round, and a
      more efficacious correction than mine was administered to the restive
      horse, who rose in a vile state, and without harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My master will beat me,&rsquo; cried the poor child, as his
      tears redoubled; &lsquo;I am already two hours after time, for the horse
      would not go, and now he has broken his harness. My master will beat me,
      and turn me away. Oh dear! what will become of me! I have no father nor
      mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At these words, uttered with a heart-rending accent, a worthy old
      clothes-dealer of the Temple, who was amongst the spectators, exclaimed,
      with a kindly air: &lsquo;No father nor mother! Do not grieve so, my poor
      little fellow; the Temple can supply everything. We will mend the harness,
      and, if my gossips are like me, you shall not go away bareheaded or
      barefooted in such weather as this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This proposition was greeted with acclamation; they led away both
      horse and child; some were occupied in mending the harness, then one
      supplied a cap, another a pair of stockings, another some shoes, and
      another a good jacket; in a quarter of an hour the child was warmly clad,
      the harness repaired, and a tall lad of eighteen, brandishing a whip,
      which he cracked close to the horse&rsquo;s ears, by way of warning, said
      to the little boy, who, gazing first at his new clothes, and then at the
      good woman, believed himself the hero of a fairy-tale. &lsquo;Where does
      your governor live, little &lsquo;un?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On the Quai du Canal-Saint-Martin, sir,&rsquo; answered he,
      in a voice trembling with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;I will help you
      take home the horse, who will go well enough with me, and I will tell the
      master that the delay was no fault of your&rsquo;n. A balky horse ought
      not to be trusted to a child of your age.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment of setting out, the poor little fellow said timidly
      to the good dame, as he took off his cap to her: &lsquo;Will you let me
      kiss you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His eyes were full of tears of gratitude. There was heart in that
      child. This scene of popular charity gave me delightful emotions. As long
      as I could, I followed with my eyes the tall young man and the child, who
      now could hardly keep up with the pace of the horse, rendered suddenly
      docile by fear of the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I repeat it with pride; man is naturally good and helpful.
      Nothing could have been more spontaneous than this movement of pity and
      tenderness in the crowd, when the poor little fellow exclaimed: &lsquo;What
      will become of me? I have no father or mother!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Unfortunate child!&rsquo; said I to myself. &lsquo;No father
      nor mother. In the hands of a brutal master, who hardly covers him with a
      few rags, and ill treats him into the bargain. Sleeping, no doubt in the
      corner of a stable. Poor little, fellow! and yet so mild and good, in
      spite of misery and misfortune. I saw it&mdash;he was even more grateful
      than pleased at the service done him. But perhaps this good natural
      disposition, abandoned without support or counsel, or help, and
      exasperated by bad treatment, may become changed and embittered&mdash;and
      then will come the age of the passions&mdash;the bad temptations&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! in the deserted poor, virtue is doubly saintly and respectable!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, after having (as usual) gently reproached me for not
      going to mass, Agricola&rsquo;s mother said to me these words, so touching
      in her simple and believing mouth, &lsquo;Luckily, I pray for you and
      myself too, my poor girl; the good God will hear me, and you will only go,
      I hope, to Purgatory.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good mother; angelic soul! she spoke those words in so grave and
      mild a tone, with so strong a faith in the happy result of her pious
      intercession, that I felt my eyes become moist, and I threw myself on her
      neck, as sincerely grateful as if I had believed in Purgatory. This day
      has been a lucky one for me. I hope I have found work, which luck I shall
      owe to a young person full of heart and goodness, she is to take me
      to-morrow to St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent, where she thinks she can find me
      employment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Florine, already much moved by the reading, started at this passage in
      which Mother Bunch alluded to her, ere she continued as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never shall I forget with what touching interest, what delicate
      benevolence, this handsome young girl received me, so poor, and so
      unfortunate. It does not astonish me, for she is attached to the person of
      Mdlle. de Cardoville. She must be worthy to reside with Agricola&rsquo;s
      benefactress. It will always be dear and pleasant to me to remember her
      name. It is graceful and pretty as her face; it is Florine. I am nothing,
      I have nothing&mdash;but if the fervent prayers of a grateful heart might
      be heard, Mdlle. Florine would be happy, very happy. Alas! I am reduced to
      say prayers for her&mdash;only prayers&mdash;for I can do nothing but
      remember and love her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These lines, expressing so simply the sincere gratitude of the hunchback,
      gave the last blow to Florine&rsquo;s hesitations. She could no longer
      resist the generous temptation she felt. As she read these last fragments
      of the journal, her affection and respect for Mother Bunch made new
      progress. More than ever she felt how infamous it was in her to expose to
      sarcasms and contempt the most secret thoughts of this unfortunate
      creature. Happily, good is often as contagious as evil. Electrified by all
      that was warm, noble, and magnanimous in the pages she had just read,
      Florine bathed her failing virtue in that pure and vivifying source, and,
      yielding, at last to one of those good impulses which sometimes carried
      her away, she left the room with the manuscript in her hand, determined,
      if Mother Bunch had not yet returned, to replace it&mdash;resolved to tell
      Rodin that, this second time, her search for the journal had been vain,
      the sempstress having no doubt discovered the first attempt.

      &ldquo;Carding Mattresses.&mdash;The dust which flies out of the wool
      makes carding destructive to health in any case, but trade adulterations
      enhance the danger. In sticking sheep, the skin gets blood-spotted; it has

      it clings to the wool after the process. The dresser (female, most often)
      breathes in the fine dust, and, by lung and other complaints, is far from
      seldom deplorably situated; the majority sicken of it and give up the
      trade, while those who keep to it, at the very least, suffer with a

      boiled in dyes, etc., to burn and disguise such foreign bodies as straw.
      thorns, splinters, and even bits of skin, not worth picking out. The dust
      rising when a mass of this is beaten, makes as many ravages as the

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. THE DISCOVERY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> little while
      before Florine made up her mind to atone for her shameful breach of
      confidence, Mother Bunch had returned from the factory, after
      accomplishing to the end her painful task. After a long interview with
      Angela, struck, like Agricola, with the ingenuous grace, sense, and
      goodness, with which the young girl was endowed, Mother Bunch had the
      courageous frankness to advise the smith to enter into this marriage. The
      following scene took place whilst Florine, still occupied in reading the
      journal, had not yet taken the praiseworthy resolution of replacing it. It
      was ten o&rsquo;clock at night. The workgirl, returned to Cardoville
      House, had just entered her chamber. Worn out by so many emotions, she had
      thrown herself into a chair. The deepest silence reigned in the house. It
      was now and then interrupted by the soughing of a high wind, which raged
      without and shook the trees in the garden. A single candle lighted the
      room, which was papered with dark green. That peculiar tint, and the
      hunchback&rsquo;s black dress, increased her apparent paleness. Seated in
      an arm-chair by the side of the fire, with her head resting upon her
      bosom, her hands crossed upon her knees, the work-girl&rsquo;s countenance
      was melancholy and resigned; on it was visible the austere satisfaction
      which is felt by the consciousness of a duty well performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all those who, brought up in the merciless school of misfortune, no
      longer exaggerate the sentiment of sorrow, too familiar and assiduous a
      guest to be treated as a stranger, Mother Bunch was incapable of long
      yielding to idle regrets and vain despair, with regard to what was already
      past. Beyond doubt, the blow had been sudden, dreadful; doubtless it must
      leave a long and painful remembrance in the sufferer&rsquo;s soul; but it
      was soon to pass, as it were, into that chronic state of pain-durance,
      which had become almost an integral part of her life. And then this noble
      creature, so indulgent to fate, found still some consolations in the
      intensity of her bitter pain. She had been deeply touched by the marks of
      affection shown her by Angela, Agricola&rsquo;s intended: and she had felt
      a species of pride of the heart, in perceiving with what blind confidence,
      with what ineffable joy, the smith accepted the favorable presentiments
      which seemed to consecrate his happiness. Mother Bunch also said to
      herself: &ldquo;At least, henceforth I shall not be agitated by hopes, or
      rather by suppositions as ridiculous as they were senseless. Agricola&rsquo;s
      marriage puts a term to all the miserable reveries of my poor head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, she found a real and deep consolation in the certainty that she
      had been able to go through this terrible trial, and conceal from Agricola
      the love she felt for him. We know how formidable to this unfortunate
      being were those ideas of ridicule and shame, which she believed would
      attach to the discovery of her mad passion. After having remained for some
      time absorbed in thought, Mother Bunch rose, and advanced slowly towards
      the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only recompense,&rdquo; said she, as she prepared the materials
      for writing, &ldquo;will be to entrust the mute witness of my pains with
      this new grief. I shall at least have kept the promise that I made to
      myself. Believing, from the bottom of my soul, that this girl is able to
      make Agricola happy, I told him so with the utmost sincerity. One day, a
      long time hence, when I shall read over these pages, I shall perhaps find
      in that a compensation for all that I now suffer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she drew the box from the pigeon-hole. Not finding her
      manuscript, she uttered a cry of surprise; but, what was her alarm, when
      she perceived a letter to her address in the place of the journal! She
      became deadly pale; her knees trembled; she almost fainted away. But her
      increasing terror gave her a fictitious energy, and she had the strength
      to break the seal. A bank-note for five hundred francs fell from the
      letter on the table, and Mother Bunch read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&mdash;There is something so original and amusing in
      reading in your memoirs the story of your love for Agricola, that it is
      impossible to resist the pleasure of acquainting him with the extent of
      it, of which he is doubtless ignorant, but to which he cannot fail to show
      himself sensible. Advantage will be taken to forward it to a multitude of
      other persons, who might, perhaps, otherwise be unfortunately deprived of
      the amusing contents of your diary. Should copies and extracts not be
      sufficient, we will have it printed, as one cannot too much diffuse such
      things. Some will weep&mdash;others will laugh&mdash;what appears superb
      to one set of people, will seem ridiculous to another, such is life&mdash;but
      your journal will surely make a great sensation. As you are capable of
      wishing to avoid your triumph, and as you were only covered with rags when
      you were received, out of charity into this house, where you wish to
      figure as the great lady, which does not suit your shape for more reasons
      than one, we enclose in the present five hundred francs to pay for your
      day-book, and prevent your being without resources, in case you should be
      modest enough to shrink from the congratulations which await you, certain
      to overwhelm you by to-morrow, for, at this hour, your journal is already
      in circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your brethren,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A REAL MOTHER BUNCH.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The vulgar, mocking, and insolent tone of this letter, which was purposely
      written in the character of a jealous lackey, dissatisfied with the
      admission of the unfortunate creature into the house, had been calculated
      with infernal skill and was sure to produce the effect intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good heaven!&rdquo; were the only words the unfortunate girl
      could pronounce, in her stupor and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if we remember in what passionate terms she had expressed her love
      for her adopted brother, if we recall many passages of this manuscript, in
      which she revealed the painful wounds often inflicted on her by Agricola
      without knowing it, and if we consider how great was her terror of
      ridicule, we shall understand her mad despair on reading this infamous
      letter. Mother Bunch did not think for a moment of all the noble words and
      touching narratives contained in her journal. The one horrible idea which
      weighed down the troubled spirit of the unfortunate creature, was, that on
      the morrow Agricola, Mdlle. de Cardoville, and an insolent and mocking
      crowd, would be informed of this ridiculous love, which would, she
      imagined, crush her with shame and confusion. This new blow was so
      stunning, that the recipient staggered a moment beneath the unexpected
      shock. For some minutes, she remained completely inert and helpless; then,
      upon reflection, she suddenly felt conscious of a terrible necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hospitable mansion, where she had found a sure refuge after so many
      misfortunes, must be left for ever. The trembling timidity and sensitive
      delicacy of the poor creature did not permit her to remain a minute more
      in this dwelling, where the most secret recesses of her soul had been laid
      open, profaned, and exposed no doubt to sarcasm and contempt. She did not
      think of demanding justice and revenge from Mdlle. de Cardoville. To cause
      a ferment of trouble and irritation in this house, at the moment of
      quitting it, would have appeared to her ingratitude towards her
      benefactress. She did not seek to discover the author or the motive of
      this odious robbery and insulting letter. Why should she, resolved, as she
      was, to fly from the humiliations with which she was threatened? She had a
      vague notion (as indeed was intended), that this infamy might be the work
      of some of the servants, jealous of the affectionate deference shown her
      by Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;and this thought filled her with despair.
      Those pages&mdash;so painfully confidential, which she would not have
      ventured to impart to the most tender and indulgent mother, because,
      written as it were with her heart&rsquo;s blood, they painted with too
      cruel a fidelity the thousand secret wounds of her soul&mdash;those pages
      were to serve, perhaps served even now, for the jest and laughing-stock of
      the lackeys of the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The money which accompanied this letter, and the insulting way in which it
      was offered, rather tended to confirm her suspicions. It was intended that
      the fear of misery should not be the obstacle of her leaving the house.
      The workgirl&rsquo;s resolution was soon taken, with that calm and firm
      resignation which was familiar to her. She rose, with somewhat bright and
      haggard eyes, but without a tear in them. Since the day before, she had
      wept too much. With a trembling, icy hand, she wrote these words on a
      paper, which she left by the side of the bank-note: &ldquo;May Mdlle. de
      Cardoville be blessed for all that she has done for me, and forgive me for
      having left her house, where I can remain no longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having written this, Mother Bunch threw into the fire the infamous letter,
      which seemed to burn her hands. Then, taking a last look at her chamber,
      furnished so comfortably, she shuddered involuntarily as she thought of
      the misery that awaited her&mdash;a misery more frightful than that of
      which she had already been the victim, for Agricola&rsquo;s mother had
      departed with Gabriel, and the unfortunate girl could no longer, as
      formerly, be consoled in her distress by the almost maternal affection of
      Dagobert&rsquo;s wife. To live alone&mdash;quite alone&mdash;with the
      thought that her fatal passion for Agricola was laughed at by everybody,
      perhaps even by himself&mdash;such were the future prospects of the
      hunchback. This future terrified her&mdash;a dark desire crossed her mind&mdash;she
      shuddered, and an expression of bitter joy contracted her features.
      Resolved to go, she made some steps towards the door, when, in passing
      before the fireplace, she saw her own image in the glass, pale as death,
      and clothed in black; then it struck her that she wore a dress which did
      not belong to her, and she remembered a passage in the letter, which
      alluded to the rags she had on before she entered that house. &ldquo;True!&rdquo;
      said she, with a heart breaking smile, as she looked at her black
      garments; &ldquo;they would call me a thief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, taking her candle, she entered the little dressing room, and put on
      again the poor, old clothes, which she had preserved as a sort of pious
      remembrance of her misfortunes. Only at this instant did her tears flow
      abundantly. She wept&mdash;not in sorrow at resuming the garb of misery,
      but in gratitude; for all the comforts around her, to which she was about
      to bid an eternal adieu, recalled to her mind at every step the delicacy
      and goodness of Mdlle. de Cardoville: therefore, yielding to an almost
      involuntary impulse, after she had put on her poor, old clothes, she fell
      on her knees in the middle of the room, and, addressing herself in thought
      to Mdlle. de Cardoville, she exclaimed, in a voice broken by convulsive
      sobs: &ldquo;Adieu! oh, for ever, adieu!&mdash;You, that deigned to call
      me friend&mdash;and sister!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, she rose in alarm; she heard steps in the corridor, which led
      from the garden to one of the doors of her apartment, the other door
      opening into the parlor. It was Florine, who (alas! too late) was bringing
      back the manuscript. Alarmed at this noise of footsteps, and believing
      herself already the laughing-stock of the house. Mother Bunch rushed from
      the room, hastened across the parlor, gained the court-yard, and knocked
      at the window of the porter&rsquo;s lodge. The house-door opened, and
      immediately closed upon her. And so the workgirl left Cardoville House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne was thus deprived of a devoted, faithful, and vigilant guardian.
      Rodin was delivered from an active and sagacious antagonist, whom he had
      always, with good reason, feared. Having, as we have seen, guessed Mother
      Bunch&rsquo;s love for Agricola, and knowing her to be a poet, the Jesuit
      supposed, logically enough that she must have written secretly some verses
      inspired by this fatal and concealed passion. Hence the order given to
      Florine, to try and discover some written evidence of this love; hence
      this letter, so horribly effective in its coarse ribaldry, of which, it
      must be observed, Florine did not know the contents, having received it
      after communicating a summary of the contents of the manuscript, which,
      the first time, she had only glanced through without taking it away. We
      have said, that Florine, yielding too late to a generous repentance, had
      reached Mother Bunch&rsquo;s apartment, just as the latter quitted the
      house in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving a light in the dressing-room, the waiting-maid hastened
      thither. She saw upon a chair the black dress that Mother Bunch had just
      taken off, and, a few steps further, the shabby little trunk, open and
      empty, in which she had hitherto preserved her poor garments. Florine&rsquo;s
      heart sank within her; she ran to the secretary; the disorder of the
      card-board boxes, the note for five hundred francs left by the side of the
      two lines written to Mdlle. de Cardoville, all proved that her obedience
      to Rodin&rsquo;s orders had borne fatal fruit, and that Mother Bunch had
      quitted the house for ever. Finding the uselessness of her tardy
      resolution, Florine resigned herself with a sigh to the necessity of
      delivering the manuscript to Rodin. Then, forced by the fatality of her
      miserable position to console herself for evil by evil, she considered
      that the hunchback&rsquo;s departure would at least make her treachery
      less dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after these events, Adrienne received the following note from
      Rodin, in answer to a letter she had written him, to inform him of the
      work-girl&rsquo;s inexplicable departure:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR YOUNG LADY;&mdash;Obliged to set out this morning for the
      factory of the excellent M. Hardy, whither I am called by an affair of
      importance, it is impossible for me to pay you my humble respects. You ask
      me what I think of the disappearance of this poor girl? I really do not
      know. The future will, I doubt not, explain all to her advantage. Only,
      remember what I told you at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s, with regard to a
      certain society and its secret emissaries, with whom it has the art of
      surrounding those it wishes to keep a watch on. I accuse no one; but let
      us only recall facts. This poor girl accused me; and I am, as you know,
      the most faithful of your servants. She possessed nothing; and yet five
      hundred francs were found in her secretary. You loaded her with favors;
      and she leaves your house without even explaining the cause of this
      extraordinary flight. I draw no conclusion, my dear young lady; I am
      always unwilling to condemn without evidence; but reflect upon all this,
      and be on your guard, for you have perhaps escaped a great danger. Be more
      circumspect and suspicious than ever; such at least is the respectful
      advice of your most obedient, humble servant,
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      It was a Sunday morning the very day on which Mdlle. de Cardoville had
      received Rodin&rsquo;s letter with regard to Mother Bunch&rsquo;s
      disappearance. Two men were talking to together, seated at a table in one
      of the public houses in the little village of Villiers, situated at no
      great distance from Hardy&rsquo;s factory. The village was for the most
      part inhabited by quarrymen and stonecutters, employed in working the
      neighboring quarries. Nothing can be ruder and more laborious, and at the
      same time less adequately paid, than the work of this class of people.
      Therefore, as Agricola had told Mother Bunch, they drew painful
      comparisons between their condition, almost always miserable, and the
      comfort and comparative ease enjoyed by M. Hardy&rsquo;s workmen, thanks
      to his generous and intelligent management, and to the principles of
      association and community which he had put in practice amongst them.
      Misery and ignorance are always the cause of great evils. Misery is easily
      excited to anger, and ignorance soon yields to perfidious counsels. For a
      long time, the happiness of M. Hardy&rsquo;s workmen had been naturally
      envied, but not with a jealousy amounting to hatred. As soon, however, as
      the secret enemies of the manufacturer, uniting with his rival Baron
      Tripeaud, had an interest in changing this peaceful state of things&mdash;it
      changed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With diabolical skill and perseverance they succeeded in kindling the most
      evil passions. By means of chosen emissaries, they applied to those
      quarrymen and stonecutters of the neighborhood, whose bad conduct had
      aggravated their misery. Notorious for their turbulence, audacity, and
      energy, these men might exercise a dangerous influence on the majority of
      their companions, who were peaceful, laborious, and honest, but easily
      intimidated by violence. These turbulent leaders, previously embittered by
      misfortune, were soon impressed with an exaggerated idea of the happiness
      of M. Hardy&rsquo;s workmen, and excited to a jealous hatred of them. They
      went still further; the incendiary sermons of an abbe, a member of the
      Jesuits, who had come expressly from Paris to preach during Lent against
      M. Hardy, acted powerfully on the minds of the women, who filled the
      church, whilst their husbands were haunting the taverns. Profiting by the
      growing fear, which the approach of the Cholera then inspired, the
      preacher struck with terror these weak and credulous imaginations by
      pointing to M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory as a centre of corruption and
      damnation, capable of drawing down the vengeance of Heaven, and bringing
      the fatal scourge upon the country. Thus the men, already inflamed with
      envy, were still more excited by the incessant urgency of their wives,
      who, maddened by the abbe&rsquo;s sermons, poured their curses on that
      band of atheists, who might bring down so many misfortunes upon them and
      their children. Some bad characters, belonging to the factory of Baron
      Tripeaud, and paid by him (for it was a great interest the honorable
      manufacturer had in the ruin of M. Hardy), came to augment the general
      irritation, and to complete it by raising one of those alarming
      union-questions, which in our day have unfortunately caused so much
      bloodshed. Many of M. Hardy&rsquo;s workmen, before they entered his
      employ, had belonged to a society or union, called the Devourers; while
      many of the stonecutters in the neighboring quarries belonged to a society
      called the Wolves. Now, for a long time, an implacable rivalry had existed
      between the Wolves and Devourers, and brought about many sanguinary
      struggles, which are the more to be deplored, as, in some respects, the
      idea of these unions is excellent, being founded on the fruitful and
      mighty principle of association. But unfortunately, instead of embracing
      all trades in one fraternal communion, these unions break up the
      working-class into distinct and hostile societies, whose rivalry often
      leads to bloody collisions.(27) For the last week, the Wolves, excited by
      so many different importunities, burned to discover an occasion or a
      pretext to come to blows with the Devourers; but the latter, not
      frequenting the public-houses, and hardly leaving the factory during the
      week, had hitherto rendered such a meeting impossible, and the Wolves had
      been forced to wait for the Sunday with ferocious impatience.

    <p>
      Moreover, a great number of the quarrymen and stonecutters, being
      peaceable and hard-working people, had refused, though Wolves themselves
      to join this hostile manifestation against the Devourers of M. Hardy&rsquo;s
      factory; the leaders had been obliged to recruit their forces from the
      vagabonds and idlers of the barriers, whom the attraction of tumult and
      disorder had easily enlisted under the flag of the warlike Wolves. Such
      then was the dull fermentation, which agitated the little village of
      Villiers, whilst the two men of whom we have spoken were at table in the
      public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men had asked for a private room, that they might be alone. One of
      them was still young, and pretty well dressed. But the disorder in his
      clothes, his loose cravat, his shirt spotted with wine, his dishevelled
      hair, his look of fatigue, his marble complexion, his bloodshot eyes,
      announced that a night of debauch had preceded this morning; whilst his
      abrupt and heavy gesture, his hoarse voice, his look, sometimes brilliant,
      and sometimes stupid, proved that to the last fumes of the intoxication of
      the night before, were joined the first attacks of a new state of
      drunkenness. The companion of this man said to him, as he touched his
      glass with his own: &ldquo;Your health, my boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours!&rdquo; answered the young man; &ldquo;though you look to me
      like the devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&mdash;the devil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to know me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you repent that you ever knew me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that I was a prisoner at Sainte-Pelagie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I take you out of prison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you take me out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have a good heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very fond of me, perhaps&mdash;just as the butcher likes
      the ox that he drives to the slaughter-house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man does not pay a hundred thousand francs for another without a
      motive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a motive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? what do you want to do with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jolly companion that will spend his money like a man, and pass
      every night like the last. Good wine, good cheer, pretty girls, and gay
      songs. Is that such a bad trade?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had remained a moment without answering, the young man replied
      with a gloomy air: &ldquo;Why, on the eve of my leaving prison, did you
      attach this condition to my freedom, that I should write to my mistress to
      tell her that I would never see her again! Why did you exact this letter
      from me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sigh! what, are you still thinking of her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong. Your mistress is far from Paris by this time. I saw
      her get into the stage-coach, before I came to take you out of Sainte
      Pelagie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was stifled in that prison. To get out, I would have given
      my soul to the devil. You thought so, and therefore you came to me; only,
      instead of my soul, you took Cephyse from me. Poor Bacchanal-Queen! And
      why did you do it? Thousand thunders! Will you tell me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man as much attached to his mistress as you are is no longer a
      man. He wants energy, when the occasion requires.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What occasion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us drink!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me drink too much brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! look at me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what frightens me. It seems something devilish. A
      bottle of brandy does not even make you wink. You must have a stomach of
      iron and a head of marble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long travelled in Russia. There we drink to roast ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here to only warm. So&mdash;let&rsquo;s drink&mdash;but wine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! wine is fit for children. Brandy for men like us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, brandy; but it burns, and sets the head on fire, and
      then we see all the flames of hell!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I like to see you, hang it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you told me that I was too much attached to my mistress,
      and that I should want energy when the occasion required, of what occasion
      did you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us drink!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a moment, comrade. I am no more of a fool than others. Your
      half words have taught me something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I have been a workman, that I have many companions,
      and that, being a good fellow, I am much liked amongst them. You want me
      for a catspaw, to catch other chestnuts?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be some getter-up of riots&mdash;some speculator in
      revolts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are travelling for some anonymous society, that trades in
      musket shots.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a coward?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I burned powder in July, I can tell you&mdash;make no mistakes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not mind burning some again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as well that sort of fireworks as any other. Only I find
      revolutions more agreeable than useful; all that I got from the barricades
      of the three days was burnt breeches and a lost jacket. All the cause won
      by me, with its &lsquo;Forward! March!&rsquo; says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know many of Hardy&rsquo;s workmen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s why you have brought me down here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you will meet with many of the workmen from the factory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men from Hardy&rsquo;s take part in a row? No, no; they are too
      well off for that. You have been sold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see presently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you they are well off. What have they to complain of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of their brethren&mdash;those who have not so good a master,
      and die of hunger and misery, and call on them for assistance? Do you
      think they will remain deaf to such a summons? Hardy is only an exception.
      Let the people but give a good pull all together, and the exception will
      become the rule, and all the world be happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say there is true, but it would be a devil of a pull that
      would make an honest man out of my old master, Baron Tripeaud, who made me
      what I am&mdash;an out-and-out rip.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardy&rsquo;s workmen are coming; you are their comrade, and have
      no interest in deceiving them. They will believe you. Join with me in
      persuading them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leave this factory, in which they grow effeminate and selfish,
      and forget their brothers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if they leave the factory, how are they to live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will provide for that&mdash;on the great day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s to be done till then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you have done last night&mdash;drink, laugh, sing, and, by way
      of work, exercise themselves privately in the use of arms.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will bring these workmen here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one has already spoken to them. They have had printed papers,
      reproaching them with indifference to their brothers. Come, will you
      support me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll support you&mdash;the more readily as I cannot very well
      support myself. I only cared for Cephyse in the world; I know that I am on
      a bad road; you are pushing me on further; let the ball roll!&mdash;Whether
      we go to the devil one way or the other is not of much consequence. Let&rsquo;s
      drink.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink to our next night&rsquo;s fun; the last was only
      apprenticeship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what then are you made? I looked at you, and never saw you
      either blush or smile, or change countenance. You are like a man of iron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a lad of fifteen. It would take something more to make me
      laugh. I shall laugh to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the brandy; but, devil take me, if
      you don&rsquo;t frighten me when you say you shall laugh tonight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the young man rose, staggering; he began to be once more
      intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; The host made his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a young man below, who calls himself Olivier. He asks
      for M. Morok.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Let him came up.&rdquo; The host went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of our men, but he is alone,&rdquo; said Morok, whose
      savage countenance expressed disappointment. &ldquo;It astonishes me, for
      I expected a good number. Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olivier? Yes&mdash;a fair chap, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see him directly. Here he is.&rdquo; A young man, with an
      open, bold, intelligent countenance, at this moment entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! old Sleepinbuff!&rdquo; he exclaimed, at sight of Morok&rsquo;s
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself. I have not seen you for an age, Olivier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough, my boy. We do not work at the same place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are alone!&rdquo; cried Morok; and pointing to Sleepinbuff,
      he added: &ldquo;You may speak before him&mdash;he is one of us. But why
      are you alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come alone, but in the name of my comrades.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Morok, with a sigh of satisfaction, &ldquo;they
      consent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They refuse&mdash;just as I do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the devil! they refuse? Have they no more courage than women?&rdquo;
      cried Morok, grinding his teeth with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark ye,&rdquo; answered Olivier, coolly. &ldquo;We have received
      your letters, and seen your agent. We have had proof that he is really
      connected with great societies, many members of which are known to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! why do you hesitate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, nothing proves that these societies are ready to make
      a movement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;tells you&mdash;they are,&rdquo; said Sleepinbuff,
      stammering &ldquo;and I (hic!) affirm it. Forward! March!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not enough,&rdquo; replied Olivier. &ldquo;Besides, we
      have reflected upon it. For a week the factory was divided. Even yesterday
      the discussion was too warm to be pleasant. But this morning Father Simon
      called to him; we explained ourselves fully before him, and he brought us
      all to one mind. We mean to wait, and if any disturbance breaks out, we
      shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your final word?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our last word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Sleepinbuff, suddenly, as he listened,
      balancing himself on his tottering legs. &ldquo;It is like the noise of a
      crowd not far off.&rdquo; A dull sound was indeed audible, which became
      every moment more and more distinct, and at length grew formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Olivier, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; replied Morok, smiling with a sinister air, &ldquo;I
      remember the host told me there was a great ferment in the village against
      the factory. If you and your other comrades had separated from Hardy&rsquo;s
      other workmen, as I hoped, these people who are beginning to howl would
      have been for you, instead of against you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was a trap, then, to set one half of M. Hardy&rsquo;s workmen
      against the other!&rdquo; cried Olivier; &ldquo;you hoped that we should
      make common cause with these people against the factory, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man had not time to finish. A terrible outburst of shouts,
      howls, and hisses shook the tavern. At the same instant the door was
      abruptly opened, and the host, pale and trembling, hurried into the
      chamber, exclaiming: &ldquo;Gentlemen! do any of you work at M. Hardy&rsquo;s
      factory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Olivier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are lost. Here are the Wolves in a body, saying there are
      Devourers here from M. Hardy&rsquo;s, and offering them battle&mdash;unless
      the Devourers will give up the factory, and range themselves on their
      side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a trap, there can be no doubt of it!&rdquo; cried Olivier,
      looking at Morok and Sleepinbuff, with a threatening air; &ldquo;if my
      mates had come, we were all to be let in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lay a trap, Olivier?&rdquo; stammered Jacques Rennepont. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Battle to the Devourers! or let them join the Wolves!&rdquo; cried
      the angry crowd with one voice, as they appeared to invade the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; exclaimed the host. Without giving Olivier time to
      answer, he seized him by the arm, and opening a window which led to a roof
      at no very great height from the ground, he said to him: &ldquo;Make your
      escape by this window, let yourself slide down, and gain the fields; it is
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20469.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      As the young workman hesitated, the host added, with a look of terror:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, against a couple of hundred, what can you do? A minute more,
      and you are lost. Do you not hear them? They have entered the yard; they
      are coming up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, at this moment, the groans, the hisses, and cheers redoubled in
      violence; the wooden staircase which led to the first story shook beneath
      the quick steps of many persons, and the shout arose, loud and piercing:
      &ldquo;Battle to the Devourers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly, Olivier!&rdquo; cried Sleepinbuff, almost sobered by the
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he pronounced the words when the door of the large room, which
      communicated with the small one in which they were, was burst open with a
      frightful crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; cried the host, clasping his hands in alarm.
      Then, running to Olivier, he pushed him, as it were, out of the window;
      for, with one foot on the sill, the workman still hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window once closed, the publican returned towards Morok the instant
      the latter entered the large room, into which the leaders of the Wolves
      had just forced an entry, whilst their companions were vociferating in the
      yard and on the staircase. Eight or ten of these madmen, urged by others
      to take part in these scenes of disorder, had rushed first into the room,
      with countenances inflamed by wine and anger; most of them were armed with
      long sticks. A blaster, of Herculean strength and stature, with an old red
      handkerchief about his head, its ragged ends streaming over his shoulders,
      miserably dressed in a half-worn goat-skin, brandished an iron
      drilling-rod, and appeared to direct the movements. With bloodshot eyes,
      threatening and ferocious countenance, he advanced towards the small room,
      as if to drive back Morok, and exclaimed, in a voice of thunder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the Devourers?&mdash;the Wolves will eat &lsquo;em up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The host hastened to open the door of the small room, saying: &ldquo;There
      is no one here, my friends&mdash;no one. Look for yourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the quarryman, surprised, after peeping
      into the room; &ldquo;where are they, then? We were told there were a
      dozen of them here. They should have marched with us against the factory,
      or there&rsquo;d &lsquo;a been a battle, and the Wolves would have tried
      their teeth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they have not come,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;they will come.
      Let&rsquo;s wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; we will wait for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will look close at each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Wolves want to see the Devourers,&rdquo; said Morok, &ldquo;why
      not go and howl round the factory of the miscreant atheists? At the first
      howl of the Wolves they will come out, and give you battle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will give you&mdash;battle,&rdquo; repeated Sleepinbuff,
      mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless the Wolves are afraid of the Devourers,&rdquo; added Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you talk of fear, you shall go with us, and see who&rsquo;s
      afraid!&rdquo; cried the formidable blaster, and in a thundering voice, he
      advanced towards Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of voices joined in with, &ldquo;Who says the Wolves are afraid
      of the Devourers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the first time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Battle! battle! and make an end of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are tired of all this. Why should we be so miserable, and they
      so well off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have said that quarrymen are brutes, only fit to torn wheels
      in a shaft, like dogs to turn spits,&rdquo; cried an emissary of Baron
      Tripeaud&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that the Devourers would make themselves caps with wolf-skin,&rdquo;
      added another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither they nor their wives ever go to mass. They are pagans and
      dogs!&rdquo; cried an emissary of the preaching abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men might keep their Sunday as they pleased; but their wives
      not to go to mass!&mdash;it is abominable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, therefore, the curate has said that their factory, because of
      its abominations, might bring down the cholera to the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True? he said that in his sermon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our wives heard it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; down with the Devourers, who want to bring the cholera on
      the country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray, for a fight!&rdquo; cried the crowd in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the factory, my brave Wolves!&rdquo; cried Morok, with the voice
      of a Stentor; &ldquo;on to the factory!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! to the factory! to the factory!&rdquo; repeated the crowd,
      with furious stamping; for, little by little, all who could force their
      way into the room, or up the stairs, had there collected together.
    </p>
    <p>
      These furious cries recalling Jacques for a moment to his senses, he
      whispered to Morok: &ldquo;It is slaughter you would provoke? I wash my
      hands of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have time to let them know at the factory. We can give
      these fellows the slip on the road,&rdquo; answered Morok. Then he cried
      aloud, addressing the host, who was terrified at this disorder: &ldquo;Brandy!&mdash;let
      us drink to the health of the brave Wolves! I will stand treat.&rdquo; He
      threw some money to the host, who disappeared, and soon returned with
      several bottles of brandy, and some glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! glasses?&rdquo; cried Morok. &ldquo;Do jolly companions, like
      we are, drink out of glasses?&rdquo; So saying, he forced out one of the
      corks, raised the neck of the bottle to his lips, and, having drunk a deep
      draught, passed it to the gigantic quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing!&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      in honor of the treat!&mdash;None but a sneak will refuse, for this stuff
      will sharpen the Wolves&rsquo; teeth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to your health, mates!&rdquo; said Morok, distributing
      the bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be blood at the end of all this,&rdquo; muttered
      Sleepinbuff, who, in spite of his intoxication, perceived all the danger
      of these fatal incitements. Indeed, a large portion of the crowd was
      already quitting the yard of the public-house, and advancing rapidly
      towards M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those of the workmen and inhabitants of the village, who had not chosen to
      take any part in this movement of hostility (they were the majority), did
      not make their appearance, as this threatening troop passed along the
      principal street; but a good number of women, excited to fanaticism by the
      sermons of the abbe, encouraged the warlike assemblage with their cries.
      At the head of the troop advanced the gigantic blaster, brandishing his
      formidable bar, followed by a motley mass, armed with sticks and stones.
      Their heads still warmed by their recent libations of brandy, they had now
      attained a frightful state of frenzy. Their countenances were ferocious,
      inflamed, terrible. This unchaining of the worst passions seemed to
      forbode the most deplorable consequences. Holding each other arm-in-arm,
      and walking four or five together, the Wolves gave vent to their
      excitement in war-songs, which closed with the following verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward! full of assurance! Let us try our vigorous arms! They have
      wearied out our prudence; Let us show we&rsquo;ve no alarms. Sprung from a
      monarch glorious,(28) To-day we&rsquo;ll not grow pale, Whether we win the
      fight, or fail, Whether we die, or are victorious! Children of Solomon,
      mighty king, All your efforts together bring, Till in triumph we shall
      sing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok and Jacques had disappeared whilst the tumultuous troop were leaving
      the tavern to hasten to the factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      (27) Let it be noted, to the working-man&rsquo;s credit, that such
      outrageous scenes become more and more rare as he is enlightened to the
      full consciousness of his worth. Such better tendencies are to be
      attributed to the just influence of an excellent tract on trades&rsquo;
      union written by M. Agricole Perdignier, and published in 1841, Paris.
      This author, a joiner, founded at his own expense an establishment in the
      Faubourg St. Antoine, where some forty or fifty of his trade lodged, and
      were given, after the day&rsquo;s work, a course of geometry, etc.,
      applied to wood carving. We went to one of the lectures, and found as much
      clearness in the professor as attention and intelligence in the audience.
      At ten, after reading selections, all the lodgers retire, forced by their
      scanty wages to sleep, perhaps, four in a room. M. Perdignier informed us
      that study and instruction were such powerful ameliorators, that, during
      six years, he had only one of his lodgers to expel. &ldquo;In a few days,&rdquo;
      he remarked, &ldquo;the bad eggs find out, this is no place for them to
      addle sound ones!&rdquo; We are happy to hear, reader, public homage to a
      learned and upright man, devoted to his fellow-workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      (28) The Wolves (among others) ascribe the institution of their company to
      King Solomon. See the curious work by M. Agricole Perdignier, from which
      the war-song is extracted.

      CHAPTER L. THE COMMON DWELLING-HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hilst the Wolves,
      as we have just seen, prepared a savage attack on the Devourers, the
      factory of M. Hardy had that morning a festal air, perfectly in accordance
      with the serenity of the sky; for the wind was from the north, and pretty
      sharp for a fine day in March. The clock had just struck nine in the
      Common Dwelling-house of the workmen, separated from the workshops by a
      broad path planted with trees. The rising sun bathed in light this
      imposing mass of buildings, situated a league from Paris, in a gay and
      salubrious locality, from which were visible the woody and picturesque
      hills, that on this side overlook the great city. Nothing could be
      plainer, and yet more cheerful than the aspect of the Common
      Dwelling-house of the workmen. Its slanting roof of red tiles projected
      over white walls, divided here and there by broad rows of bricks, which
      contrasted agreeably with the green color of the blinds on the first and
      second stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      These buildings, open to the south and east, were surrounded by a large
      garden of about ten acres, partly planted with trees, and partly laid out
      in fruit and kitchen-garden. Before continuing this description, which
      perhaps will appear a little like a fairy-tale, let us begin by saying,
      that the wonders, of which we are about to present the sketch, must not to
      be considered Utopian dreams; nothing, on the contrary, could be of a more
      positive character, and we are able to assert, and even to prove (what in
      our time is of great weight and interest), that these wonders were the
      result of an excellent speculation, and represented an investment as
      lucrative as it was secure. To undertake a vast, noble, and most useful
      enterprise; to bestow on a considerable number of human creatures an ideal
      prosperity, compared with the frightful, almost homicidal doom, to which
      they are generally condemned; to instruct them, and elevate them in their
      own esteem; to make them prefer to the coarse pleasures of the tavern, or
      rather to the fatal oblivion which they find there, as an escape from the
      consciousness of their deplorable destiny, the pleasures, of the intellect
      and the enjoyments of art; in a word, to make men moral by making them
      happy, and finally, thanks to this generous example, so easy of imitation,
      to take a place amongst the benefactors of humanity&mdash;and yet, at the
      same time to do, as it were, without knowing it, an excellent stroke of
      business&mdash;may appear fabulous. And yet this was the secret of the
      wonders of which we speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us enter the interior of the factory. Ignorant of Mother Bunch&rsquo;s
      cruel disappearance, Agricola gave himself up to the most happy, thoughts
      as he recalled Angela&rsquo;s image, and, having finished dressing with
      unusual care, went in search of his betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us say two words on the subject of the lodging, which the smith
      occupied in the Common Dwelling-house, at the incredibly low rate of
      seventy-five francs per annum like the other bachelors on the
      establishment. This lodging, situated on the second story, was comprised
      of a capital chamber and bedroom, with a southern aspect, and looking on
      the garden; the pine floor was perfectly white and clean; the iron
      bedstead was supplied with a good mattress and warm coverings; a gas
      burner and a warm-air pipe were also introduced into the rooms, to furnish
      light and heat as required; the walls were hung with pretty fancy
      papering, and had curtains to match; a chest of drawers, a walnut table, a
      few chairs, a small library, comprised Agricola&rsquo;s furniture.
      Finally, in the large and light closet, was a place for his clothes, a
      dressing table, and large zinc basin, with an ample supply of water. If we
      compare this agreeable, salubrious, comfortable lodging, with the dark,
      icy, dilapidated garret, for which the worthy fellow paid ninety francs at
      his mother&rsquo;s, and to get to which he had more than a league and a
      half to go every evening, we shall understand the sacrifice he made to his
      affection for that excellent woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola, after casting a last glance of tolerable satisfaction at his
      looking-glass, while he combed his moustache and imperial, quitted his
      chamber, to go and join Angela in the women&rsquo;s workroom. The
      corridor, along which he had to pass, was broad, well-lighted from above,
      floored with pine, and extremely clean. Notwithstanding some seeds of
      discord which had been lately sown by M. Hardy&rsquo;s enemies amongst his
      workmen, until now so fraternally united, joyous songs were heard in
      almost all the apartments which skirted the corridor, and, as Agricola
      passed before several open doors, he exchanged a cordial good-morrow with
      many of his comrades. The smith hastily descended the stairs, crossed the
      court yard, in which was a grass-plot planted with trees, with a fountain
      in the centre, and gained the other wing of the building. There was the
      workroom, in which a portion of the wives and daughters of the associated
      artisans, who happened not to be employed in the factory, occupied
      themselves in making up the linen. This labor, joined to the enormous
      saving effected by the purchase of the materials wholesale, reduced to an
      incredible extent the price of each article. After passing through this
      workroom, a vast apartment looking on the garden, well-aired in
      summer,(29) and well-warmed in winter, Agricola knocked at the door of the
      rooms occupied by Angela&rsquo;s mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we say a few words with regard to this lodging, situated on the first
      story, with an eastern aspect, and also looking on the garden, it is that
      we may tape it as a specimen of the habitation of a family in this
      association, supplied at the incredibly small price of one hundred and
      twenty-five francs per annum.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small entrance, opening on the corridor, led to a large room, on each
      side of which was a smaller chamber, destined for the family, when the
      boys and girls were too big to continue to sleep in the two dormitories,
      arranged after the fashion of a large school, and reserved for the
      children of both sexes. Every night the superintendence of these
      dormitories was entrusted to a father and mother of a family, belonging to
      the association. The lodging of which we speak, being, like all the
      others, disencumbered of the paraphernalia of a kitchen&mdash;for the
      cooking was done in common, and on a large scale, in another part of the
      building&mdash;was kept extremely clean. A pretty large piece of carpet, a
      comfortable arm-chair, some pretty-looking china on a stand of well
      polished wood, some prints hung against the walls, a clock of gilt bronze,
      a bed, a chest of drawers, and a mahogany secretary, announced that the
      inhabitants of this apartment enjoyed not only the necessaries, but some
      of the luxuries of life. Angela, who, from this time, might be called
      Agricola&rsquo;s betrothed, justified in every point the flattering
      portrait which the smith had drawn of her in his interview with poor
      Mother Bunch. The charming girl, seventeen years of age at most, dressed
      with as much simplicity as neatness, was seated by the side of her mother.
      When Agricola entered, she blushed slightly at seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;I have come to keep my
      promise, if your mother has no objection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, M. Agricola,&rdquo; answered the mother of the young
      girl cordially. &ldquo;She would not go over the Common Dwelling-house
      with her father, her brother, or me, because she wished to have that
      pleasure with you today. It is quite right that you, who can talk so well,
      should do the honors of the house to the new-comer. She has been waiting
      for you an hour, and with such impatience!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Agricola, gayly; &ldquo;in
      thinking of the pleasure of seeing you, I forgot the hour. That is my only
      excuse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; said the young girl, in a tone of mild reproach,
      and becoming red as a cherry, &ldquo;why did you say that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, yes or no? I do not blame you for it; on the contrary.
      Go with M. Agricola, child, and he will tell you, better than I can, what
      all the workmen of the factory owe to M, Hardy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Agricola,&rdquo; said Angela, tying the ribbons of her pretty
      cap, &ldquo;what a pity that your good little adopted sister is not with
      us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Bunch?&mdash;yes, you are right, mademoiselle; but that is
      only a pleasure put off, and the visit she paid us yesterday will not be
      the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having embraced her mother, the girl took Agricola&rsquo;s arm, and they
      went out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, M. Agricola,&rdquo; said Angela; &ldquo;if you knew how
      much I was surprised on entering this fine house, after being accustomed
      to see so much misery amongst the poor workmen in our country, and in
      which I too have had my share, whilst here everybody seems happy and
      contented. It is really like fairy-land; I think I am in a dream, and when
      I ask my mother the explanation of these wonders, she tells me, &lsquo;M.
      Agricola will explain it all to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I am so happy to undertake that delightful task,
      mademoiselle?&rdquo; said Agricola, with an accent at once grave and
      tender. &ldquo;Nothing could be more in season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, M. Agricola?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, to show you this house, to make you acquainted with all
      the resources of our association, is to be able to say to you: &lsquo;Here,
      the workman, sure of the present, sure of the future, is not, like so many
      of his poor brothers, obliged to renounce the sweetest want of the heart&mdash;the
      desire of choosing a companion for life&mdash;in the fear of uniting
      misery to misery.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Angela cast down her eyes, and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here the workman may safely yield to the hope of knowing the sweet
      joys of a family, sure of not having his heart torn hereafter by the sight
      of the horrible privations of those who are dear to him; here, thanks to
      order and industry, and the wise employment of the strength of all, men,
      women, and children live happy and contented. In a ward, to explain all
      this to you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; added Agricola, smiling with a still
      more tender air, &ldquo;is to prove, that here we can do nothing more
      reasonable than love, nothing wiser than marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Agricola,&rdquo; answered Angela, in a slightly agitated voice,
      and blushing still more as she spoke, &ldquo;suppose we were to begin our
      walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied the smith, pleased at the
      trouble he had excited in that ingenuous soul. &ldquo;But, come; we are
      near the dormitory of the little girls. The chirping birds have long left
      their nests. Let us go there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20477.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The young smith and Angela soon entered a spacious dormitory, resembling
      that of a first-rate boarding school. The little iron bedsteads were
      arranged in symmetrical order; at each end were the beds of the two
      mothers of families, who took the superintendence by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! how well it is arranged, M. Agricola, and how neat and
      clean! Who is it that takes such good care of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children themselves; we have no servants here. There is an
      extraordinary emulation between these urchins&mdash;as to who shall make
      her bed most neatly, and it amuses them quite as much as making a bed for
      their dolls. Little girls, you know, delight in playing at keeping house.
      Well, here they play at it in good earnest, and the house is admirably
      kept in consequence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I understand. They turn to account their natural taste for all
      such kinds of amusement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the whole secret. You will see them everywhere usefully
      occupied, and delighted at the importance of the employments given them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Agricola!&rdquo; said Angela, timidly, &ldquo;only compare
      these fine dormitories, so warm and healthy, with the horrible icy
      garrets, where children are heaped pell-mell on a wretched straw-mattress,
      shivering with cold, as in the case with almost all the workmen&rsquo;s
      families in our country!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in Paris, mademoiselle, it is even worse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how kind, generous, and rich must M. Hardy be, to spend so much
      money in doing good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to astonish you, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said Agricola,
      with a smile; &ldquo;to astonish you so much, that perhaps you will not
      believe me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so, M. Agricola?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not certainly in the world a man with a better and more
      generous heart than M. Hardy; he does good for its own sake and without
      thinking of his personal interest. And yet, Mdlle. Angela, were he the
      most selfish and avaricious of men, he would still find it greatly to his
      advantage to put us in a position to be as comfortable as we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, M. Agricola? You tell me so, and I believe it; but
      if good can so easily be done, if there is even an advantage in doing it,
      why is it not more commonly attempted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mademoiselle, it requires three gifts very rarely met with in
      the same person&mdash;knowledge, power and will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! yes. Those who have the knowledge, have not the power.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those who have the power, have neither the knowledge nor the
      will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does M. Hardy find any advantage in the good he does for
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain that presently, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a nice, sweet smell of fruit!&rdquo; said Angela,
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our common fruit-store is close at hand. I wager we shall find
      there some of the little birds from the dormitory&mdash;not occupied in
      picking and stealing, but hard at work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening a door, Agricola led Angela into a large room, furnished with
      shelves, on which the winter fruits were arranged in order. A number of
      children, from seven to eight years old, neatly and warmly clad, and
      glowing with health, exerted themselves cheerfully, under the
      superintendence of a woman, in separating and sorting the spoiled fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;wherever it is possible, we
      make use of the children. These occupations are amusements for them,
      answering to the need of movement and activity natural to their age; and,
      in this way, we can employ the grown girls and the women to much better
      advantage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, M. Agricola; how well it is all arranged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you saw what services the urchins in the kitchen render!
      Directed by one or two women, they do the work of eight or ten servants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Angela, smiling, &ldquo;at their age, we like
      so much to play at cooking dinner. They must be delighted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in the same way, under pretext of playing at gardening, they
      weed the ground, gather the fruit and vegetables, water the flowers, roll
      the paths, and so on. In a word, this army of infant-workers, who
      generally remain till ten or twelve years of age without being of any
      service, are here very useful. Except three hours of school, which is
      quite sufficient for them, from the age of six or seven their recreations
      are turned to good account, and the dear little creatures, by the saving
      of full-grown arms which they effect, actually gain more than they cost;
      and then, mademoiselle, do you not think there is something in the
      presence of childhood thus mixed up with every labor&mdash;something mild,
      pure, almost sacred, which has its influence on our words and actions, and
      imposes a salutary reserve? The coarsest man will respect the presence of
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more one reflects, the more one sees that everything here is
      really designed for the happiness of all!&rdquo; said Angela, in
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not been done without trouble. It was necessary to conquer
      prejudices, and break through customs. But see, Mdlle. Angela! here we are
      at the kitchen,&rdquo; added the smith, smiling; &ldquo;is it not as
      imposing as that of a barrack or a public school?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the culinary department of the Common Dwelling-house was immense.
      All its utensils were bright and clean; and thanks to the marvellous and
      economical inventions of modern science (which are always beyond the reach
      of the poorer classes, to whom they are most necessary, because they can
      only be practised on a large scale), not only the fire on the hearth, and
      in the stoves, was fed with half the quantity of fuel that would have been
      consumed by each family individually, but the excess of the caloric
      sufficed, with the aid of well-constructed tubes, to spread a mild and
      equal warmth through all parts of the house. And here also children, under
      the direction of two women, rendered numerous services. Nothing could be
      more comic than the serious manner in which they performed their culinary
      functions; it was the same with the assistance they gave in the bakehouse,
      where, at an extraordinary saving in the price (for they bought flour
      wholesale), they made an excellent household bread, composed of pure wheat
      and rye, so preferable to that whiter bread, which too often owes its
      apparent qualities to some deleterious substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Dame Bertrand,&rdquo; said Agricola, gayly, to a worthy
      matron, who was gravely contemplating the slow evolution of several spits,
      worthy of Gamache&rsquo;s Wedding so heavily were they laden with pieces
      of beef, mutton, and veal, which began to assume a fine golden brown color
      of the most attractive kind; &ldquo;good-day, Dame Bertrand. According to
      the rule, I do not pass the threshold of the kitchen. I only wish it to be
      admired by this young lady, who is a new-comer amongst us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admire, my lad, pray admire&mdash;and above all take notice, how
      good these brats are, and how well they work!&rdquo; So saying, the matron
      pointed with the long ladle, which served her as a sceptre, to some
      fifteen children of both sexes, seated round a table, and deeply absorbed
      in the exercise of their functions, which consisted in peeling potatoes
      and picking herbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, I see, to have a downright Belshazzar&rsquo;s feast, Dame
      Bertrand?&rdquo; said Agricola, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, a feast like we have always, my lad. Here is our bill of
      fare for to-day. A good vegetable soup, roast beef with potatoes, salad,
      fruit, cheese; and for extras, it being Sunday, some currant tarts made by
      Mother Denis at the bakehouse, where the oven is heating now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you tell me, Dame Bertrand, gives me a furious appetite,&rdquo;
      said Agricola, gayly. &ldquo;One soon knows when it is your turn in the
      kitchen,&rdquo; added he, with a flattering air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get along, do!&rdquo; said the female Soyer on service, merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What astonishes me, so much, M. Agricola,&rdquo; said Angela, as
      they continued their walk, &ldquo;is the comparison of the insufficient,
      unwholesome food of the workmen in our country, with that which is
      provided here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet we do not spend more than twenty-five sous a day, for much
      better food than we should get for three francs in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really it is hard to believe, M. Agricola. How is it possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thanks to the magic wand of M. Hardy. I will explain it all
      presently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how impatient I am to see M. Hardy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will soon see him&mdash;perhaps to-day; for he is expected
      every moment. But here is the refectory, which you do not yet know, as
      your family, like many others, prefer dining at home. See what a fine
      room, looking out on the garden, just opposite the fountain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a vast hall, built in the form of a gallery, with ten
      windows opening on the garden. Tables, covered with shining oil-cloth,
      were ranged along the walls, so that, in winter, this apartment served in
      the evening, after work, as a place of meeting for those who preferred to
      pass an hour together, instead of remaining alone or with their families.
      Then, in this large hall, well warmed and brilliantly lighted with gas,
      some read, some played cards, some talked, and some occupied themselves
      with easy work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not all,&rdquo; said Agricola to the young girl; &ldquo;I
      am sure you will like this apartment still better when I tell you, that on
      Thursdays and Sundays we make a ball-room of it, and on Tuesdays and
      Saturdays a concert-room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the smith, proudly, &ldquo;we have amongst us
      musicians, quite capable of tempting us to dance. Moreover, twice a week,
      nearly all of us sing in chorus&mdash;men, women, and children.
      Unfortunately, this week, some disputes that have arisen in the factory
      have prevented our concerts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So many voices! that must be superb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very fine, I assure you. M. Hardy has always encouraged this
      amusement amongst us, which has, he says&mdash;and he is right&mdash;so
      powerful an effect on the mind and the manners. One winter, he sent for
      two pupils of the celebrated Wilhelm, and, since then, our school has made
      great progress. I assure you, Mdlle. Angela, that, without flattering
      ourselves, there is something truly exciting in the sound of two hundred
      voices, singing in chorus some hymn to Labor or Freedom. You shall hear
      it, and you will, I think, acknowledge that there is something great and
      elevating in the heart of man, in this fraternal harmony of voices,
      blending in one grave, sonorous, imposing sound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I believe it. But what happiness to inhabit here. It is a life
      of joy; for labor, mixed with recreation, becomes itself a pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! here, as everywhere, there are tears and sorrows,&rdquo;
      replied Agricola, sadly. &ldquo;Do you see that isolated building, in a
      very exposed situation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is our hospital for the sick. Happily, thanks to our healthy
      mode of life, it is not often full; an annual subscription enables us to
      have a good doctor. Moreover, a mutual benefit society is arranged in such
      a manner amongst us, that any one of us, in case of illness, receives two
      thirds of what he would have gained in health.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well it is all managed! And there, M. Agricola, on the other
      side of the grass-plot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the wash-house, with water laid on, cold and hot; and under
      yonder shed is the drying-place: further on, you see the stables, and the
      lofts and granaries for the provender of the factory horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But M. Agricola, will you tell me the secret of all these wonders?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ten minutes you shall understand it all, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Angela&rsquo;s curiosity was for a while disappointed. The
      girl was now standing with Agricola close to the iron gate, which shut in
      the garden from the broad avenue that separated the factory from the
      Common Dwelling-house. Suddenly, the wind brought from the distance the
      sound of trumpets and military music; then was heard the gallop of two
      horses, approaching rapidly, and soon after a general officer made his
      appearance, mounted on a fine black charger, with a long flowing tail and
      crimson housings; he wore cavalry boots and white breeches, after the
      fashion of the empire; his uniform glittered with gold embroidery, the red
      ribbon of the Legion of Honor was passed over his right epaulet, with its
      four silver stars, and his hat had a broad gold border, and was crowned
      with a white plume, the distinctive sign reserved for the marshals of
      France. No warrior could have had a more martial and chivalrous air, or
      have sat more proudly on his war-horse. At the moment Marshal Simon (for
      it was he) arrived opposite the place where Angela and Agricola were
      standing, he drew up his horse suddenly, sprang lightly to the ground, and
      threw the golden reins to a servant in livery, who followed also on
      horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall I wait for your grace?&rdquo; asked the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of the avenue,&rdquo; said the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, uncovering his head respectfully, he advanced hastily with his hat in
      his hand, to meet a person whom Angela and Agricola had not previously
      perceived. This person soon appeared at a turn of the avenue; he was an
      old man, with an energetic, intelligent countenance. He wore a very neat
      blouse, and a cloth cap over his long, white hair. With his hands in his
      pocket, he was quietly smoking an old meerschaum pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, father,&rdquo; said the marshal, respectfully, as he
      affectionately embraced the old workman, who, having tenderly returned the
      pressure, said to him: &ldquo;Put on your hat, my boy. But how gay we are!&rdquo;
      added he, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been to a review, father, close by; and I took the
      opportunity to call on you as soon as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But shall I then not see my granddaughters to-day, as I do every
      Sunday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming in a carriage, father, and Dagobert accompanies
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the matter? you appear full of thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, father,&rdquo; said the marshal, with a somewhat agitated
      air, &ldquo;I have serious things to talk about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, then,&rdquo; said the old man, with some anxiety. The
      marshal and his father disappeared at the turn of the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angela had been struck with amazement at seeing this brilliant General,
      who was entitled &ldquo;your grace,&rdquo; salute an old workman in a
      blouse as his father; and, looking at Agricola with a confused air she
      said to him: &ldquo;What, M. Agricola! this old workman&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the father of Marshal Duke de Ligny&mdash;the friend&mdash;yes,
      I may say the friend,&rdquo; added Agricola, with emotion, &ldquo;of my
      father, who for twenty years served under him in war.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be placed so high, and yet to be so respectful and tender to his
      father!&rdquo; said Angela. &ldquo;The marshal must have a very noble
      heart; but why does he let his father remain a workman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Father Simon will not quit his trade and the factory for
      anything in the world. He was born a workman, and he will die a workman,
      though he is the father of a duke and marshal of France.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LI. THE SECRET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the very
      natural astonishment which the arrival of Marshal Simon had caused in
      Angela had passed away, Agricola said to her with a smile: &ldquo;I do not
      wish to take advantage of this circumstance, Mdlle. Angela, to spare you
      the account of the secret, by which all the wonders of our Common
      Dwelling-house are brought to pass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I should not have let you forget your promise, M. Agricola,&rdquo;
      answered Angela, &ldquo;what you have already told me interests me too
      much for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, then. M. Hardy, like a true magician, has pronounced three
      cabalistic words: ASSOCIATION&mdash;COMMUNITY&mdash;FRATERNITY. We have
      understood the sense of these words, and the wonders you have seen have
      sprung from them, to our great advantage; and also, I repeat, to the great
      advantage of M. Hardy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that which appears so extraordinary, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, mademoiselle, that M. Hardy, instead of being what he is,
      had only been a cold-hearted speculator, looking merely to the profit, and
      saying to himself: &lsquo;To make the most of my factory, what is needed?
      Good work&mdash;great economy in the raw material&mdash;full employment of
      the workman&rsquo;s time; in a word, cheapness of manufacture, in order to
      produce cheaply&mdash;excellence of the thing produced, in order to sell
      dear.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, M. Agricola, no manufacturer could desire more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mademoiselle, these conditions might have been fulfilled, as
      they have been, but how? Had M. Hardy only been a speculator, he might
      have said: &lsquo;At a distance from my factory, my workmen might have
      trouble to get there: rising earlier, they will sleep less; it is a bad
      economy to take from the sleep so necessary to those who toil. When they
      get feeble, the work suffers for it; then the inclemency of the seasons
      makes it worse; the workman arrives wet, trembling with cold, enervated
      before he begins to work&mdash;and then, what work!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfortunately but too true, M. Agricola. At Lille, when I
      reached the factory, wet through with a cold rain, I used sometimes to
      shiver all day long at my work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20485m.jpg" alt="20485m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20485.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, Mdlle. Angela, the speculator might say: &lsquo;To lodge
      my workmen close to the door of my factory would obviate this
      inconvenience. Let us make the calculation. In Paris the married workman
      pays about two hundred and fifty francs a-year,(30) for one or two
      wretched rooms and a closet, dark, small, unhealthy, in a narrow,
      miserable street; there he lives pell-mell with his family. What ruined
      constitutions are the consequence! and what sort of work can you expect
      from a feverish and diseased creature? As for the single men, they pay for
      a smaller, and quite as unwholesome lodging, about one hundred and fifty
      francs a-year. Now, let us make the addition. I employ one hundred and
      forty-six married workmen, who pay together, for their wretched holes,
      thirty-six thousand five hundred francs; I employ also one hundred and
      fifteen bachelors, who pay at the rate of seventeen thousand two hundred
      and eighty francs; the total will amount to about fifty thousand francs
      per annum, the interest on a million.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, M. Agricola! what a sum to be produced by uniting all
      these little rents together!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, mademoiselle, that fifty thousand francs a-year is a
      millionaire&rsquo;s rent. Now, what says our speculator: To induce our
      workmen to leave Paris, I will offer them, enormous advantages. I will
      reduce their rent one-half, and, instead of small, unwholesome rooms, they
      shall have large, airy apartments, well-warmed and lighted, at a trifling
      charge. Thus, one hundred and forty-six families, paying me only one
      hundred and twenty-five francs a-year, and one hundred and fifteen
      bachelors, seventy-five francs, I shall have a total of twenty-six to
      twenty-seven thousand francs. Now, a building large enough to hold all
      these people would cost me at most five hundred thousand francs.(31) I
      shall then have invested my money at five per cent at the least, and with
      perfect security, since the wages is a guarantee for the payment of the
      rent.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, M. Agricola! I begin to understand how it may sometimes be
      advantageous to do good, even in a pecuniary sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am almost certain, mademoiselle, that, in the long run,
      affairs conducted with uprightness and honesty turn out well. But to
      return to our speculator. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; will he say, &lsquo;are my
      workmen, living close to my factory, well lodged, well warmed, and
      arriving always fresh at their work. That is not all; the English workman
      who eats good beef, and drinks good beer, does twice as much, in the same
      time, as the French workman,(32) reduced to a detestable kind of food,
      rather weakening than the reverse, thanks to the poisonous adulteration of
      the articles he consumes. My workmen will then labor much better, if they
      eat much better. How shall I manage it without loss? Now I think of it,
      what is the food in barracks, schools, even prisons? Is it not the union
      of individual resources which procures an amount of comfort impossible to
      realize without such an association? Now, if my two hundred and sixty
      workmen, instead of cooking two hundred and sixty detestable dinners, were
      to unite to prepare one good dinner for all of them, which might be done,
      thanks to the savings of all sorts that would ensue, what an advantage for
      me and them! Two or three women, aided by children, would suffice to make
      ready the daily repasts; instead of buying wood and charcoal in
      fractions,(33) and so paying for it double its value, the association of
      my workmen would, upon my security (their wages would be an efficient
      security for me in return), lay in their own stock of wood, flour, butter,
      oil, wine, etc., all which they would procure directly from the producers.
      Thus, they would pay three or four sous for a bottle of pure wholesome
      wine, instead of paying twelve or fifteen sous for poison. Every week the
      association would buy a whole ox, and some sheep, and the women would make
      bread, as in the country. Finally, with these resources, and order, and
      economy, my workmen may have wholesome, agreeable, and sufficient food,
      for from twenty to twenty-five sous a day.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! this explains it, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not all, mademoiselle. Our cool-headed speculator would
      continue: &lsquo;Here are my workmen well lodged, well warmed, well fed,
      with a saving of at least half; why should they not also be warmly clad?
      Their health will then have every chance of being good, and health is
      labor. The association will buy wholesale, and at the manufacturing price
      (still upon my security, secured to me by their wages), warm, good, strong
      materials, which a portion of the workmen&rsquo;s wives will be able to
      make into clothes as well as any tailor. Finally, the consumption of caps
      and shoes being considerable, the association will obtain them at a great
      reduction in price.&rsquo; Well, Mdlle. Angela! what do you say to our
      speculator?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, M. Agricola,&rdquo; answered the young girl; with ingenuous
      admiration, &ldquo;that it is almost incredible, and yet so simple!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, nothing is more simple than the good and beautiful, and
      yet we think of it so seldom. Observe, that our man has only been speaking
      with a view to his own interest&mdash;only considering the material side
      of the question&mdash;reckoning for nothing the habit of fraternity and
      mutual aid, which inevitably springs from living together in common&mdash;not
      reflecting that a better mode of life improves and softens the character
      of man&mdash;not thinking of the support and instruction which the strong
      owe to the weak&mdash;not acknowledging, in fine, that the honest, active,
      and industrious man has a positive right to demand employment from
      society, and wages proportionate to the wants of his condition. No, our
      speculator only thinks of the gross profits; and yet, you see, he invests
      his money in buildings at five per cent., and finds the greatest
      advantages in the material comfort of his workmen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will you say, mademoiselle, when I prove to you that our
      speculator finds also a great advantage in giving to his workmen, in
      addition to their regular wages, a proportionate share of his profits?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That appears to me more difficult to prove, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I will convince you of it in a few minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus conversing, Angela and Agricola had reached the garden-gate of the
      Common Dwelling-house. An elderly woman, dressed plainly, but with care
      and neatness, approached Agricola, and asked him: &ldquo;Has M. Hardy
      returned to the factory, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame; but we expect him hourly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, perhaps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day or to-morrow, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot tell me at what hour he will be here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it is known, madame, but the porter of the factory,
      who also belongs to M. Hardy&rsquo;s private house, may, perhaps, be able
      to inform you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite welcome, madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Agricola,&rdquo; said Angela, when the woman who had just
      questioned him was gone, &ldquo;did you remark that this lady was very
      pale and agitated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed it as you did, mademoiselle; I thought I saw tears
      standing in her eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she seemed to have been crying. Poor woman! perhaps she came
      to ask assistance of M. Hardy. But what ails you, M. Agricola? You appear
      quite pensive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola had a vague presentiment that the visit of this elderly woman
      with so sad a countenance, had some connection with the adventure of the
      young and pretty lady, who, three days before had come all agitated and in
      tears to inquire after M. Hardy, and who had learned&mdash;perhaps too
      late&mdash;that she was watched and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Agricola to Angela; &ldquo;but
      the presence of this old lady reminded me of a circumstance, which,
      unfortunately, I cannot tell you, for it is a secret that does not belong
      to me alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not trouble yourself, M. Agricola,&rdquo; answered the young
      girl, with a smile; &ldquo;I am not inquisitive, and what we were talking
      of before interests me so much, that I do not wish to hear you speak of
      anything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then mademoiselle, I will say a few words more, and you will
      be as well informed as I am of the secrets of our association.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us still keep in view the speculator from mere interest.
      &lsquo;Here are my workmen, says he, &lsquo;in the best possible condition
      to do a great deal of work. Now what is to be done to obtain large
      profits? Produce cheaply, and sell dear. But there will be no cheapness,
      without economy in the use of the raw material, perfection of the
      manufacturing process, and celerity of labor. Now, in spite of all my
      vigilance, how am I to prevent my workmen from wasting the materials? How
      am I to induce them, each in his own province, to seek for the most simple
      and least irksome processes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, M. Agricola; how is that to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And that is not all,&rsquo; says our man; &lsquo;to sell my
      produce at high prices, it should be irreproachable, excellent. My workmen
      do pretty well; but that is not enough. I want them to produce
      masterpieces.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M. Agricola, when they have once performed the task set them
      what interest have workmen to give themselves a great deal of trouble to
      produce masterpieces?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is, Mdlle. Angela; what interest have they? Therefore, our
      speculator soon says to himself: &lsquo;That my workmen may have an
      interest to be economical in the use of the materials, an interest to
      employ their time well, an interest to invent new and better manufacturing
      processes, an interest to send out of their hands nothing but masterpieces&mdash;I
      must give them an interest in the profits earned by their economy,
      activity, zeal and skill. The better they manufacture, the better I shall
      sell, and the larger will be their gain and mine also.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! now I understand, M. Agricola.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our speculator would make a good speculation. Before he was
      interested, the workman said: &lsquo;What does it matter to me, that I do
      more or do better in the course of the day? What shall I gain by it?
      Nothing. Well, then, little work for little wages. But now, on the
      contrary (he says), I have an interest in displaying zeal and economy. All
      is changed. I redouble my activity, and strive to excel the others. If a
      comrade is lazy, and likely to do harm to the factory, I have the right to
      say to him: &lsquo;Mate, we all suffer more or less from your laziness,
      and from the injury you are doing the common weal.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, M. Agricola, with what ardor, courage, and hope, you must
      set to work!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what our speculator counts on; and he may say to himself,
      further: &lsquo;Treasures of experience and practical wisdom are often
      buried in workshops, for want of goodwill, opportunity, or encouragement.
      Excellent workmen, instead of making all the improvements in their power,
      follow with indifference the old jog-trot. What a pity! for an intelligent
      man, occupied all his life with some special employment, must discover, in
      the long run, a thousand ways of doing his work better and quicker. I will
      form, therefore, a sort of consulting committee; I will summon to it my
      foremen and my most skillful workmen. Our interest is now the same. Light
      will necessarily spring from this centre of practical intelligence.&rsquo;
      Now, the speculator is not deceived in this, and soon struck with the
      incredible resources, the thousand new, ingenious, perfect inventions
      suddenly revealed by his workmen, &lsquo;Why&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;if
      you knew this, did you not tell it before? What for the last ten years has
      cost me a hundred francs to make, would have cost me only fifty, without
      reckoning an enormous saving of time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; answers
      the workman, who is not more stupid than others, &lsquo;what interest had
      I, that you should effect a saving of fifty per cent? None. But now it is
      different. You give me, besides my wages, a share in your profits; you
      raise me in my own esteem, by consulting my experience and knowledge.
      Instead of treating me as an inferior being, you enter into communion with
      me. It is my interest, it is my duty, to tell you all I know, and to try
      to acquire more.&rsquo; And thus it is, Mdlle. Angela, that the speculator
      can organize his establishment, so as to shame his oppositionists, and
      provoke their envy. Now if, instead of a cold hearted calculator, we tape
      a man who unites with the knowledge of these facts the tender and generous
      sympathies of an evangelical heart, and the elevation of a superior mind,
      he will extend his ardent solicitude; not only to the material comfort,
      but to the moral emancipation, of his workmen. Seeking everywhere every
      possible means to develop their intelligence, to improve their hearts, and
      strong in the authority acquired by his beneficence, feeling that he on
      whom depends the happiness or the misery of three hundred human creatures
      has also the care of souls, he will be the guide of those whom he no
      longer calls his workmen, but his brothers, in a straightforward and noble
      path, and will try to create in them the taste for knowledge and art,
      which will render them happy and proud of a condition of life that is
      often accepted by others with tears and curses of despair. Well, Mdlle.
      Angela, such a man is&mdash;but, see! he could not arrive amongst us
      except in the middle of a blessing. There he is&mdash;there is M. Hardy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Agricola!&rdquo; said Angela, deeply moved, and drying her
      tears; &ldquo;we should receive him with our hands clasped in gratitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look if that mild and noble countenance is not the image of his
      admirable soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage with post horses, in which was M. Hardy, with M. de Blessac,
      the unworthy friend who was betraying him in so infamous a manner, entered
      at this moment the courtyard of the factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while after, a humble hackney-coach was seen advancing also
      towards the factory, from the direction of Paris. In this coach was Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      (30) The average price of a workman&rsquo;s lodging, composed of two small
      rooms and a closet at most, on the third or fourth story.
    </p>
    <p>
      (31) This calculation is amply sufficient, if not excessive. A similar
      building, at one league from Paris, on the side of Montrouge, with all the
      necessary offices, kitchen, wash-houses, etc., with gas and water laid on,
      apparatus for warming, etc., and a garden of ten acres, cost, at the
      period of this narrative, hardly five hundred thousand francs. An
      experienced builder less obliged us with an estimate, which confirms what
      we advance. It is, therefore, evident, that, even at the same price which
      workmen are in the habit of paying, it would be possible to provide them
      with perfectly healthy lodgings, and yet invest one&rsquo;s money at ten
      per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      (32) The fact was proved in the works connected with the Rouen Railway.
      Those French workmen who, having no families, were able to live like the
      English, did at least as much work as the latter, being strengthened by
      wholesome and sufficient nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      (33) Buying penny-worths, like all other purchases at minute retail, are
      greatly to the poor man&rsquo;s disadvantage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. REVELATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the visit of
      Angela and Agricola to the Common Dwelling-house, the band of Wolves,
      joined upon the road by many of the haunters of taverns, continued to
      march towards the factory, which the hackney-coach, that brought Rodin
      from Paris, was also fast approaching. M. Hardy, on getting out of the
      carriage with his friend, M. de Blessac, had entered the parlor of the
      house that he occupied next the factory. M. Hardy was of middle size, with
      an elegant and slight figure, which announced a nature essentially nervous
      and impressionable. His forehead was broad and open, his complexion pale,
      his eyes black, full at once of mildness and penetration, his countenance
      honest, intelligent, and attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word will paint the character of M. Hardy. His mother had called him
      her Sensitive Plant. His was indeed one of those fine and exquisitely
      delicate organizations, which are trusting, loving, noble, generous, but
      so susceptible, that the least touch makes them shrink into themselves. If
      we join to this excessive sensibility a passionate love for art, a
      first-rate intellect, tastes essentially refined, and then think of the
      thousand deceptions, and numberless infamies of which M. Hardy must have
      been the victim in his career as a manufacturer, we shall wonder how this
      heart, so delicate and tender, had not been broken a thousand times, in
      its incessant struggle with merciless self-interest. M. Hardy had indeed
      suffered much. Forced to follow the career of productive industry, to
      honor the engagements of his father, a model of uprightness and probity,
      who had yet left his affairs somewhat embarrassed, in consequence of the
      events of 1815, he had succeeded, by perseverance and capacity, in
      attaining one of the most honorable positions in the commercial world.
      But, to arrive at this point, what ignoble annoyances had he to bear with,
      what perfidious opposition to combat, what hateful rivalries to tire out!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensitive as he was, M. Hardy would a thousand times have fallen a victim
      to his emotions of painful indignation against baseness, of bitter disgust
      at dishonesty, but for the wise and firm support of his mother. When he
      returned to her, after a day of painful struggles with odious deceptions,
      he found himself suddenly transported into an atmosphere of such
      beneficent purity, of such radiant serenity, that he lost almost on the
      instant the remembrance of the base things by which he had been so cruelly
      tortured during the day; the pangs of his heart were appeased at the mere
      contact of her great and lofty soul; and therefore his love for her
      resembled idolatry. When he lost her, he experienced one of those calm,
      deep sorrows which have no end&mdash;which become, as it were, part of
      life, and have even sometimes their days of melancholy sweetness. A little
      while after this great misfortune, M. Hardy became more closely connected
      with his workmen. He had always been a just and good master; but, although
      the place that his mother left in his heart would ever remain void, he
      felt as it were a redoubled overflowing of the affections, and the more he
      suffered, the more he craved to see happy faces around him. The wonderful
      ameliorations, which he now produced in the physical and moral condition
      of all about him, served, not to divert, but to occupy his grief. Little
      by little, he withdrew from the world, and concentrated his life in three
      affections: a tender and devoted friendship, which seemed to include all
      past friendships&mdash;a love ardent and sincere, like a last passion&mdash;and
      a paternal attachment to his workmen. His days therefore passed in the
      heart of that little world, so full of respect and gratitude towards him&mdash;a
      world, which he had, as it were, created after the image of his mind, that
      he might find there a refuge from the painful realities he dreaded,
      surrounded with good, intelligent, happy beings, capable of responding to
      the noble thoughts which had become more and more necessary to his
      existence. Thus, after many sorrows, M. Hardy, arrived at the maturity of
      age, possessing a sincere friend, a mistress worthy of his love, and
      knowing himself certain of the passionate devotion of his workmen, had
      attained, at the period of this history, all the happiness he could hope
      for since his mother&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Blessac, his bosom friend, had long been worthy of his touching and
      fraternal affection; but we have seen by what diabolical means Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and Rodin had succeeded in making M. de Blessac, until then upright and
      sincere, the instrument of their machinations. The two friends, who had
      felt on their journey a little of the sharp influence of the north wind,
      were warming themselves at a good fire lighted in M. Hardy&rsquo;s parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear Marcel, I begin really to get old,&rdquo; said M.
      Hardy, with a smile, addressing M. de Blessac; &ldquo;I feel more and more
      the want of being at home. To depart from my usual habits has become
      painful to me, and I execrate whatever obliges me to leave this happy
      little spot of ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I think,&rdquo; answered M. de Blessac, unable to forbear
      blushing, &ldquo;when I think, my friend, that you undertook this long
      journey only for my sake!&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Marcel! have you not just accompanied me in your
      turn, in an excursion which, without you, would have been as tiresome as
      it has been charming?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a difference, my friend! I have contracted towards you a debt
      that I can never repay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear Marcel! Between us, there are no distinctions of
      meum and tuum. Besides, in matters of friendship, it is as sweet to give
      as to receive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble heart! noble heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, happy heart!&mdash;most happy, in the last affections for
      which it beats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who, gracious heaven! could deserve happiness on earth, if it
      be not you, my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to what do I owe that happiness? To the affections which I
      found here, ready to sustain me, when deprived of the support of my
      mother, who was all my strength, I felt myself (I confess my weakness)
      almost incapable of standing up against adversity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my friend&mdash;with so firm and resolute a character in doing
      good&mdash;you, that I have seen struggle with so much energy and courage,
      to secure the triumph of some great and noble idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but the farther I advance in my career, the more am I
      disgusted with all base and shameful actions, and the less strength I feel
      to encounter them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it necessary, you would have the courage, my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Marcel,&rdquo; replied M. Hardy, with mild and restrained
      emotion, &ldquo;I have often said to you: My courage was my mother. You
      see, my friend, when I went to her, with my heart torn by some horrible
      ingratitude, or disgusted by some base deceit, she, taking my hands
      between her own venerable palms, would say to me in her grave and tender
      voice: &lsquo;My dear child, it is for the ungrateful and dishonest to
      suffer; let us pity the wicked, let us forget evil, and only think of
      good.&rsquo;&mdash;Then, my friend, this heart, painfully contracted,
      expanded beneath the sacred influence of the maternal words, and every day
      I gathered strength from her, to recommence on the morrow a cruel struggle
      with the sad necessities of my condition. Happily, it has pleased God,
      that, after losing that beloved mother, I have been able to bind up my
      life with affections, deprived of which, I confess, I should find myself
      feeble and disarmed for you cannot tell, Marcel, the support, the strength
      that I have found in your friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak of me, my dear friend,&rdquo; replied M. de Blessac,
      dissembling his embarrassment. &ldquo;Let us talk of another affection,
      almost as sweet and tender as that of a mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, my good Marcel,&rdquo; replied M. Hardy: &ldquo;I
      have concealed nothing from you since, under such serious circumstances, I
      had recourse to the counsels of your friendship. Well! yes; I think that
      every day I live augment my adoration for this woman, the only one that I
      have ever passionately loved, the only one that I shall now ever love. And
      then I must tell you, that my mother, not knowing what Margaret was to me,
      as often loud in her praise, and that circumstance renders this love
      almost sacred in my eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then there are such strange resemblances between Mme. de Noisy&rsquo;s
      character and yours, my friend; above all, in her worship of her mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, Marcel; that affection has often caused me both
      admiration and torment. How often she has said to me, with her habitual
      frankness: &lsquo;I have sacrificed all for you, but I would sacrifice you
      for my mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven, my friend, you will never see Mme. de Noisy exposed
      to that cruel choice. Her mother, you say, has long renounced her
      intention of returning to America, where M. de Noisy, perfectly careless
      of his wife, appears to have settled himself permanently. Thanks to the
      discreet devotion of the excellent woman by whom Margaret was brought up,
      your love is concealed in the deepest mystery. What could disturb it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;oh! nothing,&rdquo; cried M. Hardy. &ldquo;I have
      almost security for its duration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know if I ought to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever found me indiscreet, my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, good Marcel! how can you suppose such a thing?&rdquo; said M.
      Hardy, in a tone of friendly reproach; &ldquo;no! but I do not like to
      tell you of my happiness, till it is complete; and I am not yet quite
      certain&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant entered at this moment and said to M. Hardy: &ldquo;Sir, there
      is an old gentleman who wishes to speak to you on very pressing business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon!&rdquo; said M. Hardy, with a slight movement of
      impatience. &ldquo;With your permission, my friend.&rdquo; Then, as M. de
      Blessac seemed about to withdraw into the next room, M. Hardy added with a
      smile: &ldquo;No, no; do not stir. Your presence will shorten the
      interview.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it be a matter of business, my friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do everything openly, as you know.&rdquo; Then, addressing the
      servant, M. Hardy bade him: &ldquo;Ask the gentleman to walk in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The postilion wishes to know if he is to wait?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly: he will take M. de Blessac back to Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant withdrew, and presently returned, introducing Rodin, with whom
      M. de Blessac was not acquainted, his treacherous bargain having been
      negotiated through another agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy?&rdquo; said Rodin, bowing respectfully to the two
      friends, and looking from one to the other with an air of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name, sir; what can I do to serve you?&rdquo; answered
      the manufacturer, kindly; for, at first sight of the humble and
      ill-dressed old man, he expected an application for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Francois Hardy,&rdquo; repeated Rodin, as if he wished to make
      sure of the identity of the person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had the honor to tell you that I am he.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a private communication to make to you, sir,&rdquo; said
      Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may speak, sir. This gentleman is my friend,&rdquo; said M.
      Hardy, pointing to M. de Blessac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish to speak to you alone, sir,&rdquo; resumed Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Blessac was again about to withdraw, when M. Hardy retained him with
      a glance, and said to Rodin kindly, for he thought his feelings might be
      hurt by asking a favor in presence of a third party: &ldquo;Permit me to
      inquire if it is on your account or on mine, that you wish this interview
      to be secret?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your account entirely, sir,&rdquo; answered Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said M. Hardy, with some surprise, &ldquo;you may
      speak out. I have no secrets from this gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, Rodin resumed, addressing himself to M.
      Hardy: &ldquo;Sir, you deserve, I know, all the good that is said of you;
      and you therefore command the sympathy of every honest man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, as an honest man, I come to render you a service.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this service, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To reveal to you an infamous piece of treachery, of which you have
      been the victim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, you must be deceived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the proofs of what I assert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proofs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The written proofs of the treachery that I come to reveal: I have
      them here,&rdquo; answered Rodin &ldquo;In a word, a man whom you believed
      your friend, has shamefully deceived you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the name of this man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Marcel de Blessac,&rdquo; replied Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, M. de Blessac started, and became pale as death. He could
      hardly murmur: &ldquo;Sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, without looking at his friend, or perceiving his agitation, M. Hardy
      seized his hand, and exclaimed hastily: &ldquo;Silence, my friend!&rdquo;
      Then, whilst his eye flashed with indignation, he turned towards Rodin,
      who had not ceased to look him full in the face, and said to him, with an
      air of lofty disdain: &ldquo;What! do you accuse M. de Blessac?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I accuse him,&rdquo; replied Rodin, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what do you accuse him? And how dare you say that he has
      betrayed me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two words, if you please,&rdquo; said Rodin, with an emotion which
      he appeared hardly able to restrain. &ldquo;If one man of honor sees
      another about to be slain by an assassin, ought he not give the alarm of
      murder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but what has that to do&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my eyes, sir, certain treasons are as criminal as murders: I
      have come to place myself between the assassin and his victim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The assassin? the victim?&rdquo; said M. Hardy more and more
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doubtless know M. de Blessac&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo; said
      Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then read this,&rdquo; said Rodin, drawing from his pocket a
      letter, which he handed to M. Hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting now for the first time a glance at M. de Blessac, the manufacturer
      drew back a step, terrified at the death-like paleness of this man, who,
      struck dumb with shame, could not find a word to justify himself; for he
      was far from possessing the audacious effrontery necessary to carry him
      through his treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcel!&rdquo; cried M. Hardy, in alarm, and deeply agitated by
      this unexpected blow. &ldquo;Marcel! how pale you are! you do not answer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcel! this, then, is M. de Blessac?&rdquo; cried Rodin, feigning
      the most painful surprise. &ldquo;Oh, sir, if I had known&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you hear this man, Marcel?&rdquo; cried M. Hardy.
      &ldquo;He says that you have betrayed me infamously.&rdquo; He seized the
      hand of M. de Blessac. That hand was cold as ice. &ldquo;Oh, God! Oh God!&rdquo;
      said M. Hardy, drawing back in horror: &ldquo;he makes no answer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20493.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I am in presence of M. de Blessac,&rdquo; resumed Rodin,
      &ldquo;I am forced to ask him, if he can deny having addressed many
      letters to the Rue du Milieu des Ursins, at Paris under cover of M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Blessac remained dumb. M. Hardy, still unwilling to believe what he
      saw and heard, convulsively tore open the letter, which Rodin had just
      delivered to him, and read the first few lines&mdash;interrupting the
      perusal with exclamations of grief and amazement. He did not require to
      finish the letter, to convince himself of the black treachery of M. de
      Blessac. He staggered; for a moment his senses seemed to abandon him. The
      horrible discovery made him giddy, and his head swam on his first look
      down into that abyss of infamy. The loathsome letter dropped from his
      trembling hands. But soon indignation, rage, and scorn succeeded this
      moment of despair, and rushing, pale and terrible, upon M. de Blessac:
      &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a threatening gesture. But,
      pausing as in the act to strike: &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he added, with fearful
      calmness. &ldquo;It would be to soil my hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards Rodin, who had approached hastily, as if to interpose.
      &ldquo;It is not worth while chastising a wretch,&rdquo; said M. Hardy;
      &ldquo;But I will press your honest hand, sir&mdash;for you have had the
      courage to unmask a traitor and a coward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried M. de Blessac, overcome with shame; &ldquo;I am
      at your orders&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not finish. The sound of voices was heard behind the door, which
      opened violently, and an aged woman entered, in spite of the efforts of
      the servant, exclaiming in an agitated voice: &ldquo;I tell you, I must
      speak instantly to your master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this voice, and at sight of the pale, weeping woman, M. Hardy,
      forgetting M. de Blessac, Rodin, the infamous treachery, and all, fell
      back a step, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Madame Duparc! you here! What is the
      matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! a great misfortune&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; cried M. Hardy, in a tone of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; repeated M. Hardy, as horror-struck as if a
      thunderbolt had fallen at his feet. &ldquo;Margaret gone!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;All is discovered. Her mother took her away&mdash;three days ago!&rdquo;
      said the unhappy woman, in a failing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone! Margaret! It is not true. You deceive me,&rdquo; cried M.
      Hardy. Refusing to hear more, wild, despairing, he rushed out of the
      house, threw himself into his carriage, to which the post-horses were
      still harnessed, waiting for M. de Blessac, and said to the postilion:
      &ldquo;To Paris! as fast as you can go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the carriage, rapid as lightning, started upon the road to Paris, the
      wind brought nearer the distant sound of the war-song of the Wolves, who
      were rushing towards the factory. In this impending destruction, see Rodin&rsquo;s
      subtle hand, administering his fatal blows to clear his way up to the
      chair of St. Peter to which he aspired. His tireless, wily course can
      hardly be darker shadowed by aught save that dread coming horror the
      Cholera, whose aid he evoked, and whose health the Bacchanal Queen wildly
      drank.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE WANDERING JEW&rsquo;S CHASTISEMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tis night&mdash;the moon is brightly shining, the brilliant stars
      are sparkling in a sky of melancholy calmness, the shrill whistlings of a
      northerly wind&mdash;cold, bleak, and evil-bearing&mdash;are increasing:
      winding about, and bursting into violent blasts, with their harsh and
      hissing gusts, they are sweeping the heights of Montmartre. A man is
      standing on the very summit of the hill; his lengthened shadow, thrown out
      by the moon&rsquo;s pale beams, darkens the rocky ground in the distance.
      The traveller is surveying the huge city lying at his feet&mdash;the City
      of Paris&mdash;from whose profundities are cast up its towers, cupolas,
      domes, and steeples, in the bluish moisture of the horizon; while from the
      very centre of this sea of stones is rising a luminous vapor, reddening
      the starry azure of the sky above. It is the distant light of a myriad
      lamps which at night, the season for pleasure, is illuminating the noisy
      capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;it will not be. The Lord
      surely will not suffer it. Twice is quite enough. Five centuries ago, the
      avenging hand of the Almighty drove me hither from the depths of Asia. A
      solitary wanderer, I left in my track more mourning, despair, disaster,
      and death, than the innumerable armies of a hundred devastating conquerors
      could have produced. I then entered this city, and it was decimated. Two
      centuries ago that inexorable hand which led me through the world again
      conducted me here; and on that occasion, as on the previous one, that
      scourge, which at intervals the Almighty binds to my footsteps, ravaged
      this city, attacking first my brethren, already wearied by wretchedness
      and toil. My brethren! through me&mdash;the laborer of Jerusalem, cursed
      by the Lord, who in my person cursed the race of laborers&mdash;a race
      always suffering, always disinherited, always slaves, who like me, go on,
      on, on, without rest or intermission, without recompense, or hope; until
      at length, women, men, children, and old men, die under their iron yoke of
      self-murder, that others in their turn then take up, borne from age to age
      on their willing but aching shoulders. And here again, for the third time,
      in the course of five centuries, I have arrived at the summit of one of
      the hills which overlooks the city; and perhaps I bring again with me
      terror, desolation, and death. And this unhappy city, intoxicated in a
      whirl of joys, and nocturnal revelries, knows nothing about it&mdash;oh!
      it knows not that I am at its very gate. But no! no! my presence will not
      be a source of fresh calamity to it. The Lord, in His unsearchable wisdom,
      has brought me hither across France, making me avoid on my route all but
      the humblest villages, so that no increase of the funeral knell has,
      marked my journey. And then, moreover, the spectre has left me&mdash;that
      spectre, livid and green, with its deep bloodshot eyes. When I touched the
      soil of France, its moist and icy hand abandoned mine&mdash;it
      disappeared. And yet I feel the atmosphere of death surrounding me still.
      There is no cessation; the biting gusts of this sinister wind, which
      envelop me in their breath, seem by their envenomed breath to propagate
      the scourge. Doubtless the anger of the Lord is appeased. Maybe, my
      presence here is meant only as a threat, intending to bring those to their
      senses whom it ought to intimidate. It must be so; for were it otherwise,
      it would, on the contrary, strike a loud-sounding blow of greater terror,
      casting at once dread and death into the very heart of the country, into
      the bosom of this immense city. Oh, no! no! the Lord will have mercy; He
      will not condemn me to this new affliction. Alas! in this city my brethren
      are more numerous and more wretched than in any other. And must I bring
      death to them? No! the Lord will have mercy; for, alas! the seven
      descendants of my sister are at last all united in this city. And must I
      bring death to them? Death! instead of that immediate assistance they
      stand so much in need of? For that woman who, like myself, wanders from
      one end of the world into the other, has gone now on her everlasting
      journey, after having confounded their enemies&rsquo; plots. In vain did
      she foretell that great evils still threatened those who are akin to me
      through my sister&rsquo;s blood. The unseen hand by which I am led, drives
      that woman away from me, even as though it were a whirlwind that swept her
      on. In vain she entreated and implored at the moment she was leaving those
      who are so dear to me.&mdash;At least, 0 Lord, permit me to stay until I
      shall have finished my task! Onward! A few days, for mercy&rsquo;s sake,
      only a few days! Onward! I leave these whom I am protecting on the very
      brink of an abyss! Onward! Onward!! And the wandering star is launched
      afresh on its perpetual course. But her voice traversed through space,
      calling me to the assistance of my own! When her voice reached me I felt
      that the offspring of my sister were still exposed to fearful dangers:
      those dangers are still increasing. Oh, say, say, Lord! shall the
      descendants of my sister escape those woes which for so many centuries
      have oppressed my race? Wilt Thou pardon me in them? Wilt Thou punish me
      in them? Oh! lead them, that they may obey the last wishes of their
      ancestor. Guide them, that they may join their charitable hearts, their
      powerful strength, their best wisdom, and their immense wealth, and work
      together for the future happiness of mankind, thereby, perhaps, enabled to
      ransom me from my eternal penalties. Let those divine words of the Son of
      Man, &lsquo;Love ye one another!&rsquo; be their only aim; and by the
      assistance of their all-powerful words, let them contend against and
      vanquish those false priests who have trampled on the precepts of love, of
      peace, and hope commanded by the Saviour, setting up in their stead the
      precepts of hatred, violence, and despair. Those false shepherds,
      supported ay the powerful and wealthy of the world, who in all times have
      been their accomplices, instead of asking here below a little happiness
      for my brethren, who have been suffering and groaning for centuries, dare
      to utter, in Thy name, O Lord! that the poor must always be doomed to the
      tortures of this world, and that it is criminal in Thine eyes that they
      should either wish for or hope a mitigation of their sufferings on earth,
      because the happiness of the few and the wretchedness of nearly all
      mankind is Thine almighty will. Blasphemies! is it not the contrary of
      these homicidal words that is more worthy of the name of Divine will?
      Hear, me, O Lord! for mercy&rsquo;s sake. Snatch from their enemies the
      descendants of my sister, from the artisan up to the king&rsquo;s son. Do
      not permit them to crush the germ of a mighty and fruitful association,
      which, perhaps, under Thy protection, may take its place among the records
      of the happiness of mankind. Suffer me, O Lord! to unite those whom they
      are endeavoring to divide&mdash;to defend those whom they are attacking.
      Suffer me to bring hope to those from whom hope has fled, to give courage
      to those who are weak, to uphold those whom evil threatens, and to sustain
      those who would persevere in well-doing. And then, perhaps, their
      struggles, their devotedness, their virtues, this miseries might expiate
      my sin. Yes, mine&mdash;misfortune, misfortune alone, made me unjust and
      wicked. O Lord! since Thine almighty hand hath brought me hither, for some
      end unknown to me, disarm Thyself, I implore Thee, of Thine anger, and let
      not me be the instrument of Thy vengeance! There is enough of mourning in
      the earth these two years past&mdash;Thy creatures have fallen by millions
      in my footsteps. The world is decimated. A veil of mourning extends from
      one end of the globe to the other. I have traveled from Asia even to the
      Frozen Pole, and death has followed in my wake. Dost Thou not hear, O
      Lord! the universal wailings that mount up to Thee? Have mercy upon all,
      and upon me. One day, grant me but a single day, that I may collect the
      descendants of my sister together, and save them!&rdquo; And uttering
      these words, the wanderer fell upon his knees, and raised his hands to
      heaven in a suppliant attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the wind howled with redoubled violence; its sharp whistlings
      changed to a tempest. The Wanderer trembled, and exclaimed in a voice of
      terror, &ldquo;O Lord! the blast of death is howling in its rage. It
      appears as though a whirlwind were lifting me up. Lord, wilt Thou not,
      then, hear my prayer? The spectre! O! do I behold the spectre? Yes, there
      it is; its cadaverous countenance is agitated by convulsive throes, its
      red eyes are rolling in their orbits. Begone! begone! Oh! its hand&mdash;its
      icy hand has seized on mine! Mercy, Lord, have mercy! &lsquo;Onward!&rsquo;
      Oh, Lord! this scourge, this terrible avenging scourge! Must I, then,
      again carry it into this city, must my poor wretched brethren be the first
      to fall under it&mdash;though already so miserable? Mercy, mercy! &lsquo;Onward!&rsquo;
      And the descendants of my sister&mdash;oh, pray, have mercy, mercy!
      &lsquo;Onward!&rsquo; O Lord, have pity on me! I can no longer keep my
      footing on the ground, the spectre is dragging me over the brow of the
      hill; my course is as rapid as the death-bearing wind that whistles in my
      track; I already approach the walls of the city. Oh, mercy, Lord, mercy on
      the descendants of my sister&mdash;spare them! do not compel me to be
      their executioner, and let them triumph over their enemies. Onward,
      onward! The ground is fleeing from under me; I am already at the city
      gate; oh, yet, Lord, yet there is time; oh, have mercy on this slumbering
      city, that it may not even now awaken with the lamentations of terror, of
      despair and death! O Lord, I touch the threshold of the gate; verily Thou
      willest it so then. &lsquo;Tis done&mdash;Paris! the scourge is in thy
      bosom! oh, cursed, cursed evermore am I. Onward! on! on!&rdquo;(34)

      (34) In 1346, the celebrated Black Death ravaged the earth, presenting the
      same symptoms as the cholera, and the same inexplicable phenomena as to
      its progress and the results in its route. In 1660 a similar epidemic
      decimated the world. It is well known that when the cholera first broke
      out in Paris, it had taken a wide and unaccountable leap; and, also
      memorable, a north-east wind prevailed during its utmost fierceness.

      February the 13th, 1832.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &mdash;&mdash;-PRAY FOR ME!
</pre>
    <p>
      The son of the King of Mundi had lost his father and his domains in India
      by the irresistible march of the English, and was but in title Prince
      Djalma. Spite of attempts to make his departure from the East delayed
      until after the period when he could have obeyed his medal&rsquo;s
      command, he had reached France by the second month of 1832. Nevertheless,
      the results of shipwreck had detained him from Paris till after that date.
      A second possessor of this token had remained unaware of its existence,
      only discovered by accident. But an enemy who sought to thwart the union
      of these seven members, had shut her up in a mad-house, from which she was
      released only after that day. Not alone was she in imprisonment. An old
      Bonapartist, General Simon, Marshal of France, and Duke de Ligny, had left
      a wife in Russian exile, while he (unable to follow Napoleon to St.
      Helena) continued to fight the English in India by means of Prince Djalma&rsquo;s
      Sepoys, whom he drilled. On the latter&rsquo;s defeat, he had meant to
      accompany his young friend to Europe, induced the more by finding that the
      latter&rsquo;s mother, a Frenchwoman, had left him such another bronze
      medal as he knew his wife to have had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, his wife had perished in Siberia, without his knowing it, any
      more than he did, that she had left twin daughters, Rose and Blanche.
      Fortunately for them, one who had served their father in the Grenadiers of
      the Guard. Francis Baudoin, nicknamed Dagobert, undertook to fulfil the
      dying mother&rsquo;s wishes, inspired by the medal. Saving a check at
      Leipsic, where one Morok the lion-tamer&rsquo;s panther had escaped from
      its cage and killed Dagobert&rsquo;s horse, and a subsequent imprisonment
      (which the Wandering Jew&rsquo;s succoring hand had terminated) the
      soldier and his orphan charges had reached Paris in safety and in time.
      But there, a renewal of the foe&rsquo;s attempt had gained its end. By
      skillful devices, Dagobert and his son Agricola were drawn out of the way
      while Rose and Blanche Simon were decoyed into a nunnery, under the eyes
      of Dagobert&rsquo;s wife. But she had been bound against interfering by
      the influence of the Jesuit confessional. The fourth was M. Hardy, a
      manufacturer, and the fifth, Jacques Rennepont, a drunken scamp of a
      workman, who were more easily fended off, the latter in a sponging house,
      the former by a friend&rsquo;s lure. Adrienne de Cardoville, daughter of
      the Count of Rennepont, who had also been Duke of Cardoville, was the lady
      who had been unwarrantably placed in the lunatic asylum. The fifth,
      unaware of the medal, was Gabriel, a youth, who had been brought up,
      though a foundling, in Dagobert&rsquo;s family, as a brother to Agricola.
      He had entered holy orders, and more, was a Jesuit, in name though not in
      heart. Unlike the others, his return from abroad had been smoothed. He had
      signed away all his future prospects, for the benefit of the order of
      Loyola, and, moreover, executed a more complete deed of transfer on the
      day, the 13th of February, 1832, when he, alone of the heirs, stood in the
      room of the house, No. 3, Rue St. Francois, claiming what was a vast
      surprise for the Jesuits, who, a hundred and fifty years before, had
      discovered that Count Marius de Rennepont had secreted a considerable
      amount of his wealth, all of which had been confiscated to them, in those
      painful days of dragoonings, and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
      They had bargained for some thirty or forty millions of francs to be
      theirs, by educating Gabriel into resigning his inheritance to them, but
      it was two hundred and twelve millions which the Jesuit representatives
      (Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and his secretary, Rodin) were amazed to hear
      their nursling placed in possession of. They had the treasure in their
      hands, in fact, when a woman of strangely sad beauty had mysteriously
      entered the room where the will had been read, and laid a paper before the
      notary. It was a codicil, duly drawn up and signed, deferring the carrying
      out of the testament until the first day of June the same year. The
      Jesuits fled from the house, in rage and intense disappointment. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      was so stupor-stricken at the defeat, that he bade his secretary at once
      write off to Rome that the Rennepont inheritance had escaped them, and
      hopes to seize it again were utterly at an end. Upon this, Rodin had
      revolted, and shown that he had authority to command where he had, so far,
      most humbly obeyed. Many such spies hang about their superior&rsquo;s
      heels, with full powers to become the governor in turn, at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice. Thenceforward, he, Rodin, had taken the business into his own
      hands. He had let Rose and Blanche Simon out of the convent into their
      father&rsquo;s arms. He had gone in person to release Adrienne de
      Cardoville from the asylum. More, having led her to sigh for Prince
      Djalma, he prompted the latter to burn for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let not M. Hardy escape. A friend whom the latter treated as a brother,
      had been shown up to him as a mere spy of the Jesuits; the woman whom he
      adored, a wedded woman, alas! who had loved him in spite of her vows, had
      been betrayed. Her mother had compelled her to hide her shame in America,
      and, as she had often said&mdash;&ldquo;Much as you are endeared to me, I
      cannot waver between you and my mother!&rdquo; so she had obeyed, without
      one farewell word to him. Confess, Rodin was a more dextrous man than his
      late master! In the pages that ensue farther proofs of his superiority in
      baseness and satanic heartlessness will not be wanting.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE ATTACK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n M. Hardy&rsquo;s
      learning from the confidential go-between of the lovers, that his mistress
      had been taken away by her mother, he turned from Rodin and dashed away in
      a post carriage. At the same moment, as loud as the rattle of the wheels,
      there arose the shouts of a band of workmen and rioters, hired by the
      Jesuit&rsquo;s emissaries, coming to attack Hardy&rsquo;s operatives. An
      old grudge long existing between them and a rival manufacturer&rsquo;s&mdash;Baron
      Tripeaud&mdash;laborers, fanned the flames. When M. Hardy had left the
      factory, Rodin, who was not prepared for this sudden departure, returned
      slowly to his hackney-coach; but he stopped suddenly, and started with
      pleasure and surprise, when he saw, at some distance, Marshall Simon and
      his father advancing towards one of the wings of the Common
      Dwelling-house; for an accidental circumstance had so far delayed the
      interview of the father and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Rodin. &ldquo;Better and better! Now, only
      let my man have found out and persuaded little Rose-Pompon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rodin hastened towards his hackney-coach. At this moment, the wind,
      which continued to rise, brought to the ear of the Jesuit the war song of
      the approaching Wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workman was in the garden. The marshal said to him, in a voice of such
      deep emotion that the old man started; &ldquo;Father, I am very unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A painful expression, until then concealed, suddenly darkened the
      countenance of the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You unhappy?&rdquo; cried father Simon, anxiously, as he pressed
      nearer to the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some days, my daughters have appeared constrained in manner,
      and lost in thought. During the first moments of our re-union, they were
      mad with joy and happiness. Suddenly, all has changed; they are becoming
      more and more sad. Yesterday, I detected tears in their eyes; then deeply
      moved, I clasped them in my arms, and implored them to tell me the cause
      of their sorrow. Without answering, they threw themselves on my neck, and
      covered my face with their tears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange. To what do you attribute this alteration?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, I think I have not sufficiently concealed from them the
      grief occasioned me by the loss of their mother, and they are perhaps
      miserable that they do not suffice for my happiness. And yet (inexplicable
      as it is) they seem not only to understand, but to share my sorrow.
      Yesterday, Blanche said to me: &lsquo;How much happier still should we be,
      if our mother were with us!&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharing your sorrow, they cannot reproach you with it. There must
      be some other cause for their grief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the marshal, looking fixedly at his father;
      &ldquo;yes&mdash;but to penetrate this secret&mdash;it would be necessary
      not to leave them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First learn, father, what are the duties which would keep me here;
      then you shall know those which may take me away from you, from my
      daughters, and from my other child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other child?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son of my old friend, the Indian Prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma? Is there anything the matter with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, he frightens me. I told you, father, of his mad and unhappy
      passion for Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that frighten you, my son?&rdquo; said the old man, looking at
      the marshal with surprise. &ldquo;Djalma is only eighteen, and, at that
      age, one love drives away another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea of the ravages which the passion has already made
      in the ardent, indomitable boy; sometimes, fits of savage ferocity follow
      the most painful dejection. Yesterday, I came suddenly upon him; his eyes
      were bloodshot, his features contracted with rage; yielding to an impulse
      of mad furry, he was piercing with his poinard a cushion of red cloth,
      whilst he exclaimed, panting for breath, &lsquo;Ha blood!&mdash;I will
      have blood!&rsquo; &lsquo;Unhappy boy!&rsquo; I said to him, &lsquo;what
      means this insane passion?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m killing the man!&rsquo;
      replied he, in a hollow and savage voice: it is thus he designates his
      supposed rival.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is indeed something terrible,&rdquo; said the old man,
      &ldquo;in such a passion, in such a heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At other times,&rdquo; resumed the marshal, &ldquo;it is against
      Mdlle. de Cardoville that his rage bursts forth; and at others, against
      himself. I have been obliged to remove his weapons, for a man who came
      with him from Java, and who appears much attached to him, has informed me
      that he suspected him of entertaining some thoughts of suicide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; said Marshal Simon, with profound bitterness;
      &ldquo;it is at the moment when my daughters and my adopted son require
      all my solicitude, that I am perhaps on the eve of quitting them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of quitting them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to fulfil a still more sacred duty than that imposed by
      friendship or family,&rdquo; said the marshal, in so grave and solemn a
      tone, that his father exclaimed, with deep emotion: &ldquo;What can this
      duty be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the marshal, after remaining a moment in
      thoughtful silence, &ldquo;who made me what I am? Who gave me the ducal
      title, and the marshal&rsquo;s baton?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Napoleon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you, the stern republican, I know that he lost all his value,
      when from the first citizen of a Republic he became an emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cursed his weakness,&rdquo; said Father Simon, sadly; &ldquo;the
      demi-god sank into a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for me, father&mdash;for me, the soldier, who have always
      fought beside him, or under his eye&mdash;for me, whom he raised from the
      lowest rank in the army to the highest&mdash;for me, whom he loaded with
      benefits and marks of affection&mdash;for me, he was more than a hero, he
      was a friend&mdash;and there was as much gratitude as admiration in my
      idolatry for him. When he was exiled, I would fain have shared his exile;
      they refused me that favor; then I conspired, then I drew my sword against
      those who had robbed his son of the crown which France had given him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in your position, you did well, Pierre; without sharing your
      admiration, I understood your gratitude. The projects of exile, the
      conspiracies&mdash;I approved them all&mdash;you know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, that disinherited child, in whose name I conspired
      seventeen years ago, is now of an age to wield his father&rsquo;s sword.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Napoleon II!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, looking at his son with
      surprise and extreme anxiety; &ldquo;the king of Rome!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King? no; he is no longer king. Napoleon? no; he is no longer
      Napoleon. They have given him some Austrian name, because the other
      frightened them. Everything frightens them. Do you know what they are
      doing with the son of the Emperor?&rdquo; resumed the marshal, with
      painful excitement. &ldquo;They are torturing him&mdash;killing him by
      inches!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody who knows, whose words are but too true. Yes; the son of
      the Emperor struggles with all his strength against a premature death.
      With his eyes turned towards France, he waits&mdash;he waits&mdash;and no
      one comes&mdash;no one&mdash;out of all the men that his father made as
      great as they once were little, not one thinks of that crowned child, whom
      they are stifling, till he dies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you think of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I had first to learn&mdash;oh! there is no doubt of it,
      for I have not derived all my information from the same source&mdash;I had
      first to learn the cruel fate of this youth, to whom I also swore
      allegiance; for one day, as I have told you, the Emperor, proud and loving
      father as he was, showed him to me in his cradle, and said: &lsquo;My old
      friend, you will be to the son what you have been to the father; who loves
      us, loves our France.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it. Many times you have repeated those words to me,
      and, like yourself, I have been moved by them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father! suppose, informed of the sufferings of the son of the
      Emperor, I had seen&mdash;with the positive certainty that I was not
      deceived&mdash;a letter from a person of high rank in the court of Vienna,
      offering to a man that was still faithful to the Emperor&rsquo;s memory,
      the means of communicating with the king of Rome, and perhaps of saving
      him from his tormentors&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; said the workman, looking fixedly at his son.
      &ldquo;Suppose Napoleon II. once at liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; exclaimed the marshal. Then he added, in a
      suppressed voice: &ldquo;Do you think, father, that France is insensible
      to the humiliations she endures? Do you think that the memory of the
      Emperor is extinct? No, no; it is, above all, in the days of our country&rsquo;s
      degredation, that she whispers that sacred name. How would it be, then,
      were that name to rise glorious on the frontier, reviving in his son? Do
      you not think that the heart of all France would beat for him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This implies a conspiracy&mdash;against the present government&mdash;with
      Napoleon II. for a watchword,&rdquo; said the workman. &ldquo;This is very
      serious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, father, that I was very unhappy; judge if it be not so,&rdquo;
      cried the marshal. &ldquo;Not only I ask myself, if I ought to abandon my
      children and you, to run the risk of so daring an enterprise, but I ask
      myself if I am not bound to the present government, which, in
      acknowledging my rank and title, if it bestowed no favor, at least did me
      an act of justice. How shall I decide?&mdash;abandon all that I love, or
      remain insensible to the tortures of Emperor&mdash;of that Emperor to the
      son of the whom I owe everything&mdash;to whom I have sworn fidelity, both
      to himself and child? Shall I lose this only opportunity, perhaps, of
      saving him, or shall I conspire in his favor? Tell me, if I exaggerate
      what I owe to the memory of the Emperor? Decide for me, father! During a
      whole sleepless night, I strove to discover, in the midst of this chaos,
      the line prescribed by honor; but I only wandered from indecision to
      indecision. You alone, father&mdash;you alone, I repeat, can direct me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After remaining for some moments in deep thought, the old man was about to
      answer, when some person, running across the little garden, opened the
      door hastily, and entered the room in which were the marshal and his
      father. It was Olivier, the young workman, who had been able to effect his
      escape from the village in which the Wolves had assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Simon! M. Simon!&rdquo; cried he, pale, and panting for breath.
      &ldquo;They are here&mdash;close at hand. They have come to attack the
      factory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried the old man, rising hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wolves, quarrymen, and stone-cutters, joined on the road by a
      crowd of people from the neighborhood, and vagabonds from town. Do you not
      hear them? They are shouting, &lsquo;Death to the Devourers!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clamor was indeed approaching, and grew more and more distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same noise that I heard just now,&rdquo; said the
      marshal, rising in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are more than two hundred of them, M. Simon,&rdquo; said
      Olivier; &ldquo;they are armed with clubs and stones, and unfortunately
      the greater part of our workmen are in Paris. We are not above forty here
      in all; the women and children are already flying to their chambers,
      screaming for terror. Do you not hear them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceiling shook beneath the tread of many hasty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will this attack be a serious one?&rdquo; said the marshal to his
      father, who appeared more and more dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very serious,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;there is nothing more
      fierce than these combats between different unions; and everything has
      been done lately to excite the people of the neighborhood against the
      factory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are so inferior in number,&rdquo; said the marshal, &ldquo;you
      must begin by barricading all the doors&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unable to conclude. A burst of ferocious cries shook the windows of
      the room, and seemed so near and loud, that the marshal, his father, and
      the young workman, rushed out into the little garden, which was bounded on
      one side by a wall that separated it from the fields. Suddenly whilst the
      shouts redoubled in violence, a shower of large stones, intended to break
      the windows of the house, smashed some of the panes on the first story,
      struck against the wall, and fell into the garden, all around the marshal
      and his father. By a fatal chance, one of these large stones struck the
      old man on the head. He staggered, bent forward, and fell bleeding into
      the arms of Marshal Simon, just as arose from without, with increased
      fury, the savage cries of, &ldquo;Death to the Devourers!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE WOLVES AND THE DEVOURERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a frightful
      thing to view the approach of the lawless crowd, whose first act of
      hostility had been so fatal to Marshal Simon&rsquo;s father. One wing of
      the Common Dwelling-house, which joined the garden-wall on that side, was
      next to the fields. It was there that the Wolves began their attack. The
      precipitation of their march, the halt they had made at two public-houses
      on the road, their ardent impatience for the approaching struggle, had
      inflamed these men to a high pitch of savage excitement. Having discharged
      their first shower of stones, most of the assailants stooped down to look
      for more ammunition. Some of them, to do so with greater ease, held their
      bludgeons between their teeth; others had placed them against the wall;
      here and there, groups had formed tumultuously round the principal leaders
      of the band; the most neatly dressed of these men wore frocks, with caps,
      whilst others were almost in rags, for, as we have already said, many of
      the hangers-on at the barriers, and people without any profession, had
      joined the troop of the Wolves, whether welcome or not. Some hideous
      women, with tattered garments, who always seem to follow in the track of
      such people, accompanied them on this occasion, and, by their cries and
      fury, inflamed still more the general excitement. One of them, tall,
      robust, with purple complexion, blood shot eyes, and toothless jaws, had a
      handkerchief over her head, from beneath which escaped her yellow, frowsy
      hair. Over her ragged gown, she wore an old plaid shawl, crossed over her
      bosom, and tied behind her back. This hag seemed possessed with a demon.
      She had tucked up her half-torn sleeves; in one hand she brandished a
      stick, in the other she grasped a huge stone; her companions called her
      Ciboule (scullion).
    </p>
    <p>
      This horrible hag exclaimed, in a hoarse voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bite the
      women of the factory; I&rsquo;ll make them bleed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ferocious words were received with applause by her companions, and
      with savage cries of &ldquo;Ciboule forever!&rdquo; which excited her to
      frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the other leaders, was a small, dry pale man, with the face of a
      ferret, and a black beard all round the chin; he wore a scarlet Greek cap,
      and beneath his long blouse, perfectly new, appeared a pair of neat cloth
      trousers, strapped over thin boots. This man was evidently of a different
      condition of life from that of the other persons in the troop; it was he,
      in particular, who ascribed the most irritating and insulting language to
      the workmen of the factory, with regard to the inhabitants of the
      neighborhood. He howled a great deal, but he carried neither stick nor
      stone. A full-faced, fresh-colored man, with a formidable bass voice, like
      a chorister&rsquo;s, asked him: &ldquo;Will you not have a shot at those
      impious dogs, who might bring down the Cholera on the country, as the
      curate told us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have a better shot than you,&rdquo; said the little man,
      with a singular, sinister smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with what, I&rsquo;d like to see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, with this,&rdquo; said the little man, stooping to pick
      up a large stone; but, as he bent, a well-filled though light bag, which
      he appeared to carry under his blouse, fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, you are losing both bag and baggage,&rdquo; said the other;
      &ldquo;it does not seem very heavy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are samples of wool,&rdquo; answered the man with the ferret&rsquo;s
      face, as he hastily picked up the bag, and replaced it under his blouse;
      then he added: &ldquo;Attention! the big blaster is going to speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, he who exercised the most complete ascendency over this
      irritated crowd was the terrible quarryman. His gigantic form towered so
      much above the multitude, that his great head, bound in its ragged
      handkerchief, and his Herculean shoulders, covered with a fallow goat
      skin, were always visible above the level of that dark and swarming crowd,
      only relieved here and there by a few women&rsquo;s caps, like so many
      white points. Seeing to what a degree of exasperation the minds of the
      crowd had reached, the small number of honest, but misguided workmen, who
      had allowed themselves to be drawn into this dangerous enterprise, under
      the pretext of a quarrel between rival unions, now fearing for the
      consequences of the struggle, tried, but too late, to abandon the main
      body. Pressed close, and as it were, girt in with the more hostile groups,
      dreading to pass for cowards, or to expose themselves to the bad treatment
      of the majority, they were forced to wait for a more favorable moment to
      effect their escape. To the savage cheers, which had accompanied the first
      discharge of stones, succeeded a deep silence commanded by the stentorian
      voice of the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wolves have howled,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;let us wait and
      see how the Devourers will answer, and when they will begin the fight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must draw them out of their factory, and fight them on neutral
      ground,&rdquo; said the little man with the ferret&rsquo;s face, who
      appeared to be the thieves&rsquo; advocate; &ldquo;otherwise there would
      be trespass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20511.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care about trespass?&rdquo; cried the horrible hag,
      Ciboule; &ldquo;in or out, I will tear the chits of the factory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried other hideous creatures, as ragged as
      Ciboule herself; &ldquo;we must not leave all to the men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have our fun, too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women of the factory say that all the women of the neighborhood
      are drunken drabs,&rdquo; cried the little man with the ferret&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! we&rsquo;ll pay them for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women shall have their share.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They like to sing in their Common House,&rdquo; cried Ciboule;
      &ldquo;we will make them sing the wrong side of their mouths, in the key
      of &lsquo;Oh, dear me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This pleasantry was received with shouts, hootings, and furious stamping
      of feet, to which the stentorian voice of the quarryman put a term by
      roaring: &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; repeated the crowd. &ldquo;Hear the
      blaster!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Devourers are cowards enough not to dare to show themselves,
      after a second volley of stones, there is a door down there which we can
      break open, and we will soon hunt them from their holes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better to draw them out, so that none might remain in
      the factory,&rdquo; said the little old man with the ferret&rsquo;s face,
      who appeared to have some secret motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man fights where he can,&rdquo; cried the quarryman, in a voice
      of thunder; &ldquo;all, right, if we can but once catch hold. We could
      fight on a sloping roof, or on the top of a wall&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t we,
      my Wolves?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried the crowd, still more excited by those
      savage words; &ldquo;if they don&rsquo;t come out, we will break in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see their fine palace!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pagans haven&rsquo;t even a chapel,&rdquo; said the bass voice.
      &ldquo;The curate has damned them all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should they have a palace, and we nothing but dog-kennels?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardy&rsquo;s workmen say that kennels are good enough for such as
      you.&rdquo; said the little man with the ferret&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! they said so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll break all their traps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pull down their bazaar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll throw the house out of the windows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we have made the mealy-mouthed chits sing,&rdquo; cried
      Ciboule, &ldquo;we will make them dance to the clatter of stones on their
      heads.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my Wolves! attention!&rdquo; cried the quarryman, still in
      the same stentorian voice; &ldquo;one more volley, and if the Devourers do
      not come out, down with the door!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition was received with cheers of savage ardor, and the
      quarryman, whose voice rose above the tumult, cried with all the strength
      of his herculean lungs: &ldquo;Attention, my Wolves. Make ready! all
      together. Now, are you ready?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;all ready!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, present!&mdash;fire!&rdquo; And, for the second time, a
      shower of enormous stones poured upon that side of the Common
      Dwelling-house which was turned towards the fields. A part of these
      projectiles broke such of the windows as had been spared by the first
      volley. To the sharp smashing and cracking of glass were joined the
      ferocious cries uttered in chorus by this formidable mob, drunk with its
      own excesses: &ldquo;Death to the Devourers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon these outcries became perfectly frantic, when, through the broken
      windows, the assailants perceived women running in terror, some with
      children in their arms, and others raising their hands to heaven, calling
      aloud for help; whilst a few, bolder than the rest, leaned out of the
      windows, and tried to fasten the outside blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There come the ants out of their holes!&rdquo; cried Ciboule,
      stooping to pick up a stone. &ldquo;We must have a fling at them for luck!&rdquo;
      The stone, hurled by the steady, masculine hand of the virago, went
      straight to its mark, and struck an unfortunate woman who was trying to
      close one of the shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit in the white!&rdquo; cried the hideous creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Ciboule!&mdash;you&rsquo;ve rapped her coker-nut!&rdquo;
      cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ciboule forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out, you Devourers, if you dare!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have said a hundred times, that the neighbors were too
      cowardly even to come and look at their house,&rdquo; squealed the little
      man with the ferret&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now they show the white feather!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they will not come out,&rdquo; cried the quarryman, in voice of
      thunder, &ldquo;let us smoke them out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s break open the door!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sure to find them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! come on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, with the quarryman at their head, and Ciboule not far from him,
      brandishing a stick, advanced tumultously towards one of the great doors.
      The ground shook beneath the rapid tread of the mob, which had now ceased
      shouting; but the confused, and, as it were, subterraneous noise, sounded
      even more ominous than those savage outcries. The Wolves soon arrived
      opposite the massive oaken door. At the moment the blaster raised a
      sledgehammer, the door opened suddenly. Some of the most determined of the
      assailants were about to rush in at this entrance; but the quarryman
      stepped back, extending his arm as if to moderate their ardor and impose
      silence. Then his followers gathered round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-open door discovered a party of workmen, unfortunately by no
      means numerous, but with countenances full of resolution. They had armed
      themselves hastily with forks, iron bars, and clubs. Agricola, who was
      their leader, held in his hand a heavy sledge-hammer. The young workman
      was very pale; but the fire of his eye, his menacing look, and the
      intrepid assurance of his bearing, showed that his father&rsquo;s blood
      boiled in his veins, and that in such a struggle he might become
      fear-inspiring. Yet he succeeded in restraining himself, and challenged
      the quarryman, in a firm voice: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fight!&rdquo; thundered the blaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! a fight!&rdquo; repeated the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, my Wolves!&rdquo; cried the quarryman, as he turned round,
      and stretched forth his large hand towards the multitude. Then addressing
      Agricola, he said: &ldquo;The Wolves have come to ask for a fight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the Devourers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no Devourers here,&rdquo; replied Agricola; &ldquo;we are
      only peaceable workmen. So begone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! here are the Wolves, that will eat your quiet workmen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wolves will eat no one here,&rdquo; said Agricola, looking full
      at the quarryman, who approached him with a threatening air; &ldquo;they
      can only frighten little children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you think so,&rdquo; said the quarryman, with a savage sneer.
      Then raising his weapon, he shook it in Agricola&rsquo;s face, exclaiming:
      &ldquo;Is that any laughing matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that?&rdquo; answered Agricola, with a rapid movement, parrying
      the stone sledge with his own hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iron against iron&mdash;hammer against hammer&mdash;that suits me,&rdquo;
      said the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter what suits you,&rdquo; answered Agricola, hardly
      able to restrain himself. &ldquo;You have broken our windows, frightened
      our women, and wounded&mdash;perhaps killed&mdash;the oldest workman in
      the factory, who at this moment lies bleeding in the arms of his son.&rdquo;
      Here Agricola&rsquo;s voice trembled in spite of himself. &ldquo;It is, I
      think, enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the Wolves are hungry for more,&rdquo; answered the blaster;
      &ldquo;you must come out (cowards that you are!), and fight us on the
      plain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes! battle!&mdash;let them come out!&rdquo; cried the crowd,
      howling, hissing, waving their sticks and pushing further into the small
      space which separated them from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have no battle,&rdquo; answered Agricola: &ldquo;we will
      not leave our home; but if you have the misfortune to pass this,&rdquo;
      said Agricola, throwing his cap upon the threshold, and setting his foot
      on it with an intrepid air, &ldquo;if you pass this, you attack us in our
      own house, and you will be answerable for all that may happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There or elsewhere we will have the fight! the Wolves must eat the
      Devourers. Now for the attack!&rdquo; cried the fierce quarryman, raising
      his hammer to strike Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the latter, throwing himself on one side by a sudden leap, avoided the
      blow, and struck with his hammer full at the chest of the quarryman, who
      staggered for a moment, but instantly recovering his legs, rushed
      furiously on Agricola, crying: &ldquo;Follow me, Wolves!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V. THE RETURN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s soon as the
      combat had begun between Agricola and the blaster, the general fight
      became terrible, ardent, implacable. A flood of assailants, following the
      quarryman&rsquo;s steps, rushed into the house with irresistible fury;
      others, unable to force their way through this dreadful crowd, where the
      more impetuous squeezed, stifled, and crushed these who were less so, went
      round in another direction, broke through some lattice work, and thus
      placed the people of the factory, as it were, between two fires. Some
      resisted courageously; others, seeing Ciboule, followed by some of her
      horrible companions, and by several of the most ill-looking ruffians,
      hastily enter that part of the Common-Dwelling house in which the women
      had taken refuge, hurried in pursuit of this band; but some of the hag&rsquo;s
      companions, having faced about, and vigorously defended the entrance of
      the staircase against the workmen, Ciboule, with three or four like
      herself, and about the same number of no less ignoble men, rushed through
      the rooms, with the intention of robbing or destroying all that came in
      their way. A door, which at first resisted their efforts, was soon broken
      through; Ciboule rushed into the apartment with a stick in her hand, her
      hair dishevelled, furious, and, as it were, maddened with the noise and
      tumult. A beautiful young girl (it was Angela), who appeared anxious to
      defend the entrance to a second chamber, threw herself on her knees, pale
      and supplicating, and raising her clasped hands, exclaimed: &ldquo;Do not
      hurt my mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll serve you out first, and your mother afterwards,&rdquo;
      replied the horrible woman, throwing herself on the poor girl, and
      endeavoring to tear her face with her nails, whilst the rest of the
      ruffianly band broke the glass and the clock with their sticks, and
      possessed themselves of some articles of wearing apparel.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      Angela, struggling with Ciboule, uttered loud cries of distress, and still
      attempted to guard the room in which her mother had taken refuge; whilst
      the latter, leaning from the window, called Agricola to their assistance.
      The smith was now engaged with the huge blaster. In a close struggle,
      their hammers had become useless, and with bloodshot eyes and clinched
      teeth, chest to chest, and limbs twined together like two serpents, they
      made the most violent efforts to overthrow each other. Agricola, bent
      forward, held under his right arm the left leg of the quarryman, which he
      had seized in parrying a violent kick; but such was the Herculean strength
      of the leader of the Wolves, that he remained firm as a tower, though
      resting only on one leg. With the hand that was still free (for the other
      was gripped by Agricola as in a vise), he endeavored with violent blows to
      break the jaws of the smith, who, leaning his head forward, pressed his
      forehead hard against the breast of his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Wolf will break the Devourer&rsquo;s teeth, and he shall devour
      no more,&rdquo; said the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no true Wolf,&rdquo; answered the smith, redoubling his
      efforts; &ldquo;the true Wolves are honest fellows, and do not come ten
      against one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True or false, I will break your teeth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I your paw,&rdquo; said the smith, giving so violent a wrench
      to the leg of the quarryman, that the latter uttered a cry of acute pain,
      and, with the rage of a wild beast, butting suddenly forward with his
      head, succeeded in biting Agricola in the side of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pang of this bite forced Agricola to make a movement, which enabled
      the quarryman to disengage his leg. Then, with a superhuman effort, he
      threw himself with his whole weight on Agricola, and brought him to the
      ground, falling himself upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Angela&rsquo;s mother, leaning from one of the windows
      of the Common Dwelling-house, exclaimed in a heart-rending voice: &ldquo;Help,
      Agricola!&mdash;they are killing my child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go&mdash;and on, my honor&mdash;I will fight you tomorrow,
      or when you will,&rdquo; said Agricola, panting for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No warmed-up food for me; I eat all hot,&rdquo; answered the
      quarryman, seizing the smith by the throat, whilst he tried to place one of
      his knees upon his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&mdash;they are killing my child!&rdquo; cried Angela&rsquo;s
      mother, in a voice of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! I ask mercy! Let me go!&rdquo;&rsquo; said Agricola, making
      the most violent efforts to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too hungry,&rdquo; answered the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exasperated by the terror which Angela&rsquo;s danger occasioned him,
      Agricola redoubled his efforts, when the quarryman suddenly felt his thigh
      seized by the sharp teeth of a dog, and at the same instant received from
      a vigorous hand three or four heavy blows with a stick upon his head. He
      relaxed his grasp, and fell stunned upon his hand and knee, whilst he
      mechanically raised his other arm to parry the blows, which ceased as soon
      as Agricola was delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you have saved me!&rdquo; cried the smith, springing up.
      &ldquo;If only I am in time to rescue Angela!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run!&mdash;never mind me!&rdquo; answered Dagobert; and Agricola
      rushed into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogabert, accompanied by Spoil-sport, had come, as we have already said,
      to bring Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters to their grandfather. Arriving in
      the midst of the tumult, the soldier had collected a few workmen to defend
      the entrance of the chamber, to which the marshal&rsquo;s father had been
      carried in a dying state. It was from this post that the soldier had seen
      Agricola&rsquo;s danger. Soon after, the rush of the conflict separated
      Dagobert from the quarryman, who remained for some moments insensible.
      Arrived in two bounds at the Common Dwelling-house, Agricola succeeded in
      forcing his way through the men who defended the staircase, and rushed
      into the corridor that led to Angela&rsquo;s chamber. At the moment he
      reached it, the unfortunate girl was mechanically guarding her face with
      both hands against Ciboule, who, furious as the hyena over its prey, was
      trying to scratch and disfigure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To spring upon the horrible hag, seize her by her yellow hair with
      irresistible hand, drag her backwards, and then with one cuff, stretch her
      full length upon the ground, was for Agricola an achievement as rapid as
      thought. Furious with rage, Ciboule rose again almost instantly; but at
      this moment, several workmen, who had followed close upon Agricola, were
      able to attack with advantage, and whilst the smith lifted the fainting
      form of Angela, and carried her into the next room, Ciboule and her band
      were driven from that part of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first fire of the assault, the small number of real Wolves, who,
      as Agricola said, were in the main honest fellows, but had the weakness to
      let themselves be drawn into this enterprise, under the pretext of a
      quarrel between rival unions, seeing the excesses committed by the rabble
      who accompanied them, turned suddenly round, and ranged themselves on the
      side of the Devourers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no longer here either Wolves or Devourers,&rdquo; said
      one of the most determined Wolves to Olivier, with whom he had been
      fighting roughly and fairly; &ldquo;there are none here but honest
      workmen, who must unite to drive out a set of scoundrels, that have come
      only to break and pillage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added another; &ldquo;it was against our will that they
      began by breaking your windows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The big blaster did it all,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;the true
      Wolves wash their hands of him. We shall soon settle his account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may fight every day&mdash;but we ought to esteem each
      other.&rdquo;(35)
    </p>
    <p>
      This defection of a portion of the assailants (unfortunately but a small
      portion) gave new spirit to the workmen of the factory, and all together,
      Wolves and Devourers, though very inferior in number, opposed themselves
      to the band of vagabonds, who were proceeding to new excesses. Some of
      these wretches, still further excited by the little man with the ferret&rsquo;s
      face, a secret emissary of Baron Tripeaud, now rushed in a mass towards
      the workshops of M. Hardy. Then began a lamentable devastation. These
      people, seized with the mania of destruction, broke without remorse
      machines of the greatest value, and most delicate construction; half
      manufactured articles were pitilessly destroyed; a savage emulation seemed
      to inspire these barbarians, and those workshops, so lately the model of
      order and well-regulated economy, were soon nothing but a wreck; the
      courts were strewed with fragments of all kinds of wares, which were
      thrown from the windows with ferocious outcries, or savage bursts of
      laughter. Then, still thanks to the incitements of the little man with the
      ferret&rsquo;s face, the books of M. Hardy, archives of commercial
      industry, so indispensable to the trader, were scattered to the wind,
      torn, trampled under foot, in a sort of infernal dance, composed of all
      that was most impure in this assembly of low, filthy, and ragged men and
      women, who held each other by the hand, and whirled round and round with
      horrible clamor. Strange and painful contrasts! At the height of the
      stunning noise of these horrid deeds of tumult and devastation, a scene of
      imposing and mournful calm was taking place in the chamber of Marshal
      Simon&rsquo;s father, the door of which was guarded by a few devoted men.
      The old workman was stretched on his bed, with a bandage across his blood
      stained white hair. His countenance was livid, his breathing oppressed,
      his look fixed and glazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshal Simon, standing at the head of the bed, bending over his father,
      watched in despairing anguish the least sign of consciousness on the part
      of the dying man, near whom was a physician, with his finger on the
      failing pulse. Rose and Blanche, brought hither by Dagobert, were kneeling
      beside the bed, their hands clasped, and their eyes bathed in tears; a
      little further, half hidden in the shadows of the room, for the hours had
      passed quickly, and the night was at hand, stood Dagobert himself, with
      his arms crossed upon his breast, and his features painfully contracted. A
      profound and solemn silence reigned in this chamber, only interrupted by
      the broken sobs of Rose and Blanche, or by Father Simon&rsquo;s hard
      breathing. The eyes of the marshal were dry, gloomy, and full of fire. He
      only withdrew them from his father&rsquo;s face, to interrogate the
      physician by a look. There are strange coincidences in life. That
      physician was Dr. Baleinier. The asylum of the doctor being close to the
      barrier that was nearest to the factory, and his fame being widely spread
      in the neighborhood, they had run to fetch him on the first call for
      medical assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Dr. Baleinier made a movement; the marshal, who had not taken
      his eyes off him, exclaimed: &ldquo;Is there any hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, my lord duke, the pulse revives a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is saved!&rdquo; said the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not cherish false hopes, my lord duke,&rdquo; answered the
      doctor, gravely: &ldquo;the pulse revives, owing to the powerful
      applications to the feet, but I know not what will be the issue of the
      crisis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! father! do you hear me?&rdquo; cried the marshal, seeing
      the old man slightly move his head, and feebly raise his eyelids. He soon
      opened his eyes, and this time their intelligence had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! you live&mdash;you know me!&rdquo; cried the marshal, giddy
      with joy and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre! are you there?&rdquo; said the old man, in a weak voice.
      &ldquo;Your hand&mdash;give&mdash;it&mdash;&rdquo; and he made a feeble
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, father!&rdquo; cried the marshal, as he pressed the hands of
      the old man in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, yielding to an impulse of delight, he bent over his father, covered
      his hands, face, and hair with kisses, and repeated: &ldquo;He lives! kind
      heaven, he lives! he is saved!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, the noise of the struggle which had recommenced between
      the rabble, the Wolves, and the Devourers, reached the ears of the dying
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That noise! that noise!&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;they are fighting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is growing less, I think,&rdquo; said the marshal, in order not
      to agitate his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre,&rdquo; said the old man, in a weak and broken voice,
      &ldquo;I have not long to live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak, child; if I can but tell you all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Baleinier piously to the old workman, &ldquo;heaven
      may perhaps work a miracle in your favor; show yourself grateful, and
      allow a priest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest! Thank you, sir&mdash;I have my son,&rdquo; said the old
      man; &ldquo;in his arms, I will render up my soul&mdash;which has always
      been true and honest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You die?&rdquo; exclaimed the marshal; &ldquo;no! no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre,&rdquo; said the old man, in a voice which, firm at first,
      gradually grew fainter, &ldquo;just now&mdash;you ask my advice in a very
      serious matter. I think, that the wish to tell you of your duty&mdash;has
      recalled me&mdash;for a moment&mdash;to life&mdash;for I should die
      miserable&mdash;if I thought you in a road unworthy of yourself and me.
      Listen to me, my son&mdash;my noble son&mdash;at this last hour, a father
      cannot deceive himself. You have a great duty to perform&mdash;-under pain&mdash;of
      not acting like a man of honor&mdash;under pain of neglecting my last
      will. You ought, without hesitation&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the voice failed the old man. When he had pronounced the last
      sentence, he became quite unintelligible. The only words that Marshal
      Simon could distinguish, were these: &ldquo;Napoleon II.&mdash;oath&mdash;dishonor&mdash;my
      son!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old workman again moved his lips mechanically&mdash;and all was
      over. At the moment he expired, the night was quite come, and terrible
      shouts were heard from without, of &ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; The
      conflagration had broken out in one of the workshops, filled with
      inflammable stuff, into which had glided the little man with the ferret&rsquo;s
      face. At the same time, the roll of drums was heard in the distance,
      announcing the arrival of a detachment of troops from town.
    </p>
    <p>
      During an hour, in spite of every effort, the fire had been spreading
      through the factory. The night is clear, cold, starlight; the wind blows
      keenly from the north, with a moaning sound. A man, walking across the
      fields, where the rising ground conceals the fire from him, advances with
      slow and unsteady steps. It is M. Hardy. He had chosen to return home on
      foot, across the country, hoping that a walk would calm the fever in his
      blood&mdash;an icy fever, more like the chill of death. He had not been
      deceived. His adored mistress&mdash;the noble woman, with whom he might
      have found refuge from the consequences of the fearful deception which had
      just been revealed to him&mdash;had quitted France. He could have no doubt
      of it. Margaret was gone to America. Her mother had exacted from her, in
      expiation of her fault, that she should not even write to him one word of
      farewell&mdash;to him, for whom she had sacrificed her duty as a wife.
      Margaret had obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, she had often said to him: &ldquo;Between my mother and you, I
      should not hesitate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not hesitated. There was therefore no hope, not the slightest;
      even if an ocean had not separated him from Margaret, he knew enough of
      her blind submission to her mother, to be certain that all relations
      between them were broken off forever. It is well. He will no longer reckon
      upon this heart&mdash;his last refuge. The two roots of his life have been
      torn up and broken, with the same blow, the same day, almost at the same
      moment. What then remains for thee, poor sensitive plant, as thy tender
      mother used to call thee? What remains to console thee for the loss of
      this last love&mdash;this last friendship, so infamously crushed? Oh!
      there remains for thee that one corner of the earth, created after the
      image of thy mind that little colony, so peaceful and flourishing, where,
      thanks to thee, labor brings with it joy and recompense. These worthy
      artisans, whom thou hast made happy, good, and grateful, will not fail
      thee. That also is a great and holy affection; let it be thy shelter in
      the midst of this frightful wreck of all thy most sacred convictions! The
      calm of that cheerful and pleasant retreat, the sight of the unequalled
      happiness of thy dependents, will soothe thy poor, suffering soul, which
      now seems to live only for suffering. Come! you will soon reach the top of
      the hill, from which you can see afar, in the plain below, that paradise
      of workmen, of which you are the presiding divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Hardy had reached the summit of the hill. At that moment the
      conflagration, repressed for a short time, burst forth with redoubled fury
      from the Common Dwelling-house, which it had now reached. A bright streak,
      at first white, then red, then copper-colored, illuminated the distant
      horizon. M. Hardy looked at it with a sort of incredulous, almost idiotic
      stupor. Suddenly, an immense column of flame shot up in the thick of a
      cloud of smoke, accompanied by a shower of sparks, and streamed towards
      the sky, casting a bright reflection over all the country, even to M.
      Hardy&rsquo;s feet. The violence of the north wind, driving the flames in
      waves before it, soon brought to the ears of M. Hardy the hurried clanging
      of the alarm-bell of the burning factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      (35) We wish it to be understood, that the necessities of our story alone
      have made the Wolves the assailants. While endeavoring to paint the evils
      arising the abuse of the spirit of association, we do not wish to ascribe
      a character of savage hostility to one sect rather than to the other to
      the Wolves more than to the Devourers. The Wolves, a club of united
      stone-cutters, are generally industrious, intelligent workmen, whose
      situation is the more worthy of interest, as not only their labors,
      conducted with mathematical precision, are of the rudest and most
      wearisome kind, but they are likewise out of work during three or four
      months of the year, their profession being, unfortunately, one of those
      which winter condemns to a forced cessation. A number of Wolves, in order
      to perfect themselves in their trade, attend every evening a course of
      linear geometry, applied to the cutting of stone, analogous to that given
      by M. Agricole Perdignier, for the benefit of carpenters. Several working
      stone-cutters sent an architectural model in plaster to the last
      exhibition.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE GO-BETWEEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few days have
      elapsed since the conflagration of M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory. The following
      scene takes place in the Rue Clovis, in the house where Rodin had lodged,
      and which was still inhabited by Rose-Pompon, who, without the least
      scruple, availed herself of the household arrangements of her friend
      Philemon. It was about noon, and Rose-Pompon, alone in the chamber of the
      student, who was still absent, was breakfasting very gayly by the
      fireside; but how singular a breakfast! what a queer fire! how strange an
      apartment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a large room, lighted by two windows without curtains&mdash;for as
      they looked on empty space, the lodger had fear of being overlooked. One
      side of this apartment served as a wardrobe, for there was suspended
      Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s flashy costume of debardeur, not far from the boat-man&rsquo;s
      jacket of Philemon, with his large trousers of coarse, gray stuff, covered
      with pitch (shiver my timbers!), just as if this intrepid mariner had
      bunked in the forecastle of a frigate, during a voyage round the globe. A
      gown of Rose Pompon&rsquo;s hung gracefully over a pair of pantaloons, the
      legs of which seemed to come from beneath the petticoat. On the lowest of
      several book-shelves, very dusty and neglected, by the side of three old
      boots (wherefore three boots?) and a number of empty bottles, stood a
      skull, a scientific and friendly souvenir, left to Philemon by one of his
      comrades, a medical student. With a species of pleasantry, very much to
      the taste of the student-world, a clay pipe with a very black bowl was
      placed between the magnificently white teeth of this skull; moreover, its
      shining top was half hidden beneath an old hat, set knowingly on one side,
      and adorned with faded flowers and ribbons. When Philemon was drunk, he
      used to contemplate this bony emblem of mortality, and break out into the
      most poetical monologues, with regard to this philosophical contrast
      between death and the mad pleasures of life. Two or three plaster casts,
      with their noses and chins more or less injured, were fastened to the
      wall, and bore witness to the temporary curiosity which Philemon had felt
      with regard to phrenological science, from the patient and serious study
      of which he had drawn the following logical conclusion:&mdash;That, having
      to an alarming extent the bump of getting into debt, he ought to resign
      himself to the fatality of this organization, and accept the inconvenience
      of creditors as a vital necessity. On the chimney-piece, stood uninjured,
      in all its majesty, the magnificent rowing-club drinking-glass, a china
      teapot without a spout, and an inkstand of black wood, the glass mouth of
      which was covered by a coat of greenish and mossy mould. From time to
      time, the silence of this retreat was interrupted by the cooing of
      pigeons, which Rose-Pompon had established with cordial hospitality in the
      little study. Chilly as a quail, Rose-Pompon crept close to the fire, and
      at the same time seemed to enjoy the warmth of a bright ray of sunshine,
      which enveloped her in its golden light. This droll little creature was
      dressed in the oddest costume, which, however, displayed to advantage the
      freshness of her piquant and pretty countenance, crowned with its fine,
      fair hair, always neatly combed and arranged the first thing in the
      morning. By way of dressing-gown, Rose-Pompon had ingeniously drawn over
      her linen, the ample scarlet flannel shirt which belonged to Philemon&rsquo;s
      official garb in the rowing-club; the collar, open and turned down,
      displayed the whiteness of the young girl&rsquo;s under garment, as also
      of her neck and shoulders, on whose firm and polished surface the scarlet
      shirt seemed to cast a rosy light. The grisette&rsquo;s fresh and dimpled
      arms half protruded from the large, turned-up sleeves; and her charming
      legs were also half visible, crossed one over the other, and clothed in
      neat white stockings, and boots. A black silk cravat formed the girdle
      which fastened the shirt round the wasp-like waist of Rose-Pompon, just
      above those hips, worthy of the enthusiasm of a modern Phidias, and which
      gave to this style of dress a grace very original.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20527.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      We have said, that the breakfast of Rose-Pompon was singular. You shall
      judge. On a little table placed before her, was a wash-hand-basin, into
      which she had recently plunged her fresh face, bathing it in pure water.
      From the bottom of this basin, now transformed into a salad-bowl, Rose
      Pompon took with the tips of her fingers large green leaves, dripping with
      vinegar, and crunched them between her tiny white teeth, whose enamel was
      too hard to allow them to be set on edge. Her drink was a glass of water
      and syrup of gooseberries, which she stirred with a wooden mustard-spoon.
      Finally, as an extra dish, she had a dozen olives in one of those blue
      glass trinket-dishes sold for twenty-five sous. Her dessert was composed
      of nuts, which she prepared to roast on a red-hot shovel. That
      Rose-Pompon, with such an unaccountable savage choice of food, should
      retain a freshness of complexion worthy of her name, is one of those
      miracles, which reveal the mighty power of youth and health. When she had
      eaten her salad, Rose-Pompon was about to begin upon her olives, when a
      low knock was heard at the door, which was modestly bolted on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend&mdash;the oldest of the old,&rdquo; replied a sonorous,
      jovial voice. &ldquo;Why do you lock yourself in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it you, Ninny Moulin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my beloved pupil. Open quickly. Time presses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open to you? Oh, I dare say!&mdash;that would be pretty, the figure
      I am!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you! what does it matter what figure you are? It would be
      very pretty, thou rosiest of all the roses with which Cupid ever adorned
      his quiver!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and preach fasting and morality in your journal, fat apostle!&rdquo;
      said Rose&mdash;Pompon, as she restored the scarlet shirt to its place,
      with Philemon&rsquo;s other garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! are we to talk much longer through the door, for the greater
      edification of our neighbors?&rdquo; cried Ninny Moulin. &ldquo;I have
      something of importance to tell you&mdash;something that will astonish you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me time to put on my gown, great plague that you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is because of my modesty, do not think of it. I am not over
      nice. I should like you very well as you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to think that such a monster is the favorite of all the
      churchgoers!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, opening the door as she finished
      fastening her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! you have at last returned to the dovecot, you stray girl!&rdquo;
      said Ninny Moulin, folding his arms, and looking at Rose-Pompon with comic
      seriousness. &ldquo;And where may you have been, I pray? For three days
      the naughty little bird has left its nest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; I only returned home last night. You must have called during
      my absence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came, every day, and even twice a day, young lady, for I have
      very serious matters to communicate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very serious matters? Then we shall have a good laugh at them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all&mdash;they are really serious,&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin,
      seating himself. &ldquo;But, first of all, what did you do during the
      three days that you left your conjugal and Philemonic home? I must know
      all about it, before I tell you more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have some olives?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, as she nibbled
      one of them herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your answer?&mdash;I understand!&mdash;Unfortunate
      Philemon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no unfortunate Philemon in the case, slanderer. Clara had
      a death in her house, and, for the first few days after the funeral she
      was afraid to sleep alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Clara sufficiently provided against such fears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are deceived, you great viper! I was obliged to go and
      keep the poor girl company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this assertion, the religious pamphleteer hummed a tune, with an
      incredulous and mocking air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I have played Philemon tricks?&rdquo; cried Rose-Pompon,
      cracking a nut with the indignation of injured innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say tricks; but one little rose-colored trick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, that it was not for my pleasure I went out. On the
      contrary&mdash;for, during my absence, poor Cephyse disappeared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mother Arsene told me that the Bacchanal-Queen was gone on a
      journey. But when I talk of Philemon, you talk of Cephyse; we don&rsquo;t
      progress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be eaten by the black panther that they are showing at the
      Porte Saint-Martin if I do not tell you the truth. And, talking of that,
      you must get tickets to take me to see those animals, my little Ninny
      Moulin! They tell me there never were such darling wild beasts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now really, are you mad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I should guide your youth, like a venerable patriarch, through
      the dangers of the Storm-blown Tulip, all well and good&mdash;I ran no
      risk of meeting my pastors and masters; but were I to take you to a Lent
      Spectacle (since there are only beasts to be seen), I might just run
      against my sacristans&mdash;and how pretty I should look with you on my
      arm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can put on a false nose, and straps to your trousers, my big
      Ninny; they will never know you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not think of false noses, but of what I have to tell you,
      since you assure me that you have no intrigue in hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, solemnly, extending her left
      hand horizontally, whilst with her right she put a nut into her mouth.
      Then she added, with surprise, as she looked at the outside coat of Ninny
      Moulin, &ldquo;Goodness gracious! what full pockets you have got! What is
      there in them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that concerns you, Rose-Pompon,&rdquo; said Dumoulin,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose-Pompon!&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, suddenly, with a majestic
      air; &ldquo;will you have a carriage? Will you inhabit a charming
      apartment, instead of living in this dreadful hole? Will you be dressed
      like a duchess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for some more nonsense! Come, will you eat the olives? If not,
      I shall eat them all up. There is only one left.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering this gastronomic offer, Ninny Moulin felt in one of his
      pockets, and drew from it a case containing a very pretty bracelet, which
      he held up sparkling before the eyes of the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a sumptuous bracelet!&rdquo; cried she, clapping her
      hands. &ldquo;A green-eyed serpent biting his tail&mdash;the emblem of my
      love for Philemon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not talk of Philemon; it annoys me,&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, as
      he clasped the bracelet round the wrist of Rose-Pompon, who allowed him to
      do it, laughing all the while like mad, and saying to him, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve
      been employed to make a purchase, big apostle, and wish to see the effect
      of it. Well! it is charming!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose-Pompon,&rdquo; resumed Ninny Moulin, &ldquo;would you like to
      have a servant, a box at the Opera, and a thousand francs a month for your
      pin-money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the same nonsense. Get along!&rdquo; said the young girl, as
      she held up the bracelet to the light, still continuing to eat her nuts.
      &ldquo;Why always the same farce, and no change of bills?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ninny Moulin again plunged his hand into his pocket, and this time drew
      forth an elegant chain, which he hung round Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a beautiful chain!&rdquo; cried the young girl, as she
      looked by turns at the sparkling ornament and the religious writer.
      &ldquo;If you chose that also, you have a very good taste. But am I not a
      good natured girl to be your dummy, just to show off your jewels?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose-Pompon,&rdquo; returned Ninny Moulin, with a still more
      majestic air, &ldquo;these trifles are nothing to what you may obtain, if
      you will but follow the advice of your old friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose began to look at Dumoulin with surprise, and said to him, &ldquo;What
      does all this mean, Ninny Moulin? Explain yourself; what advice have you
      to give?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumoulin did not answer, but replunging his hand into his inexhaustible
      pocket, he fished up a parcel, which he carefully unfolded, and in which
      was a magnificent mantilla of black lace. Rose-Pompon started up, full of
      new admiration, and Dumoulin threw the rich mantilla over the young girl&rsquo;s
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is superb! I have never seen anything like it! What patterns!
      what work!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, as she examined all with simple and
      perfectly disinterested curiosity. Then she added, &ldquo;Your pocket is
      like a shop; where did you get all these pretty things?&rdquo; Then,
      bursting into a fit of laughter, which brought the blood to her cheeks,
      she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, I have it! These are the wedding-presents for
      Madame de la Sainte-Colombe. I congratulate you; they are very choice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do you suppose I should find money to buy these wonders?&rdquo;
      said Ninny Moulin. &ldquo;I repeat to you, all this is yours if you will
      but listen to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, with the utmost amazement;
      &ldquo;is what you tell me in downright earnest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In downright earnest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This offer to make me a great lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jewels might convince you of the reality of my offers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you propose all this to me for some one else, my poor Ninny
      Moulin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said the religious writer, with a comical air of
      modesty, &ldquo;you must know me well enough, my beloved pupil, to feel
      certain that I should be incapable of inducing you to commit an improper
      action. I respect myself too much for that&mdash;leaving out the
      consideration that it would be unfair to Philemon, who confided to me the
      guardianship of your virtue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Ninny Moulin,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, more and more
      astonished, &ldquo;on my word of honor, I can make nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, &lsquo;tis all very simple, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve found it,&rdquo; cried Rose-Pompon, interrupting
      Ninny Moulin; &ldquo;it is some gentleman who offers me his hand, his
      heart, and all the rest of it. Could you not tell me that directly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A marriage? oh, laws, yes!&rdquo; said Dumoulin, shrugging his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is it not a marriage?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, again much
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the offers you make me are honest ones, my big apostle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They could not be more so.&rdquo; Here Dumoulin spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not have to be unfaithful to Philemon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or faithful to any one else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose-Pompon looked confounded. Then she rattled on: &ldquo;Come, do not
      let us have any joking! I am not foolish enough to imagine that I am to
      live just like a duchess, just for nothing. What, therefore, must I give
      in return?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even that,&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, biting his nail-tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress yourself as handsomely as possible, take your ease, amuse
      yourself, ride about in a carriage. You see, it is not very fatiguing&mdash;and
      you will, moreover, help to do a good action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! by living like a duchess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! so make up your mind. Do not ask me for any more details, for
      I cannot give them to you. For the rest, you will not be detained against
      your will. Just try the life I propose to you. If it suits you, go on with
      it; if not, return to your Philemonic household.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only try it. What can you risk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; but I can hardly believe that all you say is true. And
      then,&rdquo; added she, with hesitation, &ldquo;I do not know if I ought&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ninny Moulin went to the window, opened it, and said to Rose-Pompon, who
      ran up to it, &ldquo;Look there! before the door of the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pretty carriage! How comfortable a body&rsquo;d be inside of
      it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That carriage is yours. It is waiting for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for me!&rdquo; exclaimed Rose-Pompon; &ldquo;am I to decide
      as short as that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or not at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the instant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where will they take me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know where they will take me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo;&mdash;and Dumoulin still spoke the truth&mdash;&ldquo;the
      coachman has his orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know all this is very funny, Ninny Moulin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you. If it were not funny, where would be the pleasure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you accept the offer? That is well. I am delighted both for
      you and myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; because, in accepting, you render me a great service.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters little, as long as I feel obliged to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then; let us set out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! after all, they cannot eat me,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon,
      resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a skip and a jump, she went to fetch a rose-colored cap, and, going
      up to a broken looking-glass, placed the cap very much cocked on one side
      on her bands of light hair. This left uncovered her snowy neck, with the
      silky roots of the hair behind, and gave to her pretty face a very
      mischievous, not to say licentious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cloak!&rdquo; said she to Ninny Moulin, who seemed to be
      relieved from a considerable amount of uneasiness, since she had accepted
      his offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie! a cloak will not do,&rdquo; answered her companion, feeling
      once more in his pocket and drawing out a fine Cashmere shawl, which he
      threw over Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Cashmere!&rdquo; cried the young girl, trembling with pleasure
      and joyous surprise. Then she added, with an air of heroism: &ldquo;It is
      settled! I will run the gauntlet.&rdquo; And with a light step she
      descended the stairs, followed by Ninny Moulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy greengrocer was at her post. &ldquo;Good-morning, mademoiselle;
      you are early to-day,&rdquo; said she to the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mother Arsene; there is my key.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! now I think of it,&rdquo; said Rose Pompon, suddenly, in a
      whisper, as she turned towards Ninny Moulin, and withdrew further from the
      portress, &ldquo;what is to became of Philemon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philemon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he should arrive&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the devil!&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, scratching his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; if Philemon should arrive, what will they say to him? for I
      may be a long time absent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four months, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very good!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon. Then, turning towards the
      greengrocer, she said to her, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection: &ldquo;Mother
      Arsene, if Philemon should come home, you will tell him I have gone out&mdash;on
      business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that he must not forget to feed my pigeons, which are in his
      study.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mother Arsene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, mademoiselle.&rdquo; And Rose-Pompon entered the carriage
      in triumph, along with Ninny Moulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take me if I know what is to come of all this,&rdquo;
      said Jacques Dumoulin to himself, as the carriage drove rapidly down the
      Rue Clovis. &ldquo;I have repaired my error&mdash;and now I laugh at the
      rest.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII. ANOTHER SECRET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following scene
      took place a few days after the abduction of Rose Pompon by Ninny Moulin.
      Mdlle. de Cardoville was seated in a dreamy mood, in her cabinet, which
      was hung with green silk, and furnished with an ebony library, ornamented
      with large bronze caryatides. By some significant signs, one could
      perceive that Mdlle. de Cardoville had sought in the fine airs some relief
      from sad and serious thoughts. Near an open piano, was a harp, placed
      before a music-stand. A little further, on a table covered with boxes of
      oil and water-color, were several brilliant sketches. Most of them
      represented Asiatic scenes, lighted by the fires of an oriental sun.
      Faithful to her fancy of dressing herself at home in a picturesque style,
      Mademoiselle de Cardoville resembled that day one of those proud portraits
      of Velasquez, with stern and noble aspect. Her gown was of black moire,
      with wide swelling petticoat, long waist, and sleeve slashed with
      rose-colored satin, fastened together with jet bugles. A very stiff,
      Spanish ruff reached almost to her chin, and was secured round her neck by
      a broad rose-colored ribbon. This frill, slightly heaving, sloped down as
      far as the graceful swell of the rose-colored stomacher, laced with
      strings of jet beads, and terminating in a point at the waist. It is
      impossible to express how well this black garment, with its ample and
      shining folds, relieved with rose-color and brilliant jet, skin,
      harmonized with the shining whiteness of Adrienne&rsquo;s and the golden
      flood of her beautiful hair, whose long, silky ringlets descended to her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady was in a half-recumbent posture, with her elbow resting on
      a couch covered with green silk. The back of this piece of furniture,
      which was pretty high towards the fireplace, sloped down insensibly
      towards the foot. A sort of light, semicircular trellis-work, in gilded
      bronze, raised about five feet from the ground, covered with flowering
      plants (the admirable passiflores quadrangulatoe, planted in a deep ebony
      box, from the centre of which rose the trellis-work), surrounded this
      couch with a sort of screen of foliage enamelled with large flowers, green
      without, purple within, and as brilliant as those flowers of porcelain,
      which we receive from Saxony. A sweet, faint perfume, like a faint mixture
      of jasmine with violet, rose from the cup of these admirable passiflores.
      Strange enough, a large quantity of new books (Adrienne having bought them
      since the last two or three days) and quite fresh-cut, were scattered
      around her on the couch, and on a little table; whilst other larger
      volumes, amongst which were several atlases full of engravings, were piled
      on the sumptuous fur, which formed the carpet beneath the divan. Stranger
      still, these books, though of different forms, and by different authors,
      alt treated of the same subject. The posture of Adrienne revealed a sort
      of melancholy dejection. Her cheeks were pale; a light blue circle
      surrounded her large, black eyes, now half-closed, and gave to them an
      expression of profound grief. Many causes contributed to this sorrow&mdash;amongst
      others, the disappearance of Mother Bunch. Without absolutely believing
      the perfidious insinuations of Rodin, who gave her to understand that, in
      the fear of being unmasked by him, the hunchback had not dared to remain
      in the house, Adrienne felt a cruel sinking of the heart, when she thought
      how this young girl, in whom she had had so much confidence, had fled from
      her almost sisterly hospitality, without even uttering a word of
      gratitude; for care had been taken not to show her the few lines written
      by the poor needlewoman to her benefactress, just before her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had only been told of the note of five hundred francs found on her
      desk; and this last inexplicable circumstance had contributed to awaken
      cruel suspicions in the breast of Mdlle. de Cardoville. She already felt
      the fatal effects of that mistrust of everything and everybody, which
      Rodin had recommended to her; and this sentiment of suspicion and reserve
      had the more tendency to become powerful, that, for the first time in her
      life, Mdlle. de Cardoville, until then a stranger to all deception, had a
      secret to conceal&mdash;a secret, which was equally her happiness, her
      shame, and her torment. Half-recumbent on her divan, pensive and
      depressed, Adrienne pursued, with a mind often absent, one of her newly
      purchased books. Suddenly, she uttered an exclamation of surprise; the
      hand which held the book trembled like a leaf, and from that moment she
      appeared to read with passionate attention and devouring curiosity. Soon,
      her eyes sparkled with enthusiasm, her smile assumed ineffable sweetness,
      and she seemed at once proud, happy, delighted&mdash;but, as she turned
      over the last page, her countenance expressed disappointment and chagrin.
      Then she recommenced this reading, which had occasioned her such sweet
      emotion, and this time she read with the most deliberate slowness, going
      over each page twice, and spelling, as it were, every line, every word.
      From time to time, she paused, and in a pensive mood, with her forehead
      leaning on her fair hand, she seemed to reflect, in a deep reverie, on the
      passages she had read with such tender and religious love. Arriving at a
      passage which so affected her, that a tear started in her eye, she
      suddenly turned the volume, to see on the cover the name of the author.
      For a few seconds, she contemplated this name with a singular expression
      of gratitude, and could not forbear raising to her rosy lips the page on
      which it was printed. After reading many times over the lines with which
      she had been so much struck, forgetting, no doubt, the letter in the
      spirit, she began to reflect so deeply, that the book glided from her
      hand, and fell upon the carpet. During the course of this reverie, the
      eyes of the young girl rested, at first mechanically, upon an admirable
      bas-relief, placed on an ebony stand, near one of the windows. This
      magnificent bronze, recently cast after a plaster copy from the antique,
      represented the triumph of the Indian Bacchus. Never, perhaps, had Grecian
      art attained such rare perfection. The youthful conqueror, half clad in a
      lion&rsquo;s skin, which displayed his juvenile grace and charming purity
      of form shone with divine beauty. Standing up in a car, drawn by two
      tigers, with an air at once gentle and proud, he leaned with one hand upon
      a thyrsus, and with the other guided his savage steeds in tranquil
      majesty. By this rare mixture of grace, vigor, and serenity, it was easy
      to recognize the hero who had waged such desperate combats with men and
      with monsters of the forest. Thanks to the brownish tone of the figure,
      the light, falling from one side of the sculpture, admirably displayed the
      form of the youthful god, which, carved in relievo, and thus illumined,
      shone like a magnificent statue of pale gold upon the dark fretted
      background of the bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Adrienne&rsquo;s look first rested on this rare assemblage of divine
      perfections, her countenance was calm and thoughtful. But this
      contemplation, at first mechanical, became gradually more and more
      attentive and conscious, and the young lady, rising suddenly from her
      seat, slowly approached the bas-relief, as if yielding to the invincible
      attraction of an extraordinary resemblance. Then a slight blush appeared
      on the cheeks of Mdlle. de Cardoville, stole across her face, and spread
      rapidly to her neck and forehead. She approached still closer, threw round
      a hasty glance, as if half-ashamed, or as if she had feared to be
      surprised in a blamable action, and twice stretched forth her hand,
      trembling with emotion, to touch with the tips of her charming fingers the
      bronze forehead of the Indian Bacchus. And twice she stopped short, with a
      kind of modest hesitation. At last, the temptation became too strong for
      her. She yielded to it; and her alabaster finger, after delicately
      caressing the features of pale gold, was pressed more boldly for an
      instant on the pure and noble brow of the youthful god. At this pressure,
      though so slight, Adrienne seemed to feel a sort of electric shock; she
      trembled in every limb, her eyes languished, and, after swimming for an
      instant in their humid and brilliant crystal, were raised, half-closed, to
      heaven. Then her head was thrown a little way back, her knees bent
      insensibly, her rosy lips were half opened, as if to give a passage to her
      heated breath, for her bosom heaved violently, as thought youth and life
      had accelerated the pulsations of her heart, and made her blood boil in
      her veins. Finally, the burning cheeks of Adrienne betrayed a species of
      ecstasy, timid and passionate, chaste and sensual, the expression of which
      was ineffably touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      An affecting spectacle indeed is that of a young maiden, whose modest brow
      flushes with the first fires of a secret passion. Does not the Creator of
      all things animate the body as well as the soul, with a spark of divine
      energy? Should He not be religiously glorified in the intellect as in the
      senses, with which He has so paternally endowed His creatures? They are
      impious blasphemers who seek to stifle the celestial senses, instead of
      guiding and harmonizing them in their divine flight. Suddenly, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville started, raised her head, opened her eyes as if awakening from
      a dream, withdrew abruptly from the sculptures, and walked several times
      up and down the room in an agitated manner, pressing her burning hands to
      her forehead. Then, falling, as it were, exhausted on her seat, her tears
      flowed in abundance. The most bitter grief was visible in her features,
      which revealed the fatal struggle that was passing within her. By degrees,
      her tears ceased. To this crisis of painful dejection succeeded a species
      of violent scorn and indignation against herself, which were expressed by
      these words that escaped her: &ldquo;For the first time in my life, I feel
      weak and cowardly. Oh yes! cowardly&mdash;very cowardly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a door opening and closing, roused Mdlle. de Cardoville from
      her bitter reflections. Georgette entered the room, and said to her
      mistress: &ldquo;Madame, can you receive the Count de Montbron?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20533m.jpg" alt="20533m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20533.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Adrienne, too well-bred to exhibit before her women the sort of impatience
      occasioned by this unseasonable visit, said to Georgette: &ldquo;You told
      M. de Montbron that I was at home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then beg him to walk in.&rdquo; Though Mdlle. de Cardoville felt at
      that moment much vexed at the arrival of Montbron, let us hasten to say,
      that she entertained for him an almost filial affection, and a profound
      esteem, though, by a not unfrequent contrast, she almost always differed
      from him in opinion. Hence arose, when Mdlle. de Cardoville had nothing to
      disturb her mind, the most gay and animated discussions, in which M. de
      Montbron, notwithstanding his mocking and sceptical humor, his long
      experience, his rare knowledge of men and things, his fashionable
      training, in a word, had not always the advantage, and even acknowledged
      his defeat gayly enough. Thus, to give an idea of the differences of the
      count and Adrienne, before, as he would say laughingly, he had made
      himself her accomplice, he had always opposed (from other motives than
      those alleged by Madame de Saint-Dizier) Adrienne&rsquo;s wish to live
      alone and in her own way; whilst Rodin, on the contrary, by investing the
      young girl&rsquo;s resolve on this subject with an ideal grandeur of
      intention, had acquired a species of influence over her. M. de Montbron,
      now upwards of sixty years of age, had been a most prominent character
      during the Directory, Consulate, and the Empire. His prodigal style of
      living, his wit, his gayety, his duels, his amours, and his losses at
      play, had given him a leading influence in the best society of his day;
      while his character, his kind-heartedness, and liberality, secured him the
      lasting friendship of nearly all his female friends. At the time we now
      present him to the reader, he was still a great gambler; and, moreover, a
      very lucky gambler. He had, as we have stated, a very lordly style; his
      manners were decided, but polished and lively; his habits were such as
      belong to the higher classes of society, though he could be excessively
      sharp towards people whom he did not like. He was tall and thin, and his
      slim figure gave him an almost youthful appearance; his forehead was high,
      and a little bald; his hair was gray and short, his countenance long, his
      nose aquiline, his eyes blue and piercing, and his teeth white, and still
      very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count de Montbron,&rdquo; said Georgette, opening the door. The
      count entered, and hastened to kiss Adrienne&rsquo;s hand, with a sort of
      paternal familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said M. de Montbron to himself; &ldquo;let us try to
      discover the truth I am in search of, that we may escape a great
      misfortune.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII. THE CONFESSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>dlle. de
      Cardoville, not wishing to betray the cause of the violent feelings which
      agitated her, received M. de Montbron with a feigned and forced gayety. On
      the other hand, notwithstanding his tact and knowledge of the world, the
      count was much embarrassed how to enter upon the subject on which he
      wished to confer with Adrienne, and he resolved to feel his way, before
      seriously commencing the conversation. After looking at the young lady for
      some seconds, M. de Montbron shook his head, and said, with a sigh of
      regret: &ldquo;My dear child, I am not pleased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some affair of the heart, or of hearts, my dear count?&rdquo;
      returned Adrienne, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the heart,&rdquo; said M. de Montbron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you, so great a player, think more of a woman&rsquo;s whim
      than a throw of the dice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a heavy heart, and you are the cause of it, my dear child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Montbron, you will make me very proud,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be wrong, for I tell you plainly, my trouble is caused by
      your neglect of your beauty. Yes, your countenance is pale, dejected,
      sorrowful; you have been low-spirited for the last few days; you have
      something on your mind, I am sure of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear M. de Montbron, you have so much penetration, that you may
      be allowed to fall for once, as now. I am not sad, I have nothing on my
      mind, and&mdash;I am about to utter a very silly piece of impertinence&mdash;I
      have never thought myself so pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, nothing could be more modest than such an
      assertion. Who told you that falsehood? a woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it was my heart, and it spoke the truth,&rdquo; answered
      Adrienne, with a slight degree of emotion. &ldquo;Understand it, if you
      can,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you are proud of the alteration in your features,
      because you are proud of the sufferings of your heart?&rdquo; said M. de
      Montbron, looking at Adrienne with attention. &ldquo;Be it so; I am then
      right. You have some sorrow. I persist in it,&rdquo; added the count,
      speaking with a tone of real feeling, &ldquo;because it is painful to me.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied; I am as happy as possible&mdash;for every instant I
      take delight in repeating, how, at my age, I am free&mdash;absolutely
      free!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; free to torment yourself, free to be miserable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my dear count!&rdquo; said Adrienne, &ldquo;you are
      recommencing our old quarrel. I still find in you the ally of my aunt and
      the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; as the republicans are the allies of the legitimists&mdash;to
      destroy each other in their turn. Talking of your abominable aunt, they
      say that she holds a sort of council at her house these last few days, a
      regular mitred conspiracy. She is certainly in a good way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Formerly, she would have wished to be Goddess of Reason,
      now, we shall perhaps see her canonized. She has already performed the
      first part of the life of Mary Magdalen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can never speak worse of her than she deserves, my dear child.
      Still, though for quite opposite reasons, I agreed with her on the subject
      of your wish to reside alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and because I wished to see you a thousand times freer than
      you really are, I advised you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; you would have had your dear liberty, with its
      consequences, only, instead of Mdlle. de Cardoville, we should have called
      you Madame Somebody, having found an excellent husband to be responsible
      for your independence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who would have been responsible for this ridiculous husband?
      And who would bear a mocked and degraded name? I, perhaps?&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, with animation. &ldquo;No, no, my dear count, good or ill, I
      will answer for my own actions; to my name shall attach the reputation,
      which I alone have formed. I am as incapable of basely dishonoring a name
      which is not mine, as of continually bearing it myself, if it were not
      held in, esteem. And, as one can only answer for one&rsquo;s own actions,
      I prefer to keep my name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the only person in the world that has such ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Adrienne, laughing. &ldquo;Because it appears to
      me horrible, to see a poor girl lost and buried in some ugly and selfish
      man, and become, as they say seriously, the better half of the monster&mdash;yes!
      a fresh and blooming rose to become part of a frightful thistle!&mdash;Come,
      my dear count; confess there is something odious in this conjugal
      metempsychosis,&rdquo; added Adrienne, with a burst of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forced and somewhat feverish gayety of Adrienne contrasted painfully
      with her pale and suffering countenance; it was so easy to see that she
      strove to stifle with laughter some deep sorrow, that M. de Montbron was
      much affected by it; but, dissembling his emotion, he appeared to reflect
      a moment, and took up mechanically one of the new, fresh-cut books, by
      which Adrienne was surrounded. After casting a careless glance at this
      volume, he continued, still dissembling his feelings: &ldquo;Come, my dear
      madcap: this is another folly. Suppose I were twenty years old, and that
      you did me the honor to marry me&mdash;you would be called Lady de
      Montbron, I imagine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perhaps? Would you not bear my name, if you married me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a smile, &ldquo;do not
      let us pursue this hypothesis, which can only leave us&mdash;regrets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, M. de Montbron started, and looked at Mdlle, de Cardoville with
      an expression of surprise. For some moments, whilst talking to Adrienne,
      he had mechanically&mdash;taken up two or three of the volumes scattered
      over the couch, and had glanced at their titles in the same careless
      manner. The first was the &ldquo;Modern History of India.&rdquo; The
      second, &ldquo;Travels in India.&rdquo; The third, &ldquo;Letters on
      India.&rdquo; Much surprised, M. de Montbron had continued his
      investigation, and found that the fourth volume continued this Indian
      nomenclature, being &ldquo;Rambles in India.&rdquo; The fifth was, &ldquo;Recollections
      of Hindostan.&rdquo; The sixth, &ldquo;Notes of a Traveller in the East
      Indies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the astonishment, which, for many serious reasons, M. de Montbron
      had no longer been able to conceal, and which his looks betrayed to
      Adrienne. The latter, having completely forgotten the presence of the
      accusing volumes by which she was surrounded, yielded to a movement of
      involuntary confusion, and blushed slightly; but, her firm and resolute
      character again coming to her aid, she looked full at M. de Montbron, and
      said to him: &ldquo;Well, my dear count! what surprises you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, M. de Montbron appeared still more absorbed in
      thought, and contemplating the young girl, he could not forbear saying to
      himself: &ldquo;No, no&mdash;it is impossible&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would, perhaps, be indiscreet in me to listen to your soliloquy,
      my dear count,&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, my dear child; but what I see surprises me so much&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what do you see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The traces of so great and novel an interest in all that relates to
      India,&rdquo; said M. de Montbron, laying a slight stress on his words,
      and fixing a piercing look upon the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Adrienne, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I seek the cause of this sudden passion&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geographical?&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, interrupting M. de
      Montbron: &ldquo;you may find this taste somewhat serious for my age my
      dear count&mdash;but one must find occupation for leisure hours&mdash;and
      then, having a cousin, who is both an Indian and a prince, I should like
      to know something of the fortunate country from which I derive this savage
      relationship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These last words were pronounced with a bitterness that was not lost on M.
      de Montbron: watching Adrienne attentively, he observed: &ldquo;Meseems,
      you speak of the prince with some harshness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I speak of him with indifference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet he deserves a very different feeling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the part of some other person, perhaps,&rdquo; replied Adrienne,
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so unhappy!&rdquo; said M, de Montbron, in a tone of sincere
      pity. &ldquo;When I saw him the other day, he made my heart ache.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I to do with it?&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, with an
      accent of painful and almost angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that his cruel torments at least deserved
      your pity,&rdquo; answered the count gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity&mdash;from me!&rdquo; cried Adrienne, with an air of offended
      pride. Then restraining herself, she added coldly: &ldquo;You are jesting,
      M. de Montbron. It is not in sober seriousness that you ask me to take
      interest in the amorous torments of your prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much cold disdain in these last words of Adrienne, her pale
      and agitated countenance betrayed such haughty bitterness, that M. de
      Montbron said, sorrowfully: &ldquo;It is then true; I have not been
      deceived. I, who thought, from our old and constant friendship, that I had
      some claim to your confidence have known nothing of it&mdash;while you
      told all to another. It is painful, very painful to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, M. de Montbron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, since I must speak plainly,&rdquo; cried the count,
      &ldquo;there is, I see, no hope for this unhappy boy&mdash;you love
      another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Adrienne started&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! you cannot deny it,&rdquo; resumed
      the count; &ldquo;your paleness and melancholy for the last few days, your
      implacable indifference to the prince&mdash;all prove to me that you are
      in love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurt by the manner in which the count spoke of the sentiment he attributed
      to her, Mdlle. de Cardoville answered with dignified stateliness: &ldquo;You
      must know, M. de Montbron, that a secret discovered is not a confidence.
      Your language surprises me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear friend, if I use the poor privilege of experience&mdash;if
      I guess that you are in love&mdash;if I tell you so, and even go so far as
      to reproach you with it&mdash;it is because the life or death of this poor
      prince is concerned; and I feel for him as if he were my son, for it is
      impossible to know him without taking the warmest interest in him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be singular,&rdquo; returned Adrienne, with redoubled
      coldness, and still more bitter irony, &ldquo;if my love&mdash;admitting I
      were in love&mdash;could have any such strange influence on Prince Djalma.
      What can it matter to him?&rdquo; added she, with almost agonizing
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it matter to him? Now really, my dear friend, permit me to
      tell you, that it is you who are jesting cruelly. What! this unfortunate
      youth loves you with all the blind ardor of a first love&mdash;twice has
      attempted to terminate by suicide the horrible tortures of his passion&mdash;and
      you think it strange that your love for another should be with him a
      question of life or death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves me then?&rdquo; cried the young girl, with an accent
      impossible to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves you to madness, I tell you; I have seen it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne seemed overcome with amazement. From pale, she became crimson; as
      the redness disappeared, her lips grew white, and trembled. Her emotion
      was so strong, that she remained for some moments unable to speak, and
      pressed her hand to her heart, as if to moderate its pulsations.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Montbron, almost frightened at the sudden change in Adrienne&rsquo;s
      countenance, hastily approached her, exclaiming: &ldquo;Good heaven, my
      poor child! what is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, Adrienne waved her hand to him, in sign that he
      should not be alarmed; and, in fact, the count was speedily tranquillized,
      for the beautiful face, which had so lately been contracted with pain,
      irony, and scorn, seemed now expressive of the sweetest and most ineffable
      emotions; Adrienne appeared to luxuriate in delight, and to fear losing
      the least particle of it; then, as reflection told her, that she was,
      perhaps, the dupe of illusion or falsehood, she exclaimed suddenly, with
      anguish, addressing herself to M. de Montbron: &ldquo;But is what you tell
      me true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I tell you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that Prince Djalma&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loves you to madness?&mdash;Alas! it is only too true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Adrienne, with a charming expression of
      simplicity; &ldquo;that could never be too true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cried the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that woman?&rdquo; asked Adrienne, as if the word scorched her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She who has been the cause of all these painful struggles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman&mdash;why, who should it be but you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, I? Oh! tell me, was it I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word of honor. I trust my experience. I have never seen so
      ardent and sincere a passion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is it really so? Has he never had any other love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I was told so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Djalma&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had fallen violently in love, two days after I saw him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin told you that!&rdquo; cried M. de Montbron, as if struck
      with a sudden idea. &ldquo;Why, it is he who told Djalma that you were in
      love with some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this it was which occasioned the poor youth&rsquo;s dreadful
      despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this which occasioned my despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love him, then, just as he loves you!&rdquo; exclaimed M. de
      Montbron, transported with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him!&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville. A discreet knock at the
      door interrupted Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your servants, no doubt. Be calm,&rdquo; said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Adrienne, in an agitated voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville. Florine entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin has just been here. Fearing to disturb mademoiselle, he
      would not come in; but he will return in half an hour. Will mademoiselle
      receive him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the count to Florine; &ldquo;even if I am
      still here, show him in by all means. Is not that your opinion?&rdquo;
      asked M. de Montbron of Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; answered the young girl; and a flash of
      indignation darted from her eyes, as she thought of Rodin&rsquo;s perfidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! the old knave!&rdquo; said M. de Montbron, &ldquo;I always had
      my doubts of that crooked neck!&rdquo; Florine withdrew, leaving the count
      with her mistress.

      CHAPTER IX. LOVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>dlle. de
      Cardoville was transfigured. For the first time her beauty shone forth in
      all its lustre. Until now overshadowed by indifference, or darkened by
      grief, she appeared suddenly illumined by a brilliant ray of sunshine. The
      slight irritation caused by Rodin&rsquo;s perfidy passed like an
      imperceptible shade from her brow. What cared she now for falsehood and
      perfidy? Had they not failed? And, for the future, what human power could
      interpose between her and Djalma, so sure of each other? Who would dare to
      cross the path of those two things, resolute and strong with the
      irresistible power of youth, love, and liberty? Who would dare to follow
      them into that blazing sphere, whither they went, so beautiful and happy,
      to blend together in their inextinguishable love, protected by the proof
      armor of their own happiness? Hardly had Florine left the room, when
      Adrienne approached M. de Montbron with a rapid step. She seemed to have
      become taller; and to watch her advancing, light, radiant, and triumphant,
      one might have fancied her a goddess walking upon clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I see him?&rdquo; was her first word to M. de Montbron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;say to-morrow; he must be prepared for so much
      happiness; in so ardent a nature, such sudden, unexpected joy might be
      terrible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne remained pensive for a moment, and then said rapidly: &ldquo;To
      morrow&mdash;yes&mdash;not before to-morrow. I have a superstition of the
      heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know. HE LOVES ME&mdash;that word says all, contains all,
      comprehends all, is all&mdash;and yet I have a thousand questions to ask
      with regard to him&mdash;but I will ask none before to-morrow, because, by
      a mysterious fatality, to-morrow is with me a sacred anniversary. It will
      be an age till then; but happily, I can wait. Look here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beckoning M. de Montbron, she led him to the Indian Bacchus. &ldquo;How
      much it is like him!&rdquo; said she to the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed the latter, &ldquo;it is strange!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange?&rdquo; returned Adrienne, with a smile of gentle pride;
      &ldquo;strange, that a hero, a demi-god, an ideal of beauty, should
      resemble Djalma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you love him!&rdquo; said M. de Montbron, deeply touched, and
      almost dazzled by the felicity which beamed from the countenance of
      Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have suffered a good deal, do you not think so?&rdquo; said
      she, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had not made up my mind to come here to-day, almost in
      despair, what would have happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell; I should perhaps have died, for I am wounded
      mortally here&rdquo;&mdash;she pressed her hand to her heart. &ldquo;But
      what might have been death to me, will now be life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was horrible,&rdquo; said the count, shuddering. &ldquo;Such a
      passion, buried in your own breast, proud as you are&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, proud&mdash;but not self-conceited. When I learned his love
      for another, and that the impression which I fancied I had made on him at
      our first interview had been immediately effaced, I renounced all hope,
      without being able to renounce my love. Instead of shunning his image, I
      surrounded myself with all that could remind me of him. In default of
      happiness, there is a bitter pleasure in suffering through what we love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can now understand your Indian library.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering the count, Adrienne took from the stand one of the
      freshly-cut volumes, and, bringing it to M. de Montbron, said to him, with
      a smile and a celestial expression of joy and happiness: &ldquo;I was
      wrong&mdash;I am vain. Just read this&mdash;aloud, if you please. I tell
      you that I can wait for to-morrow.&rdquo; Presenting the book to the
      count, she pointed out one passage with the tip of her charming finger.
      Then she sank down upon the couch, and, in an attitude of deep attention,
      with her body bent forward, her hands crossed upon the cushion, her chin
      resting upon her hands, her large eyes fixed with a sort of adoration on
      the Indian Bacchus, that was just opposite to her, she appeared by this
      impassioned contemplation to prepare herself to listen to M. de Montbron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, much astonished, began to read, after again looking at
      Adrienne, who said to him, in her most coaxing voice, &ldquo;Very slowly,
      I beg of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Montbron then read the following passage from the journal of a
      traveller in India: &ldquo;&lsquo;When I was at Bombay, in 1829, I
      constantly heard amongst the English there, of a young hero, the son of&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The count having paused a second, by reason of the barbarous spelling of
      the name of Djalma&rsquo;s father, Adrienne immediately said to him, in
      her soft voice: &ldquo;The son of Kadja-sing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/20551m.jpg" alt="20551m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/20551.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a memory!&rdquo; said the count, with a smile. And he resumed:
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A young hero, the son of Kadja-sing, king of Mundi. On his
      return from a distant and sanguinary expedition amongst the mountains
      against this Indian king, Colonel Drake was filled with enthusiasm for
      this son of Kadja-sing, known as Djalma. Hardly beyond the age of
      childhood, this young prince has in the course of this implacable war
      given proofs of such chivalrous intrepidity, and of so noble a character,
      that his father has been surnamed the Father of the Generous.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a touching custom,&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;To
      recompense the father, as it were, by giving him a surname in honor of his
      son, is a great idea. But how strange you should have met with this book!&rdquo;
      added the count, in surprise. &ldquo;I can understand; there is matter
      here to inflame the coolest head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you will see, you will see,&rdquo; said Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count continued to read: &ldquo;&lsquo;Colonel Drake, one of the
      bravest and best officers of the English army, said yesterday, in my
      presence, that having been dangerously wounded, and taken prisoner by
      Prince Djalma, after an energetic resistance, he had been conveyed to the
      camp established in the village of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was the same hesitation on the part of the count, on seeing a
      still more barbarous name than the first; so, not wishing to try the
      adventure, he paused, and said to Adrienne, &ldquo;Now really, I give this
      up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it is so easy!&rdquo; replied Adrienne; and she pronounced
      with inexpressible softness, a name in itself soft, &ldquo;The village of
      Shumshabad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to have an infallible process for remembering
      geographical names,&rdquo; said the count, continuing: &ldquo;&lsquo;Once
      arrived at the camp, Colonel Drake received the kindest hospitality, and
      Prince Djalma treated him with the respect of a son. It was there that the
      colonel became acquainted with some facts, which carried to the highest
      pitch his enthusiasm for prince Djalma. I heard him relate the two
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In one of the battles, the prince was accompanied by a young
      Indian of about twelve years of age, whom he loved tenderly, and who
      served him as a page, following him on horseback to carry his spare
      weapons. This child was idolized by its mother; just as they set out on
      the expedition, she had entrusted her son to Prince Djalma&rsquo;s care,
      saying, with a stoicism worthy of antiquity, &ldquo;Let him be your
      brother.&rdquo; &ldquo;He shall be my brother,&rdquo; had replied the
      prince. In the height of a disastrous defeat, the child is severely
      wounded, and his horse killed; the prince, at peril of his life,
      notwithstanding the perception of a forced retreat, disengages him, and
      places him on the croup of his own horse; they are pursued; a musket-ball
      strikes their steed, who is just able to reach a jungle, in the midst of
      which, after some vain efforts, he falls exhausted. The child is unable to
      walk, but the prince carries him in his arms, and hides with him in the
      thickest part of the jungle. The English arrive, and begin their search;
      but the two victims escape. After a night and a day of marches,
      counter-marches, stratagems, fatigues, unheard-of perils, the prince,
      still, carrying the child, one of whose legs is broken, arrives at his
      father&rsquo;s camp, and says, with the utmost simplicity, &ldquo;I had
      promised his mother that I would act a brother&rsquo;s part by him&mdash;and
      I have done so.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is admirable!&rdquo; cried the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;pray go on!&rdquo; said Adrienne, drying a tear,
      without removing her eyes from the bas-relief, which she continued to
      contemplate with growing adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count continued: &ldquo;&lsquo;Another time, Prince Djalma, followed
      by two black slaves, went, before sunrise, to a very wild spot, to seize a
      couple of tiger cubs only a few days old. The den had been previously
      discovered. The two old tigers were still abroad. One of the blacks
      entered the den by a narrow aperture; the other, aided by Djalma, cut down
      a tolerably large tree, to prepare a trap for one of the old tigers. On
      the side of the aperture, the cavern was exceedingly steep. The prince
      mounted to the top of it with agility, to set his trap, with the aid of
      the other black. Suddenly, a dreadful roar was heard; and, in a few
      bounds, the tigress, returning from the chase, reached the opening of the
      den. The black who was laying the trap with the prince had his skull
      fractured by her bite; the tree, falling across the entrance, prevented
      the female from penetrating the cavern, and at the same time stopped the
      exit of the black who had seized the cubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;About twenty feet higher, upon a ledge of rock, the prince
      lay flat on the ground, looking down upon this frightful spectacle. The
      tigress, rendered furious by the cries of her little ones, gnawed the
      hands of the black, who, from the interior of the den, strove to support
      the trunk of the tree, his only rampart, whilst he uttered the most
      lamentable outcries.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is horrible!&rdquo; said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! go on! pray go on!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, with excitement;
      &ldquo;you will see what can be achieved by the heroism of goodness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The count pursued: &ldquo;&lsquo;Suddenly the prince seized his dagger
      between his teeth, fastened his sash to a block of stone, took his axe in
      one hand, and with the other slid down this substitute for a rope; falling
      a few steps from the wild beast, he sprang upon her, and, swift as
      lightning, dealt her two mortal strokes, just as the black, losing his
      strength, was about to drop the trunk of the tree, sure to have been torn
      to pieces.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are astonished at his resemblance with the demi-god, to
      whom fable itself ascribes no more generous devotion!&rdquo; cried the
      young lady, with still increasing excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished no longer, I only admire,&rdquo; said the count, in
      a voice of emotion; &ldquo;and, at these two noble instances of heroism,
      my heart beats with enthusiasm, as if I were still twenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the noble heart of this traveller beat like yours at the
      recital,&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;you will see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What renders so admirable the intrepidity of the prince, is,
      that, according to the principle of Indian castes, the life of a slave is
      of no importance; thus a king&rsquo;s son, risking his life for the safety
      of a poor creature, so generally despised, obeyed an heroic and truly
      Christian instinct of charity, until then unheard of in this country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Two such actions,&rsquo; said Colonel Drake, with good
      reason, &lsquo;are sufficient to paint the man; it is with a feeling of
      profound respect and admiration, therefore, that I, an obscure traveller,
      have written the name of Prince Djalma in my book; and at the same time, I
      have experienced a kind of sorrow, when I have asked myself what would be
      the future fate of this prince, buried in the depths of a savage country,
      always devastated by war. However humble may be the homage that I pay to
      this character, worthy of the heroic age, his name will at least be
      repeated with generous enthusiasm by all those who have hearts that beat
      in sympathy with what is great and noble.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just now, when I read those simple and touching lines,&rdquo;
      resumed Adrienne, &ldquo;I could not forbear pressing my lips to the name
      of the traveller.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is such as I thought him,&rdquo; cried the count, with
      still more emotion, as he returned the book to Adrienne, who rose, with a
      grave and touching air, and said to him: &ldquo;It was thus I wished you
      to know him, that you might understand my adoration; for this courage,
      this heroic goodness, I had guessed beforehand, when I was an involuntary
      listener to his conversation. From that moment, I knew him to be generous
      as intrepid, tender and sensitive as energetic and resolute; and when I
      saw him so marvellously beautiful&mdash;so different, in the noble
      character of his countenance, and even in the style of his garments, from
      all I had hitherto met with&mdash;when I saw the impression that I made
      upon him, and which I perhaps felt still more violently&mdash;I knew that
      my whole life was bound up with his love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, what are your plans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divine, radiant as my heart. When he learns his happiness, I wish
      that Djalma should feel dazzled as I do, so as to prevent my gazing on my
      sun; for I repeat, that until tomorrow will be a century to me. Yes, it is
      strange! I should have thought that after such a discovery, I should feel
      the want of being left alone, plunged in an ocean of delicious dreams. But
      no! from this time till to-morrow&mdash;I dread solitude&mdash;I feel a
      kind of feverish impatience&mdash;uneasy&mdash;ardent&mdash;Oh! where is
      the beneficent fairy, that, touching me with her wand, will lull me into
      slumber till to-morrow!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be that beneficent fairy,&rdquo; said the count, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The power of my wand is this: I will relieve you from a portion of
      your thoughts by making them materially visible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray explain yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my plan will have another advantage for you. Listen to me; you
      are so happy now that you can hear anything. Your odious aunt, and her
      equally odious friends, are spreading the report that your residence with
      Dr. Baleinier&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was rendered necessary by the derangement of my mind,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, with a smile; &ldquo;I expected that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is stupid enough; but, as your resolution to live alone makes
      many envious of you, and many hostile, you must feel that there will be no
      want of persons ready to believe the most absurd calumny possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope as much. To pass for mad in the eyes of fools is very
      flattering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but to prove to fools that they are fools, and that in the
      face of all Paris, is much more amusing. Now, people begin to talk of your
      absence; you have given up your daily rides; for some time my niece has
      appeared alone in our box at the Opera; you wish to kill the time till
      to-morrow&mdash;well! here is an excellent opportunity. It is two o&rsquo;clock;
      at halfpast three, my niece will come in the carriage; the weather is
      splendid; there is sure to be a crowd in the Bois de Boulogne. You can
      take a delightful ride, and be seen by everybody. Then, as the air and
      movement will have calmed your fever of happiness, I will commence my
      magic this evening, and take you to India.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To India?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the midst of one of those wild forests, in which roar the
      lion, the panther, and the tiger. We will have this heroic combat, which
      so moved you just now, under our own eyes, in all its terrible reality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear count, you must be joking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; I promise to show you real wild beasts, formidable
      tenants of the country of our demigod&mdash;growling tigers&mdash;roaring
      lions&mdash;do you not think that will be better than books?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! I must give you the secret of my supernatural power. On
      returning from your ride, you shall dine with my niece, and we will go
      together to a very curious spectacle now exhibiting at the
      Porte-Saint-Martin Theatre. A most extraordinary lion-tamer there shows
      you a number of wild beasts, in a state of nature, in the midst of a
      forest (here only commences the illusion), and has fierce combats with
      them all&mdash;tigers, lions, and panthers. All Paris is crowding to these
      representations, and all Paris will see you there, more charming than
      ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your offer,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with childish delight.
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right. I feel a strange pleasure in beholding these
      ferocious monsters, who will remind me of those that my demi-god so
      heroically overcame. I accept also, because, for the first time in my
      life, I am anxious to be admired&mdash;even by everybody. I accept finally
      because&mdash;&rdquo; Here Mdlle. de Cardoville was interrupted by a low
      knock at the door, and by the entrance of Florine, who announced M. Rodin.

      CHAPTER X. THE EXECUTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>odin entered. A
      rapid glance at Mdlle. de Cardoville and M. de Montbron told him at once
      that he was in a dilemma. In fact, nothing could be less encouraging than
      the faces of Adrienne and the count. The latter, when he disliked people,
      exhibited his antipathy, as we have already said, by an impertinently
      aggressive manner, which had before now occasioned a good number of duels.
      At sight of Rodin, his countenance at once assumed a harsh and insolent
      expression; resting his elbow on the chimney-piece, and conversing with
      Adrienne, he looked disdainfully over his shoulder, without taking the
      least notice of the Jesuit&rsquo;s low bow. On the other hand, at sight of
      this man, Mdlle. de Cardoville almost felt surprise, that she should
      experience no movement of anger or hatred. The brilliant flame which
      burned in her heart, purified it from every vindictive sentiment. She
      smiled, on the contrary; for, glancing with gentle pride at the Indian
      Bacchus, and then at herself, she asked herself what two beings, so young,
      and fair, and free, and loving, could have to fear from this old, sordid
      man, with his ignoble and base countenance, now advancing towards her with
      the writhing of a reptile. In a word, far from feeling anger or aversion
      with regard to Rodin, the young lady seemed full of the spirit of mocking
      gayety, and her large eyes, already lighted up with happiness, now
      sparkled with irony and mischief. Rodin felt himself ill at ease. People
      of his stamp greatly prefer violent to mocking enemies. They can encounter
      bursts of rage&mdash;sometimes by falling on their knees, weeping,
      groaning, and beating their breasts&mdash;sometimes by turning on their
      adversary, armed and implacable. But they are easily disconcerted by
      biting raillery; and thus it was with Rodin. He saw that between Adrienne
      de Cardoville and M. de Montbron, he was about to be placed in what is
      vulgarly termed a &ldquo;regular fix.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The count opened the fire; still glancing over his shoulder, he said to
      Rodin: &ldquo;Ah! you are here, my benevolent gentleman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, draw a little nearer,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a
      mocking smile. &ldquo;Best of friends and model of philosophers&mdash;as
      well as declared enemy of all fraud and falsehood&mdash;I have to pay you
      a thousand compliments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accent anything from you, my dear young lady, even though
      undeserved,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, trying to smile, and thus exposing his
      vile yellow teeth; &ldquo;but may I be informed how I have earned these
      compliments?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your penetration, sir, which is rare&mdash;&rdquo; replied
      Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your veracity, sir,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;which is
      perhaps no less rare&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what have I exhibited my penetration, my dear young lady?&rdquo;
      said Rodin, coldly. &ldquo;In what my veracity?&rdquo; added he, turning
      towards M. de Montbron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what, sir?&rdquo; said Adrienne. &ldquo;Why, you have guessed a
      secret surrounded by difficulties and mystery. In a word, you have known
      how to read the depths of a woman&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, my dear young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir! rejoice at it, for your penetration has had the most
      fortunate results.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your veracity has worked wonders,&rdquo; added the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pleasant to do good, even without knowing it,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, still acting on the defensive, and throwing side glances by turns
      on the count and Adrienne; &ldquo;but will you inform me what it is that
      deserves this praise&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gratitude obliges me to inform you of it,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      maliciously; &ldquo;you have discovered, and told Prince Djalma, that I
      was passionately in love. Well! I admire your penetration; it was true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have also discovered, and told this lady, that Prince Djalma
      was passionately in love,&rdquo; resumed the count. &ldquo;Well! I admire
      your penetration, my dear sir; it was true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked confused, and at a loss for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person that I loved so passionately,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      &ldquo;was the prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person that the prince loved so passionately,&rdquo; resumed
      the count, &ldquo;was this lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These revelations, so sudden and alarming, almost stunned Rodin; he
      remained mute and terrified, thinking of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand now, sir, the extent of our gratitude towards
      you?&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, in a still more mocking tone. &ldquo;Thanks
      to your sagacity, thanks to the touching interest you take in us, the
      prince and I are indebted to you for the knowledge of our mutual
      sentiments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit had now gradually recovered his presence of mind, and his
      apparent calmness greatly irritated M. de Montbron, who, but for Adrienne&rsquo;s
      presence, would have assumed another tone than jests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some mistake,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;in what you have
      done me the honor to tell me, my dear young lady. I have never in my life
      spoken of the sentiments, however worthy and respectable, that you may
      entertain for Prince Djalma&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied Adrienne; &ldquo;with scrupulous and
      exquisite discretion, whenever you spoke to me of the deep love felt by
      Prince Djalma, you carried your reserve and delicacy so far as to inform
      me that it was not I whom he loved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the same scruple induced you to tell the prince that Mdlle. de
      Cardoville loved some one passionately&mdash;but that he was not the
      person,&rdquo; added the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Rodin, dryly, &ldquo;I need hardly tell you
      that I have no desire to mix myself up with amorous intrigues.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! this is either pride or modesty,&rdquo; said the count,
      insolently. &ldquo;For your own interest, pray do not advance such things;
      for, if we took you at your word, and it became known, it might injure
      some of the nice little trades that you carry on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one at least,&rdquo; said Rodin, drawing himself up as
      proudly as M. de Montbron, &ldquo;whose rude apprenticeship I shall owe to
      you. It is the wearisome one of listening to your discourse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, my good sir!&rdquo; replied the count,
      disdainfully: &ldquo;you force me to remind you that there are more ways
      than one of chastising impudent rogues.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear count!&rdquo; said Adrienne to M. de Montbron, with an air
      of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      With perfect coolness, Rodin replied: &ldquo;I do not exactly see, sir,
      first, what courage is shown by threatening a poor old man like myself,
      and, secondly&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin,&rdquo; said the count, interrupting the Jesuit, &ldquo;first,
      a poor old man like you, who does evil under the shelter of the age he
      dishonors, is both cowardly and wicked, and deserves a double
      chastisement; secondly, with regard to this question of age, I am not
      aware that gamekeepers and policemen bow down respectfully to the gray
      coats of old wolves, and the gray hairs of old thieves. What do you think,
      my good sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still impassible, Rodin raised his flabby eyelids, fixed for hardly a
      second his little reptile eye upon the count, and darted at him one of his
      rapid, cold, and piercing glances&mdash;and then the livid eyelid again
      covered the dull eye of that corpse-like face.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20559.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not having the disadvantage of being an old wolf, and still less an
      old thief,&rdquo; said Rodin, quietly, &ldquo;you will permit me, sir, to
      take no account of the pursuit of hunters and police. As for the
      reproaches made me, I have a very simple method of answering&mdash;I do
      not say of justifying myself&mdash;I never justify myself&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; resumed Rodin coolly; &ldquo;my acts are sufficient
      for that. I will then simply answer that seeing the deep, violent, almost
      fearful impression made by this lady on the prince&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let this assurance which you give me of the prince&rsquo;s love,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne interrupting Rodin with an enchanting smile, &ldquo;absolve
      you of all the evil you wished to do me. The sight of our happiness be
      your only punishment!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be that I need neither absolution nor punishment, for, as I
      have already had the honor to observe to the count, my dear young lady,
      the future will justify my acts. Yes; it was my duty to tell the prince
      that you loved another than himself, and to tell you that he loved another
      than yourself&mdash;all in your mutual interest. That my attachment for
      you may have misled me, is possible&mdash;I am not infallible; but, after
      my past conduct towards you, my dear young lady, I have, perhaps, some
      right to be astonished at seeing myself thus treated. This is not a
      complaint. If I never justify myself, I never complain either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now really, there is something heroic in all this, my good sir,&rdquo;
      said the count. &ldquo;You do not condescend to complain or justify
      yourself, with regard to the evil you have done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evil I have done?&rdquo; said Rodin, looking fixedly at the
      count. &ldquo;Are we playing at enigmas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir!&rdquo; cried the count, with indignation: &ldquo;is it
      nothing, by your falsehoods, to have plunged the prince into so frightful
      a state of despair, that he has twice attempted his life? Is it nothing,
      by similar falsehoods, to have induced this lady to believe so cruel and
      complete an error, that but for the resolution I have to-day taken, it
      might have led to the most fatal consequences?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you do me the honor to tell me, sir, what interest I could
      have in all this despair and error, admitting even that I had wished to
      produce them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some great interest no doubt,&rdquo; said the count, bluntly;
      &ldquo;the more dangerous that it is concealed. You are one of those, I
      see, to whom the woes of others are pleasure and profit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is really too much, sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, bowing; &ldquo;I
      should be quite contented with the profit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your impudent coolness will not deceive me; this is a serious
      matter,&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;It is impossible that so perfidious
      a piece of roguery can be an isolated act. Who knows but this may still be
      one of the fruits of Madame de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s hatred for Mdlle. de
      Cardoville?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne had listened to the preceding discussion with deep attention.
      Suddenly she started, as if struck by a sudden revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, she said to Rodin, without anger, without
      bitterness, but with an expression of gentle and serene calmness: &ldquo;We
      are told, sir, that happy love works miracles. I should be tempted to
      believe it; for, after some minutes&rsquo; reflection, and when I recall
      certain circumstances, your conduct appears to me in quite a new light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may this new perspective be, my dear young lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may see it from my point of view, sir, allow me to remind
      you of a few facts. That sewing-girl was generously devoted to me; she had
      given me unquestionable proofs of her attachment. Her mind was equal to
      her noble heart; but she had an invincible dislike to you. All on a sudden
      she disappears mysteriously from my house, and you do your best to cast
      upon her odious suspicions. M. de Montbron has a paternal affection for
      me; but, as I must confess, little sympathy for you; and you have always
      tried to produce a coldness between us. Finally, Prince Djalma has a deep
      affection for me, and you employ the most perfidious treachery to kill
      that sentiment within him. For what end do you act thus? I do not know;
      but certainly with some hostile design.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me, madame,&rdquo; said Rodin, severely, &ldquo;that
      you have forgotten services performed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny, sir, that you took me from the house of Dr.
      Baleinier; but, a few days sooner or later, I must infallibly have been
      released by M. de Montbron.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear child,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;it may
      be that your enemies wished to claim the merit of what must necessarily
      have happened through the exertions of your friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are drowning, and I save you&mdash;it is all a mistake to feel
      grateful,&rdquo; said Rodin, bitterly; &ldquo;some one else would no doubt
      have saved you a little later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The comparison is wanting in exactness,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with
      a smile; &ldquo;a lunatic asylum is not a river, and though, from what I
      see, I think you quite capable of diving, you have had no occasion to swim
      on this occasion. You merely opened a door for me, which would have opened
      of itself a little later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, my dear child!&rdquo; said the count, laughing heartily
      at Adrienne&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, sir, that your care did not extend to me only. The
      daughters of Marshal Simon were brought back by you; but we may imagine
      that the claim of the Duke de Ligny to the possession of his daughters
      would not have been in vain. You returned to an old soldier his imperial
      cross, which he held to be a sacred relic; it is a very touching incident.
      Finally, you unmasked the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Dr. Baleinier: but I
      had already made up my mind to unmask then. However, all this proves that
      you are a very clever man&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo; said Rodin, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of resources and invention&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my fault if, in our long interview at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s,
      you betrayed that superiority of mind which struck me so forcibly, and
      which seems to embarrass you so much at present. What would you have, sir?&mdash;great
      minds like yours find it difficult to maintain their incognito. Yet, as by
      different ways&mdash;oh! very different,&rdquo; added the young lady,
      maliciously, &ldquo;we are tending to the same end (still keeping in view
      our conversation at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s), I wish, for the sake of our
      future communion, as you call it, to give you a piece of advice, and speak
      frankly to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin had listened to Mdlle. de Cardoville with apparent impassibility,
      holding his hat under his arm, and twirling his thumbs, whilst his hands
      were crossed upon his waistcoat. The only external mark of the intense
      agitation into which he was thrown by the calm words of Adrienne, was that
      the livid eyelids of the Jesuit, which had been hypocritically closed,
      became gradually red, as the blood flowed into them. Nevertheless, he
      answered Mdlle. de Cardoville in a firm voice, and with a low bow: &ldquo;Good
      advice and frankness are always excellent things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, with some excitement,
      &ldquo;happy love bestows such penetration, such energy, such courage, as
      enables one to laugh at perils, to detect stratagems, and to defy hatred.
      Believe me, the divine light which surrounds two loving hearts will be
      sufficient to disperse all darkness, and reveal every snare. You see, in
      India&mdash;excuse my weakness, but I like to talk of India,&rdquo; added
      the young girl, with a smile of indescribable grace and meaning&mdash;&ldquo;in
      India, when travellers sleep at night, they kindle great fires round their
      ajoupa (excuse this touch of local coloring), and far as extends the
      luminous circle, it puts to flight by its mere brilliancy, all the impure
      and venomous reptiles that shun the day and live only in darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meaning of this comparison has quite escaped me,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, continuing to twirl his thumbs, and half raising his eyelids, which
      were getting redder and redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak more plainly,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a smile.
      &ldquo;Suppose, sir, that the last is a service which you have rendered me
      and the prince&mdash;for you only proceed by way of services&mdash;that, I
      acknowledge, is novel and ingenious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, my dear child!&rdquo; said the count, joyfully. &ldquo;The
      execution will be complete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this is meant for an execution?&rdquo; said Rodin, still
      impassible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, with a smile; &ldquo;it is a
      simple conversation between a poor young girl and an old philosopher, the
      friend of humanity. Suppose, then, that these frequent services that you
      have rendered to me and mine have suddenly opened my eyes; or, rather,&rdquo;
      added the young girl, in a serious tone, &ldquo;suppose that heaven, who
      gives to the mother the instinct to defend her child, has given me, along
      with happiness, the instinct to preserve my happiness, and that a vague
      presentiment, by throwing light on a thousand circumstances until now
      obscure, has suddenly revealed to me that, instead of being the friend,
      you are perhaps, the most dangerous enemy of myself and family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we pass from the execution to suppositions,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      still immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from suppositions, sir, if you must have it, to certainty,&rdquo;
      resumed Adrienne, with dignified firmness; &ldquo;yes, now I believe that
      I was for awhile your dupe, and I tell you, without hate, without anger,
      but with regret&mdash;that it is painful to see a man of your sense and
      intelligence stoop to such machinations, and, after having recourse to so
      many diabolical manoeuvres, finish at last by being ridiculous; for,
      believe me, there is nothing more ridiculous for a man like you, than to
      be vanquished by a young girl, who has no weapon, no defence, no
      instructor, but her love. In a word, sir, I look upon you from to-day as
      an implacable and dangerous enemy; for I half perceive your aim, without
      guessing by what means you will seek to accomplish it, No doubt your
      future means will be worthy of the past. Well! in spite of all this, I do
      not fear you. From tomorrow, my family will be informed of everything, and
      an active, intelligent, resolute union will keep us all upon our guard,
      for it doubtless concerns this enormous inheritance, of which they wish to
      deprive us. Now, what connection can there be between the wrongs I
      reproach you with and the pecuniary end proposed? I do not at all know&mdash;but
      you have told me yourself that our enemies are so dangerously skillful,
      and their craft so far-reaching, that we must expect all, be prepared for
      all. I will remember the lesson. I have promised you frankness, sir, and
      now I suppose you have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be an imprudent frankness if I were your enemy,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, still impassible; &ldquo;but you also promised me some advice,
      my dear young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice will be short; do not attempt to continue the struggle,
      because, you see, there is something stronger than you and yours&mdash;it
      is a woman&rsquo;s resolve, defending her happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne pronounced these last words with so sovereign a confidence; her
      beautiful countenance shone, as is it were, with such intrepid joy, that
      Rodin, notwithstanding his phlegmatic audacity, was for a moment
      frightened. Yet he did not appear in the least disconcerted; and, after a
      moment&rsquo;s silence, he resumed, with an air of almost contemptuous
      compassion: &ldquo;My dear young lady, we may perhaps never meet again; it
      is probable. Only remember one thing, which I now repeat to you: I never
      justify myself. The future will provide for that. Notwithstanding which,
      my dear young lady, I am your humble servant;&rdquo; and he made her a low
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count, I beg to salute you most respectfully,&rdquo; he added,
      bowing still more humbly to M. de Montbron; and he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Rodin left the room than Adrienne ran to her desk, and writing
      a few hasty lines, sealed the note, and said to M. de Montbron: &ldquo;I
      shall not see the prince before to-morrow&mdash;as much from superstition
      of the heart as because it is necessary for my plans that this interview
      should be attended with some little solemnity. You shall know all; but I
      write to him on the instant, for, with an enemy like M. Rodin, one must be
      prepared for all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear child; quick! the letter.&rdquo; Adrienne
      gave it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell him enough,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to calm his grief; and
      not enough to deprive me of the delicious happiness of the surprise I
      reserve for to morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this has as much sense as heart in it: I will hasten to the
      prince&rsquo;s abode, to deliver your letter. I shall not see him, for I
      could not answer for myself. But come! our proposed drive, our evening&rsquo;s
      amusement, are still to hold good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I have more need than ever to divert my thoughts till to
      morrow. I feel, too, that the fresh air will do me good, for this
      interview with M. Rodin has warmed me a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old wretch! but we will talk further of him. I will hasten to
      the prince&rsquo;s and return with Madame de Morinval, to fetch you to the
      Champs Elysees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count de Montbron withdrew precipitately, as joyful at his departure
      as he had been sad on his arrival.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was about two
      hours after the interview of Rodin with Mdlle. de Cardoville. Numerous
      loungers, attracted to the Champs-Elysees by the serenity of a fine spring
      day (it was towards the end of the month of March) stopped to admire a
      very handsome equipage. A bright-blue open carriage, with white-and-blue
      wheels, drawn by four superb horses, of cream color, with black manes, and
      harness glittering with silver ornaments, mounted by two boy postilions of
      equal size, with black velvet caps, light-blue cassimere jackets with
      white collars, buckskin breeches, and top-boots; two tall, powdered
      footmen, also in light-blue livery, with white collars and facings, being
      seated in the rumble behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      No equipage could have been turned out in better style. The horses, full
      of blood, spirit, and vigor, were skillfully managed by the postilions,
      and stepped with singular regularity, gracefully keeping time in their
      movements, champing their bits covered with foam, and ever and anon
      shaking their cockades of blue and white silk, with long floating ends,
      and a bright rose blooming in the midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man on horseback, dressed with elegant simplicity, keeping at the other
      side of the avenue, contemplated with proud satisfaction this equipage
      which he had, as it were, created. It was M. de Bonneville&mdash;Adrienne&rsquo;s
      equerry, as M. de Montbron called him&mdash;for the carriage belonged to
      that young lady. A change had taken place in the plan for this magic day&rsquo;s
      amusement. M. de Montbron had not been able to deliver Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&rsquo;s note to Prince Djalma. Faringhea had told him that the
      prince had gone that morning into the country with Marshal Simon, and
      would not be back before evening. The letter should be given him on his
      arrival. Completely satisfied as to Djalma, knowing that he could find
      these few lines, which, without informing him of the happiness that
      awaited him, would at least give him some idea of it, Adrienne had
      followed the advice of M. de Montbron, and gone to the drive in her own
      carriage, to show all the world that she had quite made up her mind, in
      spite of the perfidious reports circulated by the Princess de Saint
      Dizier, to keep to her resolution of living by herself in her own way.
      Adrienne wore a small white bonnet, with a fall of blonde, which well
      became her rosy face and golden hair; her high dress of garnet-colored
      velvet was almost hidden beneath a large green cashmere shawl. The young
      Marchioness de Morinval, who was also very pretty and elegant, was seated
      at her right. M. de Montbron occupied the front seat of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who know the Parisian world, or rather, that imperceptible fraction
      of the world of Paris which goes every fine, sunny day to the Champs
      Elysees, to see and be seen, will understand that the presence of Mdlle.
      de Cardoville on that brilliant promenade was an extraordinary and
      interesting event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world (as it is called) could hardly believe its eyes, on seeing this
      lady of eighteen, possessed of princely wealth, and belonging to the
      highest nobility, thus prove to every one, by this appearance in public,
      that she was living completely free and independent, contrary to all
      custom and received notions of propriety. This kind of emancipation
      appeared something monstrous, and people were almost astonished that the
      graceful and dignified bearing of the young lady should belie so
      completely the calumnies circulated by Madame de Saint-Dizier and her
      friends, with regard to the pretended madness of her niece. Many beaux,
      profiting by their acquaintance with the Marchioness de Morinval or M. de
      Montbron, came by turns to pay their respects, and rode for a few minutes
      by the side of the carriage, so as to have an opportunity of seeing,
      admiring, and perhaps hearing, Mdlle. de Cardoville; she surpassed their
      expectations, by talking with her usual grace and spirit. Then surprise
      and enthusiasm knew no bounds. What had at first been blamed as an almost
      insane caprice, was now voted a charming originality, and it only depended
      on Mdlle. de Cardoville herself, to be declared from that day the queen of
      elegance and fashion. The young lady understood very well the impression
      she had made; she felt proud and happy, for she thought of Djalma; when
      she compared him to all these men of fashion, her happiness was the more
      increased. And, verily, these young men, most of whom had never quitted
      Paris, or had ventured at most as far as Naples or Baden, looked
      insignificant enough by the side of Djalma, who, at his age, had so many
      times commanded and combated in bloody wars, and whose reputation far
      courage and generosity, mentioned by travellers with admiration, had
      already reached from India to Paris. And then, how could these charming
      exquisites, with their small hats, their scanty frock-coats, and their
      huge cravats, compare with the Indian prince, whose graceful and manly
      beauty was still heightened by the splendor of a costume, at once so rich
      and so picturesque?

      <a href="images/20567.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      On this happy day, all was joy and love for Adrienne. The sun, setting in
      a splendidly serene sky, flooded the promenade with its golden light. The
      air was warm. Carriages and horsemen passed and repassed in rapid
      succession; a light breeze played with the scarfs of the women, and the
      plumes in their bonnets; all around was noise, movement, sunshine.
      Adrienne, leaning back in her carriage, amused herself with watching this
      busy scene, sparkling with Parisian luxury; but, in the vortex of this
      brilliant chaos, she saw in thought the mild, melancholy countenance of
      Djalma&mdash;when suddenly something fell into her lap, and she started.
      It was a bunch of half-faded violets. At the same instant she heard a
      child&rsquo;s voice following the carriage, and saying: &ldquo;For the
      love of heaven, my good lady, one little sou!&rdquo; Adrienne turned her
      head, and saw a poor little girl, pale and wan, with mild, sorrowful
      features, scarcely covered with rags, holding out her hand, and raising
      her eyes in supplication. Though the striking contrast of extreme misery,
      side by side with extreme luxury, is so common, that it no longer excites
      attention, Adrienne was deeply affected by it. She thought of Mother
      Bunch, now, perhaps, the victim of frightful destitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! at least,&rdquo; thought the young lady, &ldquo;let not this
      day be one of happiness for me alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned from the carriage-window, and said to the poor child: &ldquo;Have
      you a mother, my dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lady, I have neither father nor mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who takes care of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, my lady. They give me nosegays to sell, and I must bring
      home money&mdash;or they beat me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sou, my good lady&mdash;a sou, for the love of heaven!&rdquo;
      said the child, continuing to follow the carriage, which was then moving
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; said Adrienne, smiling, and addressing M. de
      Montbron, &ldquo;you are, unfortunately, no novice at an elopement. Please
      to stretch forth your arms, take up that child with both hands, and lift
      her into the carriage. We can hide her between Lady de Morinval and
      myself; and we can drive away before any one perceives this audacious
      abduction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the count, in surprise. &ldquo;You wish&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I beg you to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a folly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, you might, perhaps, have treated this caprice as a
      folly; but to-day,&rdquo; said Adrienne, laying great stress upon the
      word, and glancing at M. de Montbron with a significant air, &ldquo;to-day,
      you should understand that it is almost a duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand you, good and noble heart!&rdquo; said the count,
      with emotion; while Lady de Morinval, who knew nothing of Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&rsquo;s love for Djalma, looked with as much surprise as
      curiosity at the count and the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Montbron, leaning from the carriage, stretched out his arms towards
      the child, and said to her: &ldquo;Give me your hands, little girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though much astonished, the child obeyed mechanically, and held out both
      her little arms; then the count took her by the wrists, and lifted her
      lightly from the ground, which he did the more easily, as the carnage was
      very low, and its progress by no means rapid. More stupefied than
      frightened, the child said not a word. Adrienne and Lady de Morinval made
      room for her to crouch down between them, and the little girl was soon
      hidden beneath the shawls of the two young women. All this was executed so
      quickly, that it was hardly perceived by a few persons passing in the
      side-avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear count,&rdquo; said Adrienne, radiant with pleasure,
      &ldquo;let us make off at once with our prey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Montbron half rose, and called to the postilions. &ldquo;Home!&rdquo;
      and the four horses started at once into a rapid and regular trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day of happiness now seems consecrated, and my luxury is
      excused,&rdquo; thought Adrienne; &ldquo;till I can again meet with that
      poor Mother Bunch, and from this day I will make every exertion to find
      her out, her place will at least not be quite empty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are often strange coincidences in life. At the moment when this
      thought of the hunchback crossed the mind of Adrienne, a crowd had
      collected in one of the side-avenues, and other persons soon ran to join
      the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, uncle!&rdquo; said Lady de Morinval; &ldquo;how many people
      are assembled yonder. What can it be? Shall we stop, and send to inquire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, my dear, but your curiosity cannot be satisfied,&rdquo;
      said the count, drawing out his watch; &ldquo;it will soon be six o&rsquo;clock,
      and the exhibition of the wild beasts begin at eight. We shall only just
      have time to go home and dine. Is not that your opinion, my dear child?&rdquo;
      said he to Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours, Julia?&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville to the
      marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; answered her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the less inclined to delay,&rdquo; resumed the count, &ldquo;as
      when I have taken you to the Porte-Saint-Martin, I shall be obliged to go
      for half an-hour to my club, to ballot for Lord Campbell, whom I propose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Adrienne and I will be left alone at the play, uncle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband will go with you, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, dear uncle; but do not quite leave us, because of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure I shall not: for I am curious as you are to see these
      terrible animals, and the famous Morok, the incomparable lion-tamer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes after, Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s carriage had left the
      Champs Elysees, carrying with it the little girl, and directing its course
      towards the Rue d&rsquo;Anjou. As the brilliant equipage disappeared from
      the scene, the crowd, of which we before have spoken, greatly increased
      about one of the large trees in the Champs-Elysees, and expressions of
      pity were heard here and there amongst the groups. A lounger approached a
      young man on the skirts of the crowd, and said to him: &ldquo;What is the
      matter, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear it is a poor young girl, a hunchback, that has fallen from
      exhaustion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hunchback! is that all? There will always be enough hunchbacks,&rdquo;
      said the lounger, brutally, with a coarse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunchback or not, if she dies of hunger,&rdquo; answered the young
      man, scarcely able to restrain his indignation, &ldquo;it will be no less
      sad&mdash;and there is really nothing to laugh at, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die of hunger! pooh!&rdquo; said the lounger, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;It is only lazy scoundrels, that will not work, who die
      of hunger. And it serves them right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wager, sir, there is one death you will never die of,&rdquo;
      cried the young man, incensed at the cruel insolence of the lounger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; answered the other, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, sir, that your heart is not likely to kill you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried the lounger in an angry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what, sir?&rdquo; replied the young man, looking full in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the lounger, turning abruptly on his heel, and
      grumbling as he sauntered towards an orange-colored cabriolet, on which
      was emblazoned an enormous coat-of-arms, surmounted by a baron&rsquo;s
      crest. A servant in green livery, ridiculously laced with gold, was
      standing beside the horse, and did not perceive his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you catching flies, fool?&rdquo; said the latter, pushing him
      with his cane. The servant turned round in confusion. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you never learn to call me Monsieur le Baron, rascal?&rdquo;
      cried his master, in a rage&mdash;&ldquo;Open the door directly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lounger was Baron Tripeaud, the manufacturing baron the stock-jobber.
      The poor hunchback was Mother Bunch, who had, indeed fallen with hunger
      and fatigue, whilst on her way to Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s. The
      unfortunate creature had found courage to brave the shame of the ridicule
      she so much feared, by returning to that house from which she was a
      voluntary exile; but this time, it was not for herself, but for her sister
      Cephyse&mdash;the Bacchanal Queen, who had returned to Paris the previous
      day, and whom Mother Bunch now sought, through the means of Adrienne, to
      rescue from a most dreadful fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours after these different scenes, an enormous crowd pressed round
      the doors of the Porte-Saint-Martin, to witness the exercises of Morok,
      who was about to perform a mock combat with the famous black panther of
      Java, named Death. Adrienne, accompanied by Lord and Lady de Morinval, now
      stepped from a carriage at the entrance of the theatre. They were to be
      joined in the course of the evening by M. de Montbron, whom they had
      dropped, in passing, at his club.

      <a href="images/20575.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The large theatre of the Porte-Saint-Martin was crowded by an impatient
      multitude. All Paris had hurried with eager and burning curiosity to Morok&rsquo;s
      exhibition. It is quite unnecessary to say that the lion-tamer had
      completely abandoned his small taste in religious baubles, which he had so
      successfully carried on at the White Falcon Inn at Leipsic. There were,
      moreover, numerous tokens by which the surprising effects of Morok&rsquo;s
      sudden conversion had been blazoned in the most extraordinary pictures:
      the antiquated baubles in which he had formerly dealt would have found no
      sale in Paris. Morok had nearly finished dressing himself, in one of the
      actor&rsquo;s rooms, which had been lent to him. Over a coat of mail, with
      cuishes and brassarts, he wore an ample pair of red trousers, fastened
      round his ankles by broad rings of gilt brass. His long caftan of black
      cloth, embroidered with scarlet and gold, was bound round his waist and
      wrist by other large rings of gilt metal. This sombre costume imparted to
      him an aspect still more ferocious. His thick and red-haired beard fell in
      large quantities down to his chest, and a long piece of white muslin was
      folded round his red head. A devout missionary in Germany and an actor in
      Paris, Morok knew as well as his employers, the Jesuits, how to
      accommodate himself to circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in one corner of the room, and contemplating with a sort of stupid
      admiration, was Jacques Rennepont, better known as &ldquo;Sleepinbuff&rdquo;
      (from the likelihood that he would end his days in rags, or his present
      antipathy to great care in dress). Since the day Hardy&rsquo;s factory had
      been destroyed by fire, Jacques had not quitted Morok, passing the nights
      in excesses, which had no baneful effects on the iron constitution of the
      lion-tamer. On the other&rsquo;s features, on the contrary, a great
      alteration was perceptible; his hollow cheeks, marble pallor, his eyes, by
      turns dull and heavy, or gleaming with lurid fire, betrayed the ravages of
      debauchery, his parched lips were almost constantly curled by a bitter and
      sardonic smile. His spirit, once gay and sanguine, still struggled against
      the besotting influence of habitual intoxication. Unfitted for labor, no
      longer able to forego gross pleasures, Jacques sought to drown in wine a
      few virtuous impulses which he still possessed, and had sunk so low as to
      accept without shame the large dole of sensual gratification proffered him
      by Morok, who paid all the expenses of their orgies, but never gave him
      money, in order that he might be completely dependent on him. After gazing
      at Morok for some time in amazement, Jacques said to him, in a familiar
      tone: &ldquo;Well, yours is a famous trade; you may boast that, at this
      moment, there are not two men like you in the whole world That&rsquo;s
      flattering. It&rsquo;s a pity you don&rsquo;t stick to this fine trade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how is the conspiracy going on, in whose honor you make me
      keep it up all day and all night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is working, but the time is not yet come; that is why I wish to
      have you always at hand, till the great day. Do you complain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, no!&rdquo; said Jacques. &ldquo;What could I do? Burnt up
      with brandy as I am, if I wanted to work, I&rsquo;ve no longer the
      strength to do so. I have not, like you, a head of marble, and a body of
      iron; but as for fuddling myself with gunpowder, instead of anything else,
      that&rsquo;ll do for me; I&rsquo;m only fit for that work now&mdash;and
      then, it will drive away thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh what kind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that when I do think, I think only of one thing,&rdquo;
      said Jacques, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bacchanal queen?&mdash;still?&rdquo; said Morok, in a
      disdainful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still! rather: when I shall think of her no longer, I shall be dead&mdash;or
      stupefied. Fiend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were never better or more intelligent, you fool!&rdquo; replied
      Morok, fastening his turban. The conversation was here interrupted. Morok&rsquo;s
      aider entered hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gigantic form of this Hercules had increased in width. He was habited
      like Alcides; his enormous limbs, furrowed with veins as thick as
      whipcord, were covered with a close-fitting flesh-colored garment, to
      which a pair of red drawers formed a strong contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you rush in like a storm, Goliath?&rdquo; said Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pretty storm in the house; they are beginning to
      get impatient, and are calling out like madmen. But if that were all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death will not be able to play this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok turned quickly around. He seemed uneasy. &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just seen her! she&rsquo;s crouching at the bottom of her
      cage; her ears lie so close to her head, she looks as if they had been cut
      off. You know what that means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Morok, turning to the glass to complete
      his head dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite enough; she&rsquo;s in one of her tearing fits.
      Since that night in Germany, when she ripped up that old hack of a white
      horse, I&rsquo;ve not seen her look so savage! her eyes shine like burning
      candles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she must have her fine collar on,&rdquo; said Morok, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her fine collar?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; her spring-collar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I must be lady&rsquo;s-maid,&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;A
      nice toilet to attend to!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all&mdash;&rdquo; continued Goliath, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might as well tell you at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! he is here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, you stupid brute?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Englishman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok started; his arms fell powerless by his side. Jacques was struck
      with the lion-tamer&rsquo;s paleness and troubled countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Englishman!&mdash;you have seen him?&rdquo; cried Morok,
      addressing Goliath. &ldquo;You are quite sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. I was looking through the peep-hole in the curtain; I
      saw him in one of the stage-boxes&mdash;he wishes to see things close; he&rsquo;s
      easy to recognize, with his pointed forehead, big nose, and goggle eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok shuddered again; usually fierce and unmoved, he appeared to be more
      and more agitated, and so alarmed, that Jacques said to him: &ldquo;Who is
      this Englishman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has followed me from Strasburg, where he fell in with me,&rdquo;
      said Morok, with visible dejection. &ldquo;He travelled with his own
      horses, by short stages, as I did; stopping where I stopped, so as never
      to miss one of my exhibitions. But two days before I arrived at Paris, he
      left me&mdash;I thought I was rid of him,&rdquo; said Morok, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rid of him!&mdash;how you talk!&rdquo; replied Jacques, surprised;
      &ldquo;such a good customer, such an admirer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; said Morok, becoming more and more agitated; &ldquo;this
      wretch has wagered an enormous sum, that I will be devoured in his
      presence, during one of my performances: he hopes to win his wager&mdash;that
      is why he follows me about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleepinbuff found the John Bull&rsquo;s idea so amusingly eccentric, that,
      for the first time since a very long period, he burst into a peal of
      hearty laughter. Morok, pale with rage, rushed towards him with so
      menacing an air, that Goliath was obliged to interpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Jacques, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be angry; if it
      is serious, I will not laugh any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok was appeased, and said to Sleepinbuff in a hoarse voice: &ldquo;Do
      you think me a coward?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! And yet this Englishman, with his grotesque face, frightens
      me more than any tiger or my panther!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say so, and I believe it,&rdquo; replied Jacques; &ldquo;but I
      cannot understand why the presence of this man should alarm you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But consider, you dull knave!&rdquo; cried Morok, &ldquo;that,
      obliged to watch incessantly the least movement of the ferocious beast,
      whom I keep in subjection by my action and my looks, there is something
      terrible in knowing that two eyes are there&mdash;always there&mdash;fixed&mdash;waiting
      till the least absence of mind shall expose me to be torn in pieces by the
      animals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I understand,&rdquo; said Jacques, shuddering in his turn.
      &ldquo;It is terrible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for once there, though I may not see this cursed Englishman, I
      fancy I have his two round eyes, fixed and wide open, always before me. My
      tiger Cain once nearly mutilated my arm, when my attention was drawn away
      by this Englishman, whom the devil take! Blood and thunder!&rdquo; cried
      Morok: &ldquo;this man will be fatal to me.&rdquo; And Morok paced the
      room in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Death lays her ears close to her skull,&rdquo; said
      Goliath, brutally. &ldquo;If you persist&mdash;mind, I tell you&mdash;the
      Englishman will win his wager this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, you brute!&mdash;don&rsquo;t vex my head with your
      confounded predictions,&rdquo; cried Morok: &ldquo;go and prepare Death&rsquo;s
      collar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, every one to his taste; you wish the panther to taste you,&rdquo;
      said the giant, stalking heavily away, after this joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you feel these fears,&rdquo; said Jacques, &ldquo;why do you
      not say that the panther is ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok shrugged his shoulders, and replied with a sort of feverish
      ferocity, &ldquo;Have you ever heard of the fierce pleasure of the
      gamester, who stakes his honor, his life, upon a card? Well! I too&mdash;in
      these daily exhibitions where my life is at stake&mdash;find a wild,
      fierce pleasure in braving death, before a crowded assembly, shuddering
      and terrified at my audacity. Yes, even in the fear with which this
      Englishman inspires me, I find, in spite of myself, a terrible excitement,
      which I abhor, and which yet subjugates me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the stage-manager entered the room, and interrupted the
      beast-tamer. &ldquo;May we give the signal, M. Morok?&rdquo; said the
      stage-manager. &ldquo;The overture will not last above ten minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police-inspector has just now given orders, that the double
      chain of the panther, and the iron ring riveted to the floor of the stage,
      at the end of the cavern in the foreground, shall be again examined; and
      everything has been reported quite secure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;secure&mdash;except for me,&rdquo; murmured the
      beast-tamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, M. Morok, the signal may be given?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signal may&mdash;be given,&rdquo; replied Morok. And the
      manager went out.

      CHAPTER XIII. UP WITH THE CURTAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he usual bell
      sounded with solemnity behind the scenes the overture began, and, to say
      the truth, but little attention was paid to it. The interior of the
      theatre offered a very animated view. With the exception of two
      stage-boxes even with the dress circle, one to the left, the other to the
      right of the audience, every seat was occupied. A great number of very
      fashionable ladies, attracted, as is always the case, by the strange
      wildness of the spectacle, filled the boxes. The stalls were crowded by
      most of the young men who; in the morning, had walked their horses on the
      Champs-Elysees. The observations which passed from one stall to another,
      will give some idea of their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear boy, there would not be so crowded or
      fashionable an audience to witness Racine&rsquo;s Athalia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. What is the beggarly howling of an actor, compared to
      the roaring of the lion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand how the authorities permit this Morok to fasten
      his panther with a chain to an iron ring in the corner of the stage. If
      the chain were to break?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of broken chains&mdash;there&rsquo;s little Mme. de
      Blinville, who is no tigress. Do you see her in the second tier, opposite?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It becomes her very well to have broken, as you say, the marriage
      chain; she looks very well this season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there is the beautiful Duchess de Saint-Prix; all the world is
      here to-night&mdash;I don&rsquo;t speak of ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a regular opera night&mdash;what a festive scene!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after all, people do well to amuse themselves, perhaps it
      will not be for long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose the cholera were to come to Paris?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nonsense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in the cholera?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do! He&rsquo;s coming from the North, with his
      walking-stick under his arm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take him on the road! don&rsquo;t let us see his green
      visage here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s at London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasant journey to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us talk of something else; it may be a weakness, if you
      please, but I call this a dull subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! gentlemen&mdash;I am not mistaken&mdash;no&mdash;it is she!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mdlle. de Cardoville! She is coming into the stage-box with
      Morinval and his wife. It is a complete resuscitation: this morning on the
      Champs-Elysees; in the evening here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, you are right! It is Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven! how lovely she is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me your eyeglass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exquisite&mdash;dazzling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in addition to her beauty, an inexhaustible flow of wit, three
      hundred thousand francs a year, high birth, eighteen years of age, and&mdash;free
      as air.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Yes, that is to say, that, provided it pleased her, I might be to

    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough to turn one&rsquo;s brain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told that her mansion, Rue d&rsquo;Anjou, is like an enchanted
      palace; a great deal is said about a bath-room and bedroom, worthy of the
      Arabian Nights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And free as air&mdash;I come back to that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! if I were in her place!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My levity would be quite shocking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! gentlemen, what a happy man will he be who is loved first!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that she will have many lovers?&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;All the boxes are full, except the stage-box opposite to that in
      which Mdlle. de Cardoville is seated. Happy the occupiers of that box!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the English ambassador&rsquo;s lady in the dress
      circle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Princess d&rsquo;Alvimar&mdash;what an enormous bouquet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know the name&mdash;of that nosegay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;it&rsquo;s Germigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How flattering for the lions and tigers, to attract so fashionable
      an audience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you notice, gentlemen, how all the women are eye-glassing Mdlle.
      de Cardoville?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She makes a sensation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is right to show herself; they gave her out as mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! gentlemen, what a capital phiz!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;in the omnibus-box beneath Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Nuremburg nutcracker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ourang-outang!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such round, staring eyes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the nose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the forehead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a caricature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, order! the curtain rises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, the curtain rose. Some explanation is necessary for the
      clear understanding of what follows. In the lower stage-box, to the left
      of the audience, were several persons, who had been referred to by the
      young men in the stalls. The omnibus-box was occupied by the Englishman,
      the eccentric and portentous bettor, whose presence inspired Morok with so
      much dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would require Hoffman&rsquo;s rare and fantastic genius to describe
      worthily that countenance, at once grotesque and frightful, as it stood
      out from the dark background of the box. This Englishman was about fifty
      years old; his forehead was quite bald, and of a conical shape; beneath
      this forehead, surmounted by eyebrows like parenthesis marks, glittered
      large, green eyes, remarkably round and staring, and set very close to a
      hooked nose, extremely sharp and prominent; a chin like that on the old
      fashioned nutcrackers was half-hidden in a broad and ample white cravat,
      as stiffly-starched as the round-cornered shirt-collar, which nearly
      touched his ears. The face was exceedingly thin and bony, and yet the
      complexion was high-colored, approaching to purple, which made the bright
      green of the pupils, and the white of the other part of the eyes, still
      more conspicuous. The mouth, which was very wide, sometimes whistled
      inaudibly the tune of a Scotch jig (always the same tune), sometimes was
      slightly curled with a sardonic smite. The Englishman was dressed with
      extreme care; his blue coat, with brass buttons, displayed his spotless
      waistcoat, snowy, white as his ample cravat; his shirt was fastened with
      two magnificent ruby studs, and his patrician hands were carefully kid
      gloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      To any one who knew the eccentric and cruel desire which attracted this
      man to every representation, his grotesque face became almost terrific,
      instead of exciting ridicule; and it was easy to understand the dread
      experience by Morok at sight of those great, staring round eyes, which
      appeared to watch for the death of the lion-tamer (what a horrible death!)
      with unshaken confidence. Above the dark box of the Englishman, affording
      a graceful contrast, were seated the Morinvals and Mdlle. de Cardoville.
      The latter was placed nearest the stage. Her head was uncovered, and she
      wore a dress of sky-blue China crepe, ornamented at the bosom with a
      brooch of the finest Oriental pearls&mdash;nothing more; yet Adrienne,
      thus attired, was charming. She held in her hand an enormous bouquet,
      composed of the rarest flowers of India: the stephanotis and the gardenia
      mingled the dead white of their blossoms with the purple hibiscus and Java
      amaryllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Morinval, seated on the opposite side of the box, was dressed
      with equal taste and simplicity; Morinval, a fair and very handsome young
      man, of elegant appearance, was behind the two ladies. M. de Montbron was
      expected to arrive every moment. The reader will please to recollect that
      the stage-box to the right of the audience, opposite Adrienne&rsquo;s, had
      remained till then quite empty. The stage represented one of the gigantic
      forests of India. In the background, tall exotic trees rose in spiral or
      spreading forms, among rugged masses of perpendicular rocks, with here and
      there glimpses of a tropical sky. The side-scenes formed tufts of trees,
      interspersed with rocks; and at the side which was immediately beneath
      Adrienne&rsquo;s box appeared the irregular opening of a deep and gloomy
      cavern, round which were heaped huge blocks of granite, as if thrown
      together by some convulsion of nature. This scenery, full of a wild and
      savage grandeur, was wonderfully &ldquo;built up,&rdquo; so as to make the
      illusion as complete as possible; the footlights were lowered, and being
      covered with a purple shade, threw over this landscape a subdued reddish
      light, which increased the gloomy and startling effect of the whole.
      Adrienne, leaning forward from the box, with cheeks slightly flushed,
      sparkling eyes, and throbbing heart, sought to trace in this scene the
      solitary forest described by the traveller who had eulogized Djalma&rsquo;s
      generosity and courage, when he threw himself upon a ferocious tigress to
      save the life of a poor black slave. Chance coincided wonderfully indeed
      with her recollections. Absorbed in the contemplation of the scenery and
      the thoughts it awakened in her heart, she paid no attention to what was
      passing in the house. And yet something calculated to excite curiosity was
      taking place in the opposite stage-box.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20583.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The door of this box opened. A man about forty years of age, of a yellow
      complexion, entered; he was clothed after the East Indian fashion, in a
      long robe of orange silk, bound round the waist with a green sash, and he
      wore a small white turban. He placed two chairs at the front of the box;
      and, having glanced round the house for a moment, he started, his black
      eyes sparkled, and he went out quickly. That man was Faringhea. His
      apparition caused surprise and curiosity in the theatre; the majority of
      the spectators not having, like Adrienne, a thousand reasons for being
      absorbed in the contemplation of a picturesque set scene. The public
      attention was still more excited when they saw the box which Faringhea had
      just left, entered by a youth of rare beauty, also dressed Oriental
      fashion, in a long robe of white Cashmere with flowing sleeves, with a
      scarlet turban striped with gold on his head, and a sash to correspond, in
      which was stuck a long dagger, glittering with precious stones. This young
      man was Prince Djalma. For an instant he remained standing at the door,
      and cast a look of indifference upon the immense theatre, crowded with
      people; then, stepping forward with a majestic and tranquil air, the
      prince seated himself negligently on one of the chairs, and, turning his
      head in a few moments towards the entrance, appeared surprised at not
      seeing some person whom he doubtless expected. This person appeared at
      length; the boxkeeper had been assisting her to take off her cloak. She
      was a charming, fair-haired girl, attired with more show than taste, in a
      dress of white silk, with broad cherry-colored stripes, made ultra
      fashionably low, and with short sleeves; a large bow of cherry-colored
      ribbon was placed on each side of her light hair, and set off the
      prettiest, sprightliest, most wilful little face in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Rose-Pompon. Her pretty arms were partly covered by long white
      gloves, and ridiculously loaded with bracelets: in her hand she carried an
      enormous bouquet of roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from imitating the calm demeanor of Djalma, Rose-Pompon skipped into
      the box, moved the chairs about noisily, and fidgeted on her seat for some
      time, to display her fine dress; then, without being in the least
      intimidated by the presence of the brilliant assembly, she, with a little
      coquettish air, held her bouquet towards Djalma, that he might smell it,
      and appeared finally to establish herself on her seat. Faringhea came in,
      shut the door of the box, and seated himself behind the prince. Adrienne,
      still completely absorbed in the contemplation of the Indian forest, and
      in her own sweet thoughts, had not observed the newcomers. As she was
      turning her head completely towards the stage, and Djalma could not, for
      the moment, see even her profile, he, on his side, had not recognized
      Mdlle. de Cardoville.

      CHAPTER XIV. DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he pantomime
      opening, by which was introduced the combat of Morok with the black
      panther, was so unmeaning, that the majority of the audience paid no
      attention to it, reserving all their interest for the scene in which the
      lion-tamer was to make his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This indifference of the public explains the curiosity excited in the
      theatre by the arrival of Faringhea and Djalma&mdash;a curiosity which
      expressed itself (as at this day, when uncommon foreigners appear in
      public) by a slight murmur and general movement amongst the crowd. The
      sprightly, pretty face of Rose-Pompon, always charming, in spite of her
      singularly staring dress, in style so ridiculous for such a theatre, and
      her light and familiar manner towards the handsome Indian who accompanied
      her, increased and animated the general surprise; for, at this moment,
      Rose-Pompon, yielding without reserve to a movement of teasing coquetry,
      had held up, as we have already stated, her large bunch of roses to
      Djalma. But the prince, at sight of the landscape which reminded him of
      his country, instead of appearing sensible to this pretty, provocation,
      remained for some minutes as in a dream, with his eyes fixed upon the
      stage. Then Rose-Pompon began to beat time on the front of the box with
      her bouquet, whilst the somewhat too visible movement of her pretty
      shoulders showed that this devoted dancer was thinking of fast-life
      dances, as the orchestra struck up a more lively strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed directly opposite the box in which Faringhea, Djalma, and Rose
      Pompon had just taken their seats, Lady Morinval soon perceived the
      arrival of these two personages, and particularly the eccentric coquetries
      of Rose-Pompon. Immediately, the young marchioness, leaning over towards
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, who was still absorbed in memories ineffable, said
      to her, laughing: &ldquo;My dear, the most amusing part of the performance
      is not upon the stage. Look just opposite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just opposite?&rdquo; repeated Adrienne, mechanically: and, turning
      towards Lady Morinval with an air of surprise, she glanced in the
      direction pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked&mdash;what did she see?&mdash;Djalma seated by the side of a
      young woman, who was familiarly offering to his sense of smell the perfume
      of her bouquet. Amazed, struck almost literally to the heart, as by an
      electric shock, swift, sharp, and painful, Adrienne became deadly pale.
      From instinct, she shut her eyes for a second, in order not to see&mdash;as
      men try to ward off the dagger, which, having once dealt the blow,
      threatens to strike again. Then suddenly, to this feeling of grief
      succeeded a reflection, terrible both to her love and to her wounded
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma is present with this woman, though he must have received my
      letter,&rdquo; she said to herself,&mdash;&ldquo;wherein he was informed
      of the happiness that awaited him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the idea of so cruel an insult, a blush of shame and indignation
      displaced Adrienne&rsquo;s paleness, who overwhelmed by this sad reality,
      said to herself: &ldquo;Rodin did not deceive me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We abandon all idea of picturing the lightning-like rapidity of certain
      emotions which in a moment may torture&mdash;may kill you in the space of
      a minute. Thus Adrienne was precipitated from the most radiant happiness
      to the lowest depths of an abyss of the most heart-rending grief, in less
      than a second; for a second had hardly elapsed before she replied to Lady
      Morinval: &ldquo;What is there, then, so curious, opposite to us, my dear
      Julia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This evasive question gave Adrienne time to recover her self-possession.
      Fortunately, thanks to the thick folds of hair which almost entirely
      concealed her cheeks, the rapid and sudden changes from pallor to blush
      escaped the notice of Lady Morinval, who gayly replied: &ldquo;What, my
      dear, do you not perceive those East Indians, who have just entered the
      box immediately opposite to ours? There, just before us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see them; but what then?&rdquo; replied Adrienne, in a firm
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you observe anything remarkable?&rdquo; said the
      marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard, ladies,&rdquo; laughingly interposed the
      marquis; &ldquo;we ought to allow the poor foreigners some little
      indulgence. They are ignorant of our manners and customs; were it not for
      that, they would never appear in the face of all Paris in such dubious
      company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a bitter smile, &ldquo;their
      simplicity is touching; we must pity them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, unfortunately, the girl is charming, spite of her low dress
      and bare arms,&rdquo; said the marchioness; &ldquo;she cannot be more than
      sixteen or seventeen at most. Look at her, my dear Adrienne; what a pity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of your charitable days, my dear Julia,&rdquo; answered
      Adrienne; &ldquo;we are to pity the Indians, to pity this creature, and&mdash;pray,
      whom else are we to pity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not pity that handsome Indian, in his red-and-gold turban,&rdquo;
      said the marquis, laughing, &ldquo;for, if this goes on, the girl with the
      cherry colored ribbons will be giving him a kiss. See how she leans
      towards her sultan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very amusing,&rdquo; said the marchioness, sharing the
      hilarity of her husband, and looking at Rose-Pompom through her glass;
      then she resumed, in about a minute, addressing herself to Adrienne:
      &ldquo;I am quite certain of one thing. Notwithstanding her giddy airs,
      that girl is very fond of her Indian. I just saw a look that expresses a
      great deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so much penetration, my dear Julia?&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      mildly; &ldquo;what interest have we to read the heart of that girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if she loves her sultan, she is quite in the right,&rdquo;
      said the marquis, looking through his opera-glass in turn; &ldquo;for, in
      my whole life, I never saw a more handsome fellow than that Indian. I can
      only catch his side-face, but the profile is pure and fine as an antique
      cameo. Do you not think so?&rdquo; added the marquis, leaning towards
      Adrienne. &ldquo;Of course, it is only as a matter of art, that I permit
      myself to ask you the question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a work of art,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, &ldquo;it is certainly
      very fine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But see!&rdquo; said the marchioness; &ldquo;how impertinent the
      little creature is!&mdash;She is actually staring at us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the marquis; &ldquo;and she is actually laying
      her hand quite unceremoniously on her sultan&rsquo;s shoulder, to make him
      share, no doubt, in her admiration of you ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Djalma, until now occupied with the contemplation of the scene
      which reminded him of his country, had remained insensible to the
      enticements of Rose-Pompon, and had not yet perceived Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, bustling herself about in front
      of the box, and continuing to stare at Mdlle. de Cardoville, for it was
      she, and not the marchioness, who now drew her attention; &ldquo;that is
      something quite out of the common way&mdash;a pretty woman, with red hair;
      but such sweet red, it must be owned. Look, Prince Charming!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, she tapped Djalma lightly on the shoulder; he started at
      these words, turned round, and for the first time perceived Mdlle. de
      Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he had been almost prepared for this meeting, the prince was so
      violently affected by it, that he was about involuntarily to rise, in a
      state of the utmost confusion; but he felt the iron hand of Faringhea laid
      heavily on his shoulder, and heard him whisper in Hindostanee: &ldquo;Courage!
      and by to-morrow she will be at your feet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Djalma still struggled to rise, the half-caste added to restrain him:
      &ldquo;Just now, she grew pale and red with jealousy. No weakness, or all
      is lost!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! there you are again, talking your dreadful gibberish,&rdquo;
      said Rose Pompon, turning round towards Faringhea. &ldquo;First of all, it
      is not polite; and then the language is so odd, that one might suppose you
      were cracking nuts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke of you to my master,&rdquo; said the half-caste; &ldquo;he
      is preparing a surprise for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surprise? oh! that is different. Only make haste&mdash;do you
      hear, Prince Charming!&rdquo; added she, looking tenderly at Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart is breaking,&rdquo; said Djalma, in a hollow voice to
      Faringhea, still using the language of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to-morrow it will bound with joy and love,&rdquo; answered the
      half-caste. &ldquo;It is only by disdain that you can conquer a proud
      woman. To-morrow, I tell you, she will be trembling, confused,
      supplicating, at your feet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, she will hate me like death!&rdquo; replied the prince,
      mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, were she now to see you weak and cowardly. It is now too late
      to draw back; look full at her, take the nosegay from this girl, and raise
      it to your lips. Instantly, you will see yonder woman, proud as she is,
      grow pale and red, as just now. Then will you believe me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduced by despair to make almost any attempt, and fascinated, in spite of
      himself, by the diabolical hints of Faringhea, Djalma looked for a second
      full at Mdlle. de Cardoville; then, with a trembling hand he took the
      bouquet from Rose-Pompon, and, again looking at Adrienne, pressed it to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this insolent bravado, Mdlle. de Cardoville could not restrain so
      sudden and visible a pang, that the prince was struck by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is yours,&rdquo; said the half-caste, to him. &ldquo;Did you
      see, my lord, how she trembled with jealousy?&mdash;Only have courage! and
      she is yours. She will soon prefer you to that handsome young man behind
      her&mdash;for it is he whom she has hitherto fancied herself in love with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As if the half-caste had guessed the movement of rage and hatred, which
      this revelation would excite in the heart of the prince, he hastily added:
      &ldquo;Calmness and disdain! Is it not his turn now to hate you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince restrained himself, and drew his hand across his forehead which
      glowed with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now! what are you telling him, that vexes him so?&rdquo; said
      Rose Pompon to Faringhea, with pouting lip. Then, addressing Djalma, she
      continued: &ldquo;Come, Prince Charming, as they say in the fairy-tale,
      give me back my flowers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she took it again, she added: &ldquo;You have kissed it, and I could
      almost eat it.&rdquo; Then, with a sigh, and a passionate glance at
      Djalma, she said softly to herself: &ldquo;That monster Ninny Moulin did
      not deceive me. All this is quite proper; I have not even that to reproach
      myself with.&rdquo; And with her little white teeth, she bit at a rosy
      nail of her right hand, from which she had just drawn the glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly necessary to say, that Adrienne&rsquo;s letter had not been
      delivered to the prince, and that he had not gone to pass the day in the
      country with Marshal Simon. During the three days in which Montbron had
      not seen Djalma, Faringhea had persuaded him, that, by affecting another
      passion, he would bring Mdlle. de Cardoville to terms. With regard to
      Djalma&rsquo;s presence at the theatre, Rodin had learned from her maid,
      Florine, that her mistress was to go in the evening to the Porte-Saint
      Martin. Before Djalma had recognized her, Adrienne, who felt her strength
      failing her, was on the point of quitting the theatre; the man, whom she
      had hitherto placed so high, whom she had regarded as a hero and a
      demi-god and whom she had imagined plunged in such dreadful despair, that,
      led by the most tender pity, she had written to him with simple frankness,
      that a sweet hope might calm his grief&mdash;replied to a generous mark of
      sincerity and love, by making himself a ridiculous spectacle with a
      creature unworthy of him. What incurable wounds for Adrienne&rsquo;s
      pride! It mattered little, whether Djalma knew or not, that she would be a
      spectator of the indignity. But when she saw herself recognized by the
      prince, when he carried the insult so far as to look full at her, and, at
      the same time, raise to his lips the creature&rsquo;s bouquet who
      accompanied him, Adrienne was seized with noble indignation, and felt
      sufficient courage to remain: instead of closing her eyes to evidence, she
      found a sort of barbarous pleasure in assisting at the agony and death of
      her pure and divine love. With head erect, proud and flashing eye, flushed
      cheek, and curling lip, she looked in her turn at the prince with
      disdainful steadiness. It was with a sardonic smile that she said to the
      marchioness, who, like many others of the spectators was occupied with
      what was passing in the stage-box: &ldquo;This revolting exhibition of
      savage manners is at least in accordance with the rest of the performance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the marchioness; &ldquo;and my dear uncle
      will have lost, perhaps, the most amusing part.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Montbron?&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily, with hardly repressed
      bitterness; &ldquo;yes, he will regret not having seen all. I am impatient
      for his arrival. Is it not to him that I am indebted for his charming
      evening?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Madame de Morinval would have remarked the expression of bitter
      irony, that Adrienne could not altogether dissemble, if suddenly a hoarse
      and prolonged roar had net attracted her attention, as well as that of the
      rest of the audience, who had hitherto been quite indifferent to the
      scenes intended for an introduction to the appearance of Morok. Every eye
      was now turned instinctively towards the cavern situated to the left of
      the stage, just below Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s box; a thrill of
      curiosity ran through the house. A second roar, deeper and more sonorous,
      and apparently expressive of more irritation than the first, now rose from
      the cave, the mouth of which was half-hidden by artificial brambles, made
      so as to be easily put on one side. At this sound, the Englishman stood up
      in his little box, leaned half over the front, and began to rub his hands
      with great energy; then, remaining perfectly motionless, he fixed his
      large, green, glittering eyes on the mouth of the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these ferocious howlings, Djalma also had started, notwithstanding the
      frenzy of love, hate, and jealousy, to which he was a prey. The sight of
      this forest, and the roarings of the panther, filled him with deep
      emotion, for they recalled the remembrance of his country, and of those
      great hunts which, like war, have their own terrible excitement. Had he
      suddenly heard the horns and gongs of his father&rsquo;s army sounding to
      the charge, he could not have been transported with more savage ardor. And
      now deep growls, like distant thunder, almost drowned the roar of the
      panther. The lion and tiger, Judas and Cain answered her from their dens
      at the back of the stage. On this frightful concert, with which his ears
      had been familiar in the midst of the solitudes of India, when he lay
      encamped, for the purposes of the chase or of war, Djalma&rsquo;s blood
      boiled in his veins. His eyes sparkled with a wild ardor. Leaning a little
      forward, with both hands pressed on the front of the box, his whole body
      trembled with a convulsive shudder. The audience, the theatre, Adrienne
      herself no longer existed for him; he was in a forest of his own lands,
      tracking the tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there mingled with his beauty so intrepid and ferocious an
      expression, that Rose-Pompon looked at him with a sort of terror and
      passionate admiration. For the first time in her life, perhaps, her pretty
      blue eyes, generally so gay and mischievous; expressed a serious emotion.
      She could not explain what she felt; but her heart seemed frightened, and
      beat violently, as though some calamity were at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yielding to a movement of involuntary fear, she seized Djalma by the arm,
      and said to him: &ldquo;Do not stare so into that cavern; you frighten me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/20591.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Djalma did not hear what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is! here he is!&rdquo; murmured the crowd, almost with one
      voice, as Morok appeared at the back of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dressed as we have described, Morok now carried in addition a bow and a
      long quiver full of arrows. He slowly descended the line of painted rocks,
      which came sloping down towards the centre of the stage. From time to
      time, he stopped as if to listen, and appeared to advance with caution.
      Looking from one side to the other, his eyes involuntarily encountered the
      large, green eyes of the Englishman, whose box was close to the cavern.
      Instantly the lion-tamer&rsquo;s countenance was contracted in so
      frightful a manner, that Lady Morinval, who was examining him closely with
      the aid of an excellent glass, said hastily to Adrienne: &ldquo;My dear,
      the man is afraid. Some misfortune will happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can accidents happen,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a sardonic
      smile, &ldquo;in the midst of this brilliant crowd, so well dressed and
      full of animation! Misfortunes here, this evening! why, dear Julia, you do
      not think it. It is in darkness and solitude that misfortunes come&mdash;never
      in the midst of a joyous crowd, and in all this blaze of light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Adrienne! take care!&rdquo; cried the marchioness,
      unable to repress an exclamation of alarm, and seizing her arm, as if to
      draw her closer; &ldquo;do you not see it?&rdquo; And with a trembling
      hand, she pointed to the cavern&rsquo;s mouth. Adrienne hastily bent
      forward, and looked in that direction. &ldquo;Take care, do not lean so
      forward!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Morinval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your terrors are nonsensical, my dear,&rdquo; said the marquis to
      his wife. &ldquo;The panther is securely chained; and even were it to
      break its chains (which is impossible), we are here beyond its reach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A long murmur of trembling curiosity here ran through the house, and every
      eye was intently fixed on the cavern. From amongst the artificial
      brambles, which she abruptly pushed aside with her broad chest, the black
      panther suddenly appeared. Twice she stretched forth her flat head,
      illumined by yellow, flaming eyes; then, half-opening her blood-red jaws,
      she uttered another roar, and exhibited two rows of formidable fangs. A
      double iron chain, and a collar also of iron, painted black, blended with
      the ebon shades of her hide, and with the darkness of the cavern. The
      illusion was complete, and the terrible animal seemed to be at liberty in
      her den.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; said the marquis, suddenly, &ldquo;look at those
      Indians. Their emotion makes them superb!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the sight of the panther had raised the wild ardor of Djalma to
      its utmost pitch. His eyes sparkled in their pearly orbits like two black
      diamonds; his upper lip was curled convulsively with an expression of
      animal ferocity, as if he were in a violent paroxysm of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea, now leaning on the front of the box, was also greatly excited,
      by reason of a strange coincidence. &ldquo;That black panther of so rare a
      breed,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;which I see here at Paris, upon the
      stage, must be the very one that the Malay&rdquo;&mdash;the Thug who had
      tatooed Djalma at Java during his sleep&mdash;&ldquo;took quite young from
      his den, and sold to a European captain. Bowanee&rsquo;s power is
      everywhere!&rdquo; added the Thug, in his sanguinary superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think,&rdquo; resumed the marquis, addressing Adrienne,
      &ldquo;that those Indians are really splendid in their present attitude?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they may have seen such a hunt in their own country,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne, as if she would recall and brave the most cruel
      remembrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrienne,&rdquo; said the marchioness, suddenly, in an agitated
      voice, &ldquo;the lion-tamer has now come nearer&mdash;is not his
      countenance fearful to look at?&mdash;I tell you he is afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; observed the marquis, this time very seriously,
      &ldquo;he is dreadfully pale, and seems to grow worse every minute, the
      nearer he approaches this side. It is said that, were he to lose his
      presence of mind for a single moment, he would run the greatest danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! it would be horrible!&rdquo; cried the marchioness, addressing
      Adrienne, &ldquo;if he were wounded&mdash;there&mdash;under our eyes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every wound does not kill,&rdquo; replied her friend, with an
      accent of such cold indifference, that the marchioness looked at her with
      surprise, and said to her: &ldquo;My dear girl, what you say there is
      cruel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the air of the place that acts on me,&rdquo; answered
      Adrienne, with an icy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! look! the lion-tamer is about to shoot his arrow at the
      panther,&rdquo; said the marquis, suddenly. &ldquo;No doubt, he will next
      perform the hand to hand grapple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok was at this moment in front of the stage, but he had yet to traverse
      its entire breadth to reach the cavern&rsquo;s mouth. He stopped an
      instant, adjusted an arrow to the string, knelt down behind a mass of
      rock, took deliberate aim&mdash;and then the arrow hissed across the
      stage, and was lost in the depths of the cavern, into which the panther
      had retired, after showing for a moment her threatening head to the
      audience. Hardly had the arrow disappeared, than Death, purposely
      irritated by Goliath (who was invisible) sent forth a howl of rage, as if
      she had been really wounded. Morok&rsquo;s actions became so expressive,
      he evinced so naturally his joy at having hit the wild beast, that a
      tempest of applause burst from every quarter of the house. Then, throwing
      away his bow, he drew a dagger from his girdle, took it between his teeth,
      and began to crawl forward on hands and knees, as though he meant to
      surprise the wounded panther in his den. To render the illusion perfect,
      Death, again excited by Goliath, who struck him with an iron bar, sent
      forth frightful howlings from the depths of the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloomy aspect of the forest, only half-lighted with a reddish glare,
      was so effective&mdash;the howlings of the panther were so furious&mdash;the
      gestures, attitude, and countenance of Morok were so expressive of terror,
      that the audience, attentive and trembling, now maintained a profound
      silence. Every one held his breath, and a kind of shudder came over the
      spectators, as though they expected some horrible event. What gave such a
      fearful air of truth to the pantomime of Morok, was that, as he approached
      the cavern step by step, he approached also the Englishman&rsquo;s box. In
      spite of himself, the lion-tamer, fascinated by terror, could not take his
      eyes from the large green eyes of this man, and it seemed as if every one
      of the abrupt movements which he made in crawling along, was produced by a
      species of magnetic attraction, caused by the fixed gaze of the fatal
      wagerer. Therefore, the nearer Morok approached, the more ghastly and
      livid he became. At sight of this pantomime, which was no longer acting,
      but the real expression of intense fear, the deep and trembling silence
      which had reigned in the theatre was once more interrupted by
      acclamations, with which were mingled the roarings of the panther, and the
      distant growls of the lion and tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman leaned almost out of his box, with a frightful sardonic
      smile on his lip, and with his large eyes still fixed, panted for breath.
      The perspiration ran down his bald red forehead, as if he had really
      expended an incredible amount of magnetic power in attracting Morok, whom
      he now saw close to the cavern entrance. The moment was decisive.
      Crouching down with his dagger in his hand, following with eye and gesture
      Death&rsquo;s every movement, who, roaring furiously, and opening wide her
      enormous jaws, seemed determined to guard the entrance of her den, Morok
      waited for the moment to rush upon her. There is such fascination in
      danger, that Adrienne shared, in spite of herself, the feeling of painful
      curiosity, mixed with terror, that thrilled through all the spectators.
      Leaning forward like the marchioness, and gazing upon this scene of
      fearful interest, the lady still held mechanically in her hand the Indian
      bouquet preserved since the morning. Suddenly, Morok raised a wild shout,
      as he rushed towards Death, who answered this exclamation by a dreadful
      roar, and threw herself upon her master with so much fury, that Adrienne,
      in alarm, believing the man lost, drew herself back, and covered her fact
      with her hands. Her flowers slipped from her grasp, and, falling upon the
      stage, rolled into the cavern in which Morok was struggling with the
      panther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as lightning, supple and agile as a tiger, yielding to the
      intoxication of his love, and to the wild ardor excited in him by the
      roaring of the panther, Djalma sprang at one bound upon the stage, drew
      his dagger, and rushed into the cavern to recover Adrienne&rsquo;s
      nosegay. At that instant, Morok, being wounded, uttered a dreadful cry for
      help; the panther, rendered still more furious at sight of Djalma, make
      the most desperate efforts to break her chain. Unable to succeed in doing
      so, she rose upon her hind legs, in order to seize Djalma, then within
      reach of her sharp claws. It was only by bending down his head, throwing
      himself on his knees, and twice plunging his dagger into her belly with
      the rapidity of lightning, that Djalma escaped certain death. The panther
      gave a howl, and fell with her whole weight upon the prince. For a second,
      during which lasted her terrible agony, nothing was seen but a confused
      and convulsive mass of black limbs, and white garments stained with blood&mdash;and
      then Djalma rose, pale, bleeding, for he was wounded&mdash;and standing
      erect, his eye flashing with savage pride, his foot on the body of the
      panther, he held in his hand Adrienne&rsquo;s bouquet, and cast towards
      her a glance which told the intensity of his love. Then only did Adrienne
      feel her strength fail her&mdash;for only superhuman courage had enabled
      her to watch all the terrible incidents of the struggle.

      CHAPTER XV. THE CONSTANT WANDERER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is night. The
      moon shines and the stars glimmer in the midst of a serene but cheerless
      sky; the sharp whistlings of the north wind, that fatal, dry, and icy
      breeze, ever and anon burst forth in violent gusts. With its harsh and
      cutting breath, it sweeps Montmartre&rsquo;s Heights. On the highest point
      of the hills, a man is standing. His long shadow is cast upon the stony,
      moon-lit ground. He gazes on the immense city, which lies outspread
      beneath his feet. PARIS&mdash;with the dark outline of its towers,
      cupolas, domes, and steeples, standing out from the limpid blue of the
      horizon, while from the midst of the ocean of masonry, rises a luminous
      vapor, that reddens the starry azure of the sky. It is the distant
      reflection of the thousand fires, which at night, the hour of pleasures,
      light up so joyously the noisy capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the wayfarer; &ldquo;it is not to be. The Lord will
      not exact it. Is not twice enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five centuries ago, the avenging hand of the Almighty drove me
      hither from the uttermost confines of Asia. A solitary traveller, I had
      left behind me more grief, despair, disaster, and death, than the
      innumerable armies of a hundred devastating conquerors. I entered this
      town, and it too was decimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, two centuries ago, the inexorable hand, which leads me
      through the world, brought me once more hither; and then, as the time
      before, the plague, which the Almighty attaches to my steps, again ravaged
      this city, and fell first on my brethren, already worn out with labor and
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brethren&mdash;mine?&mdash;the cobbler of Jerusalem, the artisan
      accursed by the Lord, who, in my person, condemned the whole race of
      workmen, ever suffering, ever disinherited, ever in slavery, toiling on
      like me without rest or pause, without recompense or hope, till men,
      women, and children, young and old, all die beneath the same iron yoke&mdash;that
      murderous yoke, which others take in their turn, thus to be borne from age
      to age on the submissive and bruised shoulders of the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, for the third time in five centuries, I reach the summit
      of one of the hills that overlook the city. And perhaps I again bring with
      me fear, desolation, and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet this city, intoxicated with the sounds of its joys and its
      nocturnal revelries, does not know&mdash;oh! does not know that I am at
      its gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, no! my presence will not be a new calamity. The Lord, in
      his impenetrable views, has hitherto led me through France, so as to avoid
      the humblest hamlet; and the sound of the funeral knell has not
      accompanied my passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, moreover, the spectre has left me&mdash;the green, livid
      spectre, with its hollow, bloodshot eyes. When I touched the soil of
      France, its damp and icy hands was no longer clasped in mine&mdash;and it
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet&mdash;I feel that the atmosphere of death is around me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sharp whistlings of that fatal wind cease not, which, catching
      me in their whirl, seem to propagate blasting and mildew as they blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps the wrath of the Lord is appeased, and my presence here
      is only a threat&mdash;to be communicated in some way to those whom it
      should intimidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for otherwise he would smite with a fearful blow, by first
      scattering terror and death here in the heart of the country, in the bosom
      of this immense city!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no! the Lord will be merciful. No! he will not condemn me
      to this new torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! in this city, my brethren are more numerous and miserable
      than elsewhere. And should I be their messenger of death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! the Lord will have pity. For, alas! the seven descendants of my
      sister have at length met in this town. And to them likewise should I be
      the messenger of death, instead of the help they so much need?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that woman, who like me wanders from one border of the earth to
      the other, after having once more rent asunder the nets of their enemies,
      has gone forth upon her endless journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In vain she foresaw that new misfortunes threatened my sister&rsquo;s
      family. The invisible hand, that drives me on, drives her on also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carried away, as of old, by the irresistible whirlwind, at the
      moment of leaving my kindred to their fate, she in vain cried with
      supplicating tone: &lsquo;Let me at least, O Lord, complete my task!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;GO
      ON!&mdash;&lsquo;A few days, in mercy, only a few poor days!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;GO
      ON&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I leave those I love on the brink of the abyss!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;GO
      ON! GO ON!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the wandering star&mdash;again started on its eternal round.
      And her voice, passing through space, called me to the assistance of mine
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When that voice readied me, I knew that the descendants of my
      sister were still exposed to frightful perils. Those perils are even now
      on the increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, O Lord! will they escape the scourge, which for so many
      centuries has weighed down our race?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou pardon me in them? wilt thou punish me in them? Oh, that
      they might obey the last will of their ancestor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that they might join together their charitable hearts, their
      valor and their strength, their noble intelligence, and their great
      riches!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would then labor for the future happiness of humanity&mdash;they
      would thus, perhaps, redeem me from my eternal punishment!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words of the Son of Man, LOVE YE ONE ANOTHER, will be their
      only end, their only means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the help of those all-powerful words, they will fight and
      conquer the false priests, who have renounced the precepts of love, peace,
      and hope, for lessons of hatred, violence, and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those false priests, who, kept in pay by the powerful and happy of
      this world, their accomplices in every age, instead of asking here below
      for some slight share of well-being for my unfortunate brethren, dare in
      thy name, O Lord God, to assert that the poor are condemned to endless
      suffering in this world&mdash;and that the desire or the hope to suffer
      less is a crime in thine eyes&mdash;because the happiness of the few, and
      the misery of nearly the whole human race, is (O blasphemy!) according to
      thy will. Is not the very contrary of those murderous words alone worthy
      of divinity!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In mercy, hear me, Lord! Rescue from their enemies the descendants
      of my sister&mdash;the artisan as the king&rsquo;s son. Do not let them
      destroy the germ of so mighty and fruitful an association, which, with thy
      blessing, would make an epoch in the annals of human happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me unite them, O Lord, since others would divide them&mdash;defend
      them, since others attack; let me give hope to those who have ceased to
      hope, courage to those who are brought low with fear&mdash;let me raise up
      the falling, and sustain those who persevere in the way of the righteous!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, peradventure, their struggles, devotion, virtue, and grief,
      may expiate my fault&mdash;that of a man, whom misfortune alone rendered
      unjust and wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! since Thy Almighty hand hath led me hither&mdash;to what end I
      know not&mdash;lay aside Thy wrath, I beseech Thee&mdash;let me be no
      longer the instrument of Thy vengeance!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of woe upon the earth! for the last two years, Thy creatures
      have fallen by thousands upon my track. The world is decimated. A veil of
      mourning extends over all the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Asia to the icy Pole, they died upon the path of the wanderer.
      Dost Thou not hear the long-drawn sigh that rises from the earth unto
      Thee, O Lord?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy for all! mercy for me!&mdash;Let me but unite the descendants
      of my sister for a single day, and they will be saved!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced these words, the wayfarer sank upon his knees, and raised
      to heaven, his supplicating hands. Suddenly, the wind blew with redoubled
      violence; its sharp whistlings were changed into the roar of a tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller shuddered; in a voice of terror he exclaimed: &ldquo;The
      blast of death rises in its fury&mdash;the whirlwind carries me on&mdash;Lord!
      Thou art then deaf to my prayer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spectre! oh, the spectre! it is again here! its green face
      twitching with convulsive spasms&mdash;its red eyes rolling in their
      orbits. Begone! begone!&mdash;its hand, oh! its icy hand has again laid
      hold of mine. Have mercy, heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GO ON!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord! the pestilence&mdash;the terrible plague&mdash;must I
      carry it into this city?&mdash;And my brethren will perish the first&mdash;they,
      who are so sorely smitten even now! Mercy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GO ON!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the descendants of my sister. Mercy! Mercy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GO ON!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, have pity!&mdash;I can no longer keep my ground; the
      spectre drags me to the slope of the hill; my walk is rapid as the deadly
      blast that rages behind me; already do I behold the city gates. Have
      mercy, Lord, on the descendants of my sister! Spare them; do not make me
      their executioner; let them triumph over their enemies!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GO ON! GO ON!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ground flies beneath my feet; there is the city gate. Lord, it
      is yet time! Oh, mercy for that sleeping town! Let it not waken to cries
      of terror, despair, and death! Lord, I am on the threshold. Must it be?&mdash;Yes,
      it is done. Paris, the plague is in thy bosom. The curse&mdash;oh, the
      eternal curse!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI. THE LUNCHEON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he morning after
      the doomed traveller, descending the heights of Montmartre, had entered
      the walls of Paris, great activity reigned in St. Dizier House. Though it
      was hardly noon, the Princess de St. Dizier, without being exactly in full
      dress (she had too much taste for that), was yet arrayed with more care
      than usual. Her light hair, instead of being merely banded, was arranged
      in two bunches of curls, which suited very well with her full and florid
      cheeks. Her cap was trimmed with bright rose-colored ribbon, and whoever
      had seen the lady in her tight fitting dress of gray-watered silk would
      have easily guessed that Mrs. Grivois, her tirewoman, must have required
      the assistance and the efforts of another of the princess&rsquo;s women to
      achieve so remarkable a reduction in the ample figure of their mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall explain the edifying cause of this partial return to the vanities
      of the world. The princess, attended by Mrs. Grivois, who acted as
      housekeeper, was giving her final orders with regard to some preparations
      that were going on in a vast parlor. In the midst of this room was a large
      round table, covered with crimson velvet, and near it stood several
      chairs, amongst which, in the place of honor, was an arm chair of gilded
      wood. In one corner, not far from the chimney, in which burned an
      excellent fire, was a buffet. On it were the divers materials for a most
      dainty and exquisite collation. Upon silver dishes were piled pyramids of
      sandwiches composed of the roes of carp and anchovy paste, with slices of
      pickled tunny-fish and Lenigord truffles (it was in Lent); on silver
      dishes, placed over burning spirits of wine, so as to keep them very hot,
      tails of Meuse crawfish boiled in cream, smoked in golden colored pastry,
      and seemed to challenge comparison with delicious little Marennes
      oyster-patties, stewed in Madeira, and flavored with a seasoning of spiced
      sturgeon. By the side of these substantial dishes were some of a lighter
      character, such as pineapple tarts, strawberry-creams (it was early for
      such fruit), and orange-jelly served in the peel, which had been
      artistically emptied for that purpose. Bordeaux, Madeira, and Alicant
      sparkled like rubies and topazes in large glass decanters, while two
      Sevres ewers were filled, one with coffee a la creme, the other with
      vanilla chocolate, almost in the state of sherbet, from being plunged in a
      large cooler of chiselled silver, containing ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what gave to this dainty collation a singularly apostolic and papal
      character were sundry symbols of religious worship carefully represented.
      Thus there were charming little Calvaries in apricot paste, sacerdotal
      mitres in burnt almonds, episcopal croziers in sweet cake, to which the
      princess added, as a mark of delicate attention, a little cardinal&rsquo;s
      hat in cherry sweetmeat, ornamented with bands in burnt sugar. The most
      important, however, of these Catholic delicacies, the masterpiece of the
      cook, was a superb crucifix in angelica, with a crown of candied berries.
      These are strange profanations, which scandalize even the least devout.
      But, from the impudent juggle of the coat of Triers, down to the shameless
      jest of the shrine at Argenteuil, people, who are pious after the fashion
      of the princess, seem to take delight in bringing ridicule upon the most
      respectable traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After glancing with an air of satisfaction at these preparations for the
      collation, the lady said to Mrs. Grivois, as she pointed to the gilded
      arm-chair, which seemed destined for the president of the meeting: &ldquo;Is
      there a cushion under the table, for his Eminence to rest his feet on? He
      always complains of cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your highness,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, when she had looked
      under the table; &ldquo;the cushion is there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let also a pewter bottle be filled with boiling water, in case his
      Eminence should not find the cushion enough to keep his feet warm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And put some more wood on the fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my lady, it is already a very furnace. And if his Eminence is
      always too cold, my lord the Bishop of Halfagen is always too hot. He
      perspires dreadfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess shrugged her shoulders, and said to Mrs. Grivois: &ldquo;Is
      not his Eminence Cardinal Malipieri the superior of his Lordship the
      Bishop of Halfagen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, according to the rules of the hierarchy, it is for his
      Lordship to suffer from the heat, rather than his Eminence from the cold.
      Therefore, do as I tell you, and put more wood on the fire. Nothing is
      more natural; his Eminence being an Italian, and his Lordship coming from
      the north of Belgium, they are accustomed to different temperatures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as your highness pleases,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grivois, as she
      placed two enormous logs on the fire; &ldquo;but in such a heat as there
      is here his Lordship might really be suffocated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also find it too warm; but does not our holy religion teach us
      lessons of self-sacrifice and mortification?&rdquo; said the princess,
      with a touching expression of devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now explained the cause of the rather gay attire of the princess.
      She was preparing for a reception of prelates, who, along with Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and other dignitaries of the Church, had already held at the princely
      house a sort of council on a small scale. A young bride who gives her
      first ball, an emancipated minor who gives his first bachelor&rsquo;s
      dinner, a woman of talent who reads aloud for the first time her first
      unpublished work, are not more joyous and proud, and, at the same time,
      more attentive to their guests, than was this lady with her prelates. To
      behold great interests discussed in her house, and in her presence, to
      hear men of acknowledged ability ask her advice upon certain practical
      matters relating to the influence of female congregations, filled the
      princess with pride, as her claims to consideration were thus sanctioned
      by Lordships and Eminences, and she took the position, as it were, of a
      mother of the Church. Therefore, to win these prelates, whether native or
      foreign, she had recourse to no end of saintly flatteries and sanctified
      coaxing. Nor could anything be more logical than these successive
      transfigurations of this heartless woman, who only loved sincerely and
      passionately the pursuit of intrigue and domination. With the progress of
      age, she passed naturally from the intrigues of love to those of politics,
      and from the latter to those of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment she finished inspecting her preparations, the sound of
      coaches was heard in the courtyard, apprising her of the arrival of the
      persons she had been expecting. Doubtless, these persons were of the
      highest rank, for contrary to all custom, she went to receive them at the
      door of her outer saloon. It was, indeed, Cardinal Malipieri, who was
      always cold, with the Belgian Bishop of Halfagen, who was always hot. They
      were accompanied by Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. The Roman cardinal was a tall
      man, rather bony than thin, with a yellowish puffy countenance, haughty
      and full of craft; he squinted a good deal, and his black eyes were
      surrounded by a deep brown circle. The Belgian Bishop was short, thick,
      and fat, with a prominent abdomen, an apoplectic complexion, a slow,
      deliberate look, and a soft, dimpled, delicate hand.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30029m.jpg" alt="30029m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30029.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The company soon assembled in the great saloon. The cardinal instantly
      crept close to the fire, whilst the bishop, beginning to sweat and blow,
      cast longing glances at the iced chocolate and coffee, which were to aid
      him in sustaining the oppressive heat of the artificial dog-day. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      approaching the princess, said to her in a low voice: &ldquo;Will you give
      orders for the admittance of Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont, when he arrives?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that young priest then here?&rdquo; asked the princess, with
      extreme surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the day before yesterday. We had him sent for to Paris, by
      his superiors. You shall know all. As for Father Rodin, let Mrs. Grivois
      admit him, as the other day, by the little door of the back stairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has very important matters to communicate. He desires that both
      the cardinal and the bishop should be present for they have been informed
      of everything at Rome by the Superior General, in their quality of
      associates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess rang the bell, gave the necessary orders, and, returning
      towards the cardinal, said to him, in a tone of the most earnest
      solicitude: &ldquo;Does your Eminence begin to feel a little warmer? Would
      your Eminence like a bottle of hot water to your feet? Shall we make a
      larger fire for your Eminence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this proposition, the Belgian bishop, who was wiping the perspiration
      from his forehead, heaved a despairing sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, princess,&rdquo; answered the cardinal to her,
      in very good French, but with an intolerable Italian accent; &ldquo;I am
      really overcome with so much kindness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not your Lordship take some refreshment?&rdquo; said the
      princess to the bishop, as she turned towards the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your permission, madame, I will take a little iced coffee,&rdquo;
      said the prelate, making a prudent circuit to approach the dishes without
      passing before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will not your Eminence try one of these little oyster-patties?
      They are quite hot,&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them already, princess,&rdquo; said the cardinal, with the
      air and look of an epicure; &ldquo;they are delicious, and I cannot resist
      the temptation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wine shall I have the honor to offer your Eminence?&rdquo;
      resumed the princess, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little claret, if you please, madame;&rdquo; and as Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      prepared to fill the cardinal&rsquo;s glass, the princess disputed with
      him that pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence will doubtless approve what I have done,&rdquo; said
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to the cardinal, whilst the latter was gravely
      despatching the oyster-patties, &ldquo;in not summoning for to-day the
      Bishop of Mogador, the Archbishop of Nanterre, and our holy Mother
      Perpetue, the lady-superior of St. Mary Convent, the interview we are
      about to have with his Reverence Father Rodin and Abbe Gabriel being
      altogether private and confidential.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our good father was perfectly right,&rdquo; said the cardinal;
      &ldquo;for, though the possible consequences of this Rennepont affair may
      interest the whole Church, there are some things that are as well kept
      secret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must seize this opportunity to thank your Eminence for
      having deigned to make an exception in favor of a very obscure and humble
      servant of the Church,&rdquo; said the princess to the cardinal, with a
      very deep and respectful curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only just and right, madame,&rdquo; replied the cardinal,
      bowing as he replaced his empty glass upon the table; &ldquo;we know how
      much the Church is indebted to you for the salutary direction you give to
      the religious institutions of which you are the patroness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With regard to that, your Eminence may be assured that I always
      refuse assistance to any poor person who cannot produce a certificate from
      the confessional.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is only thus, madame,&rdquo; resumed the cardinal, this time
      allowing himself to be tempted by the attractions of the crawfish&rsquo;s
      tails, &ldquo;it is only thus that charity has any meaning. I care little
      that the irreligious should feel hunger, but with the pious it is
      different;&rdquo; and the prelate gayly swallowed a mouthful. &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo;
      resumed he, &ldquo;it is well known with what ardent zeal you pursue the
      impious, and those who are rebels against the authority of our Holy
      Father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence may feel convinced that I am Roman in heart and soul;
      I see no difference between a Gallican and a Turk,&rdquo; said the
      princess, bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The princess is right,&rdquo; said the Belgian bishop: &ldquo;I
      will go further, and assert that a Gallican should be more odious to the
      church than a pagan. In this respect I am of the opinion of Louis XIV.
      They asked him a favor for a man about the court. &lsquo;Never,&rsquo;
      said the great king; &lsquo;this person is a Jansenist.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No,
      sire; he is an atheist.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! that is different; I will
      grant what he asks,&rsquo; said the King.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This little episcopal jest made them all laugh. After which Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      resumed seriously, addressing the cardinal: &ldquo;Unfortunately, as I was
      about to observe to your Eminence with regard to the Abbe Gabriel, unless
      they are very narrowly watched, the lower clergy have a tendency to become
      infected with dissenting views, and with ideas of rebellion against what
      they call the despotism of the bishops.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man must be a Catholic Luther!&rdquo; said the bishop.
      And, walking on tip-toe, he went to pour himself out a glorious glass of
      Madeira, in which he soaked some sweet cake, made in the form of a
      crozier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Led by his example, the Cardinal, under pretence of warming his feet by
      drawing still closer to the fire, helped himself to an excellent glass of
      old Malaga, which he swallowed by mouthfuls, with an air of profound
      meditation; after which he resumed: &ldquo;So this Abbe Gabriel starts as
      a reformer. He must be an ambitious man. Is he dangerous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By our advice his superiors have judged him to be so. They have
      ordered him to come hither. He will soon be here, and I will tell your
      Eminence why I have sent for him. But first, I have a note on the
      dangerous tendencies of the Abbe Gabriel. Certain questions were addressed
      to him, with regard to some of his acts, and it was in consequence of his
      answers that his superiors recalled him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, took from his pocket-book a paper,
      which he read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Question.&mdash;Is it true that you performed religious
      rites for an inhabitant of your parish who died in final impenitence of
      the most detestable kind, since he had committed suicide?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Answer of Abbe Gabriel.&mdash;I paid him the last duties,
      because, more than any one else, because of his guilty end, he required
      the prayers of the church. During the night which followed his interment I
      continually implored for him the divine mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Q.&mdash;Is it true that you refused a set of silver-gilt
      sacramental vessels, and other ornaments, with which one of the faithful,
      in pious zeal, wished to endow your parish?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A.&mdash;I refused the vessels and embellishments, because
      the house of the Lord should be plain and without ornament, so as to
      remind the faithful that the divine Saviour was born in a stable. I
      advised the person who wished to make these useless presents to my parish
      to employ the money in judicious almsgiving, assuring him it would be more
      agreeable to the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bitter and violent declamation against the adorning of our
      temples!&rdquo; cried the cardinal. &ldquo;This young priest is most
      dangerous. Continue, my good father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in his indignation, his Eminence swallowed several mouthfuls of
      strawberry-cream. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Q.&mdash;Is it true that you received in your parsonage, and
      kept there for some days, an inhabitant of the village, by birth a Swiss,
      belonging to the Protestant communion? Is it true that not only you did
      not attempt to convert him to the one Catholic and Apostolic faith, but
      that you carried so far the neglect of your sacred duties as to inter this
      heretic in the ground consecrated for the repose of true believers?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A.&mdash;One of my brethren was houseless. His life had been
      honest and laborious. In his old age his strength had failed him, and
      sickness had come at the back of it; almost in a dying state, he had been
      driven from his humble dwelling by a pitiless landlord, to whom he owed a
      year&rsquo;s rent. I received the old man in my house, and soothed his
      last days. The poor creature had toiled and suffered all his life; dying,
      he uttered no word of bitterness at his hard fate; he recommended his soul
      to God and piously kissed the crucifix. His pure and simple spirit
      returned to the bosom of its Creator. I closed his eyes with respect, I
      buried him, I prayed for him; and, though he died in the Protestant faith,
      I thought him worthy of a place in consecrated ground.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse and worse!&rdquo; said the cardinal. &ldquo;This tolerance is
      monstrous. It is a horrible attack on that maxim of Catholicism: &lsquo;Out
      of the pale of the Church there is no salvation.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all this is the more serious, my lord,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;because the mildness, charity, and Christian devotion of Abbe
      Gabriel have excited, not only in his parish, but in all the surrounding
      districts, the greatest enthusiasm. The priests of the neighboring
      parishes have yielded to the general impulse, and it must be confessed
      that but for his moderation a wide-spread schism would have commenced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you hope will result from bringing him here?&rdquo;
      said the prelate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The position of Abbe Gabriel is complicated; first of all, he is
      the heir of the Rennepont family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But has he not ceded his rights?&rdquo; asked the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord; and this cession, which was at first informal, has
      lately, with his free consent, been made perfectly regular in law; for he
      had sworn, happen what might, to renounce his part of the inheritance in
      favor of the Society of Jesus. Nevertheless, his Reverence Father Rodin
      thinks, that if your Eminence, after explaining to Abbe Gabriel that he
      was about to be recalled by his superiors, were to propose to him some
      eminent position at Rome, he might be induced to leave France, and we
      might succeed in arousing within him those sentiments of ambition which
      are doubtless only sleeping for the present; your Eminence, having
      observed, very judiciously, that every reformer must be ambitious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I approve of this idea,&rdquo; said the cardinal, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection; &ldquo;with his merit and power of acting on other men, Abbe
      Gabriel may rise very high, if he is docile; and if he should not be so,
      it is better for the safety of the Church that he should be at Rome than
      here&mdash;for you know, my good father, we have securities that are
      unfortunately wanting in France.&rdquo;(36)
    </p>
    <p>
      After some moments of silence, the cardinal said suddenly to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
      &ldquo;As we were talking of Father Rodin, tell me frankly what you think
      of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Eminence knows his capacity,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a constrained and suspicious air; &ldquo;our reverend Father-General&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commissioned him to take your place,&rdquo; said the cardinal;
      &ldquo;I know that. He told me so at Rome. But what do you think of the
      character of Father Rodin? Can one have full confidence in him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has so complete, so original, so secret, and so impenetrable a
      mind,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with hesitation, &ldquo;that it
      is difficult to form any certain judgment with respect to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think him ambitious?&rdquo; said the cardinal, after another
      moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Do you not suppose him capable of having
      other views than those of the greater glory of his Order?&mdash;Come, I
      have reasons for speaking thus,&rdquo; added the prelate, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, not without suspicion,
      for the game is played cautiously between people of the same craft,
      &ldquo;what should your Eminence think of him, either from your own
      observation, or from the report of the Father-General?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;that if his apparent devotion to his Order really
      concealed some after-thought&mdash;it would be well to discover it&mdash;for,
      with the influence that he has obtained at Rome (as I have found out), he
      might one day, and that shortly, become very formidable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, impelled by his
      jealousy of Rodin; &ldquo;I am, in this respect, of the same opinion as
      your Eminence; for I have sometimes perceived in him flashes of ambition,
      that were as alarming as they were extraordinary&mdash;and since I must
      tell all to your Eminence&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny was unable to continue; at this moment Mrs.
      Grivois, who had been knocking at the door, half-opened it, and made a
      sign to her mistress. The princess answered by bowing her head, and Mrs.
      Grivois again withdrew. A second afterwards Rodin entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      (36) It is known that, in 1845, the Inquisition, solitary confinement,
      etc., still existed at Rome.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. RENDERING THE ACCOUNT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t sight of Rodin,
      the two prelates and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny rose spontaneously, so much
      were they overawed by the real superiority of this man; their faces, just
      before contracted with suspicion and jealousy, suddenly brightened up, and
      seemed to smile on the reverend father with affectionate deference. The
      princess advanced some steps to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, badly dressed as ever, leaving on the soft carpet the muddy track
      of his clumsy shoes, put his umbrella into one corner, and advanced
      towards the table&mdash;not with his accustomed humility, but with slow
      step, uplifted head, and steady glance; not only did he feel himself in
      the midst of his partisans, but he knew that he could rule them all by the
      power of his intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of your reverence, my dear, good father,&rdquo;
      said the cardinal, with charming affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Rodin, looking fixedly at the prelate; &ldquo;and
      what were you saying?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the Belgian bishop, wiping his forehead,
      &ldquo;all the good that can be said of your reverence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not take something, my good father?&rdquo; said the
      princess to Rodin, as she pointed to the splendid sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, madame, I have eaten my radish already this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My secretary, Abbe Berlini, who was present at your repast, was,
      indeed, much astonished at your reverence&rsquo;s frugality,&rdquo; said
      the prelate: &ldquo;it is worthy of an anchorite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we talk of business,&rdquo; said Rodin, abruptly, like a
      man accustomed to lead and control the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall always be most happy to hear you,&rdquo; said the prelate.
      &ldquo;Your reverence yourself fixed to-day to talk over this great
      Rennepont affair. It is of such importance, that it was partly the cause
      of my journey to France; for to support the interests of the glorious
      Company of Jesus, with which I have the honor of being associated, is to
      support the interests of Rome itself, and I promised the reverend
      Father-General that I would place myself entirely at your orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only repeat what his Eminence has just said,&rdquo; added the
      bishop. &ldquo;We set out from Rome together, and our ideas are just the
      same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Rodin, addressing the cardinal, &ldquo;your
      Eminence may serve our cause, and that materially. I will tell you how
      presently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing the princess, he continued: &ldquo;I have desired Dr.
      Baleinier to come here, madame, for it will be well to inform him of
      certain things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be admitted as usual,&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Rodin&rsquo;s arrival Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had remained silent;
      he seemed occupied with bitter thoughts, and with some violent internal
      struggle. At last, half rising, he said to the prelate, in a forced tone
      of voice: &ldquo;I will not ask your Eminence to judge between the
      reverend Father Rodin and myself. Our General has pronounced, and I have
      obeyed. But, as your Eminence will soon see our superior, I should wish
      that you would grant me the favor to report faithfully the answers of
      Father Rodin to one or two questions I am about to put to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prelate bowed. Rodin looked at Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny with an air of
      surprise, and said to him, dryly: &ldquo;The thing is decided. What is the
      use of questions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to justify myself,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;but to place matters in their true light before his Eminence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, then; but let us have no useless speeches,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, drawing out his large silver watch, and looking at it. &ldquo;By
      two o&rsquo;clock I must be at Saint-Sulpice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be as brief as possible,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with repressed resentment. Then, addressing Rodin, he resumed: &ldquo;When
      your reverence thought fit to take my place, and to blame, very severely
      perhaps, the manner in which I had managed the interests confided to my
      care, I confess honestly that these interests were gravely compromised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromised?&rdquo; said Rodin, ironically; &ldquo;you mean lost.
      Did you not order me to write to Rome, to bid them renounce all hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then a desperate case, given up by the best doctors,&rdquo;
      continued Rodin, with irony, &ldquo;and yet I have undertaken to restore
      it to life. Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, plunging both hands into the pockets of his trousers, he looked
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny full in the face.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30037m.jpg" alt="30037m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30037.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reverence blamed me harshly,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;not for having sought, by every possible means, to recover the
      property odiously diverted from our society&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All your casuists authorize you to do so,&rdquo; said the cardinal;
      &ldquo;the texts are clear and positive; you have a right to recover; per
      fas aut nefas what has been treacherously taken from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;Father
      Rodin only reproached me with the military roughness of my means. &lsquo;Their
      violence,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was in dangerous opposition to the
      manners of the age.&rsquo; Be it so; but first of all, I could not be
      exposed to any legal proceedings, and, but for one fatal circumstance,
      success would have crowned the course I had taken, however rough and
      brutal it may appear. Now, may I ask your reverence what&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have done more than you?&rdquo; said Rodin to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      giving way to his impertinent habit of interrupting people; &ldquo;what I
      have done better than you?&mdash;what step I have taken in the Rennepont
      affair, since I received it from you in a desperate condition? Is that
      what you wish to know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I confess,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, in a sardonic tone, &ldquo;just
      as you did great things, coarse things, turbulent things, I have been
      doing little, puerile, secret things. Oh, heaven! you cannot imagine what
      a foolish part I, who passed for a man of enlarged views, have been acting
      for the last six weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have allowed myself to address such a reproach to
      your reverence, however deserved it may appear,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a bitter smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reproach?&rdquo; said Rodin, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;a
      reproach? You shall be the judge. Do you know what I wrote about you, some
      six weeks ago? Here it is: &lsquo;Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny has excellent
      qualities. He will be of much service to me&rsquo;&mdash;and from
      to-morrow I shall employ you very actively, added Rodin, by way of
      parenthesis&mdash;&lsquo;but he is not great enough to know how to make
      himself little on occasion.&rsquo; Do you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse for you,&rdquo; answered Rodin; &ldquo;it only
      proves that I was right. Well, since I must tell you, I have been wise
      enough to play the most foolish part for six whole weeks. Yes, I have
      chatted nonsense with a grisette&mdash;have talked of liberty, progress,
      humanity, emancipation of women, with a young, excited girl; of Napoleon
      the Great, and all sorts of Bonapartist idolatry, with an old, imbecile
      soldier; of imperial glory, humiliation of France, hopes in the King of
      Rome, with a certain marshal of France, who, with a heart full of
      adoration for the robber of thrones, that was transported to Saint-Helena,
      has a head as hollow and sonorous as a trumpet, into which you have only
      to blow some warlike or patriotic notes, and it will flourish away of
      itself, without knowing why or how. More than all this, I have talked of
      love affairs with a young tiger. When I told you it was lamentable to see
      a man of any intelligence descend, as I have done, to all such petty ways
      of connecting the thousand threads of this dark web, was I not right? Is
      it not a fine spectacle to see the spider obstinately weaving its net?&mdash;to
      see the ugly little black animal crossing thread upon thread, fastening it
      here, strengthening it there, and again lengthening it in some other
      place? You shrug your shoulders in pity; but return two hours after&mdash;what
      will you find? The little black animal eating its fill, and in its web a
      dozen of the foolish flies, bound so securely, that the little black
      animal has only to choose the moment of its repast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered those words, Rodin smiled strangely; his eyes, gradually
      half closed, opened to their full width, and seemed to shine more than
      usual. The Jesuit felt a sort of feverish excitement, which he attributed
      to the contest in which he had engaged before these eminent personages,
      who already felt the influence of his original and cutting speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny began to regret having entered on the contest. He
      resumed, however, with ill-repressed irony: &ldquo;I do not dispute the
      smallness of your means. I agree with you, they are very puerile&mdash;they
      are even very vulgar. But that is not quite sufficient to give an exalted
      notion of your merit. May I be allowed to ask&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What these means have produced?&rdquo; resumed Rodin, with an
      excitement that was not usual with him. &ldquo;Look into my spider&rsquo;s
      web, and you will see there the beautiful and insolent young girl, so
      proud, six weeks ago, of her grace, mind, and audacity&mdash;now pale,
      trembling, mortally wounded at the heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the act of chivalrous intrepidity of the Indian prince, with
      which all Paris is ringing,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;must surely
      have touched Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I have paralyzed the effect of that stupid and savage
      devotion, by demonstrating to the young lady that it is not sufficient to
      kill black panthers to prove one&rsquo;s self a susceptible, delicate, and
      faithful lover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny; &ldquo;we will admit
      the fact that Mdlle. de Cardoville is wounded to the heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does this prove with regard to the Rennepont affair?&rdquo;
      asked the cardinal, with curiosity, as he leaned his elbows on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There results from it,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;that when our most
      dangerous enemy is mortally wounded, she abandons the battlefield. That is
      something, I should imagine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;the talents and audacity
      of Mdlle. de Cardoville would make her the soul of the coalition formed
      against us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, obstinately;
      &ldquo;she may be no longer formidable in that respect. But the wound in
      her heart will not prevent her from inheriting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who tells you so?&rdquo; asked Rodin, coldly, and with assurance.
      &ldquo;Do you know why I have taken such pains, first to bring her in
      contact with Djalma, and then to separate her from him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I ask you,&rdquo; said Father D&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;how can this storm of passion prevent Mdlle. de Cardoville and the
      prince from inheriting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it from the serene, or from the stormy sky, that darts the
      destroying thunderbolt?&rdquo; said Rodin, disdainfully. &ldquo;Be
      satisfied; I shall know where to place the conductor. As for M. Hardy, the
      man lived for three things: his workmen, his friend, his mistress. He has
      been thrice wounded in the heart. I always take aim at the heart; it is
      legal and sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is legal, and sure, and praiseworthy,&rdquo; said the bishop;
      &ldquo;for, if I understand you rightly, this manufacturer had a
      concubine; now it is well to make use of an evil passion for the
      punishment of the wicked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, quite true,&rdquo; added the cardinal; &ldquo;if they have
      evil passion for us to make use of it, it is their own fault.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our holy Mother Perpetue,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;took
      every means to discover this abominable adultery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, M. Hardy is wounded in his dearest affections, I admit,&rdquo;
      said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, still disputing every inch of ground;
      &ldquo;ruined too in his fortune, which will only make him the more eager
      after this inheritance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument appeared of weight to the two prelates and the princess; all
      looked at Rodin with anxious curiosity. Instead of answering he walked up
      to the sideboard, and, contrary to his habits of stoical sobriety, and in
      spite of his repugnance for wine, he examined the decanters, and said:
      &ldquo;What is there in them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claret and sherry,&rdquo; said the hostess, much astonished at the
      sudden taste of Rodin, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter took a decanter at hazard, and poured out a glass of Madeira,
      which he drank off at a draught. Just be fore he had felt a strange kind
      of shivering; to this had succeeded a sort of weakness. He hoped the wine
      would revive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wiping his mouth with the back of his dirty hand, he returned to the
      table, and said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: &ldquo;What did you tell me
      about M. Hardy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being ruined in fortune, he would be the more eager to obtain
      this immense inheritance,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      inwardly much offended at the imperious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy think of money?&rdquo; said Rodin, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;He is indifferent to life, plunged in a stupor from
      which he only starts to burst into tears. Then he speaks with mechanical
      kindness to those about him. I have placed him in good hands. He begins,
      however, to be sensible to the attentions shown him, for he is good,
      excellent, weak; and ii is to this excellence, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      that you must appeal to finish the work in hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and then you will find that the result I have obtained is
      considerable, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin paused, and, pressing his hand to his forehead, said to himself:
      &ldquo;It is strange!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said the princess, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, madame,&rdquo; answered Rodin, with a shiver; &ldquo;it is
      doubtless the wine I drank; I am not accustomed to it. I feel a slight
      headache; but it will pass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes are very bloodshot, my good father, said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have looked too closely into my web,&rdquo; answered the Jesuit,
      with a sinister smile; &ldquo;and I must look again, to make Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      who pretends to be blind, catch a glimpse of my other flies. The two
      daughters of Marshal Simon, for instance, growing sadder and more dejected
      every day, at the icy barrier raised between them and their father; and
      the latter thinking himself one day dishonored if he does this, another if
      he does that; so that the hero of the Empire has become weaker and more
      irresolute than a child. What more remains of this impious family? Jacques
      Rennepont? Ask Morok, to what a state of debasement intemperance has
      reduced him, and towards what an abyss he is rushing!&mdash;There is my
      occurrence-sheet; you see to what are reduced all the members of this
      family, who, six weeks ago, had each elements of strength and union!
      Behold these Renneponts, who, by the will of their heretical ancestor,
      were to unite their forces to combat and crush our Society!&mdash;There
      was good reason to fear them; but what did I say? That I would act upon
      their passions. What have I done? I have acted upon their passions. At
      this hour they are vainly struggling in my web&mdash;they are mine&mdash;they
      are mine&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was speaking, Rodin&rsquo;s countenance and voice had undergone a
      singular alteration; his complexion, generally so cadaverous, had become
      flushed, but unequally, and in patches; then, strange phenomenon! his eyes
      grew both more brilliant and more sunken, and his voice sharper and
      louder. The change in the countenance of Rodin, of which he did not appear
      to be conscious, was so remarkable, that the other actors in this scene
      looked at him with a sort of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deceived as to the cause of this impression, Rodin exclaimed with
      indignation, in a voice interrupted by deep gaspings for breath: &ldquo;It
      is pity for this impious race, that I read upon your faces? Pity for the
      young girl, who never enters a church, and erects pagan altars in her
      habitation? Pity for Hardy, the sentimental blasphemer, the philanthropic
      atheist, who had no chapel in his factory, and dared to blend the names of
      Socrates, Marcus, Aurelius, and Plato, with our Savior&rsquo;s? Pity for
      the Indian worshipper of Brahma? Pity for the two sisters, who have never
      even been baptized? Pity for that brute, Jacques Rennepont? Pity for the
      stupid imperial soldier, who has Napoleon for his god, and the bulletins
      of the Grand Army for his gospel? Pity for this family of renegades, whose
      ancestor, a relapsed heretic, not content with robbing us of our property,
      excites from his tomb, at the end of a century and a half, his cursed race
      to lift their heads against us? What! to defend ourselves from these
      vipers, we shall not have the right to crush them in their own venom?&mdash;I
      tell you, that it is to serve heaven, and to give a salutary example to
      the world, to devote, by unchaining their own passions, this impious
      family to grief and despair and death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke thus, Rodin was dreadful in his ferocity; the fire of his eyes
      became still more brilliant; his lips were dry and burning, a cold sweat
      bathed his temples, which could be seen throbbing; an icy shudder ran
      through his frame. Attributing these symptoms to fatigue from writing
      through a portion of the night, and wishing to avoid fainting, he went to
      the sideboard, filled another glass with wine, which he drank off at a
      draught, and returned as the cardinal said to him: &ldquo;If your course
      with regard to this family needed justification, my good father, your last
      word would have victoriously justified it. Not only are you right,
      according to your own casuists, but there is nothing in your proceedings
      contrary to human laws. As for the divine law, it is pleasing to the Lord
      to destroy impiety with its own weapons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Conquered, as well as the others, by Rodin&rsquo;s diabolical assurance,
      and brought back to a kind of fearful admiration, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      said to him: &ldquo;I confess I was wrong in doubting the judgment of your
      reverence. Deceived by the appearance of the means employed, I could not
      judge of their connection, and above all, of their results. I now see,
      that, thanks to you, success is no longer doubtful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an exaggeration,&rdquo; replied Rodin, with feverish
      impatience; &ldquo;all these passions are at work, but the moment is
      critical. As the alchemist bends over the crucible, which may give him
      either treasures or sudden death&mdash;I alone at this moment&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin did not finish the sentence. He pressed both his hands to his
      forehead, with a stifled cry of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;For
      some moments you have been growing fearfully pale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know &lsquo;what is the matter,&rdquo; said Rodin, in an
      altered voice; &ldquo;my headache increases&mdash;I am seized with a sort
      of giddiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the princess, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take something,&rdquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be nothing,&rdquo; said Rodin, with an effort; &ldquo;I am
      no milksop, thank heaven!&mdash;I had little sleep last night; it is
      fatigue&mdash;nothing more. I was saying, that I alone could now direct
      this affair: but I cannot execute the plan myself. I must keep out of the
      way, and watch in the shade: I must hold the threads, which I alone can
      manage,&rdquo; added Rodin, in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good father,&rdquo; said the cardinal uneasily, &ldquo;I assure
      you that you are very unwell. Your paleness is becoming livid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; answered Rodin, courageously; &ldquo;but I
      am not to be so soon conquered. To return to our affair&mdash;this is the
      time, in which your qualities, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, will turn to good
      account. I have never denied them, and they may now be of the greatest
      use. You have the power of charming&mdash;grace&mdash;eloquence&mdash;you
      must&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin paused again. A cold sweat poured from his forehead. He felt his
      legs give way under him, notwithstanding his obstinate energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, I am not well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;yet, this morning,
      I was as well as ever. I shiver. I am icy cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw near the fire&mdash;it is a sudden indisposition,&rdquo; said
      the bishop, offering his arm with heroic devotion; &ldquo;it will not be
      anything of consequence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to take something warm, a cup of tea,&rdquo; said the
      princess; &ldquo;Dr. Baleinier will be here directly&mdash;he will
      reassure us as to this&mdash;indisposition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really inexplicable,&rdquo; said the prelate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words of the cardinal, Rodin, who had advanced with difficulty
      towards the fire, turned his eyes upon the prelate, and looked at him
      fixedly in a strange manner, for about a second; then, strong in his
      unconquerable energy, notwithstanding the change in his features, which
      were now visibly disfigured, Rodin said, in a broken voice, which he tried
      to make firm: &ldquo;The fire has warmed me; it will be nothing. I have no
      time to coddle myself. It would be a pretty thing to fall ill just as the
      Rennepont affair can only succeed by my exertions! Let us return to
      business. I told you, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, that you might serve us a
      good deal; and you also, princess, who have espoused this cause as if it
      were your own&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30045m.jpg" alt="30045m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30045.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Rodin again paused. This time he uttered a piercing cry, sank upon a chair
      placed near him, and throwing himself back convulsively, he pressed his
      hands to his chest, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh! what pain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (dreadful sight!) a cadaverous decomposition, rapid as thought, took
      place in Rodin&rsquo;s features. His hollow eyes were filled with blood,
      and seemed to shrink back in their orbits, which formed, as it were, two
      dark holes, in the centre of which blazed points of fire; nervous
      convulsions drew the flabby, damp, and icy skin tight over the bony
      prominences of the face, which was becoming rapidly green. From the lips,
      writhing with pain, issued the struggling breath, mingled with the words:
      &ldquo;Oh! I suffer! I burn!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, yielding to a transport of fury. Rodin tore with his nails his naked
      chest, for he had twisted off the buttons of his waistcoat, and rent his
      black and filthy shirt-front, as if the pressure of those garments
      augmented the violence of the pain under which he was writhing. The
      bishop, the cardinal, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, hastily approached
      Rodin, to try and hold him; he was seized with horrible convulsions; but,
      suddenly, collecting all his strength, he rose upon his feet stiff as a
      corpse. Then, with his garments in disorder, his thin, gray hair standing
      up all around his greenish face, fixing his red and flaming eyes upon the
      cardinal, he seized him with convulsive grasp, and exclaimed in a terrible
      voice, half stifled in his throat: &ldquo;Cardinal Malipieri&mdash;this
      illness is too sudden&mdash;they suspect me at Rome&mdash;you are of the
      race of the Borgias&mdash;and your secretary was with me this morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy man! what does he dare insinuate?&rdquo; cried the prelate,
      as amazed as he was indignant at the accusation. So saying, the cardinal
      strove to free himself from the grasp of Rodin, whose fingers were now as
      stiff as iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am poisoned!&rdquo; muttered Rodin, and sinking back, he fell
      into the arms of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his alarm, the cardinal had time to whisper to the latter:
      &ldquo;He thinks himself poisoned. He must therefore be plotting something
      very dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room opened. It was Dr. Baleinier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, doctor!&rdquo; cried the princess, as she ran pale and
      frightened towards him; &ldquo;Father Rodin has been suddenly attacked
      with terrible convulsions. Quick! quick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Convulsions? oh! it will be nothing, madame,&rdquo; said the
      doctor, throwing down his hat upon a chair, and hastily approaching the
      group which surrounded the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the doctor!&rdquo; cried the princess. All stepped aside,
      except Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who continued to support Rodin, leaning
      against a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! what symptoms!&rdquo; cried Dr. Baleinier, examining with
      growing terror the countenance of Rodin, which from green was turning
      blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked all the spectators, with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; repeated the doctor, drawing back as if he had
      trodden upon a serpent. &ldquo;It is the cholera! and contagious!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this frightful, magic word, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny abandoned his hold
      of Rodin, who rolled upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is lost!&rdquo; cried Dr. Baleinier. &ldquo;But I will run to
      fetch the means for a last effort.&rdquo; And he rushed towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess de Saint-Dizier, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, the bishop, and the
      cardinal followed in terror the flight of Dr. Baleinier. They all pressed
      to the door, which, in their consternation, they could not open. It opened
      at last but from without&mdash;and Gabriel appeared upon the threshold.
      Gabriel, the type of the true priest, the holy, the evangelical minister,
      to whom we can never pay enough of respect and ardent sympathy, and tender
      admiration. His angelic countenance, in its mild serenity, offered a
      striking contrast of these faces, all disturbed and contracted with
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young priest was nearly thrown down by the fugitives, who rushed
      through the now open doorway, exclaiming: &ldquo;Do not go in! he is dying
      of the cholera. Fly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, pushing back the bishop, who, being the last, was trying
      to force a passage, Gabriel ran towards Rodin, while the prelate succeeded
      in making his escape. Rodin, stretched upon the carpet, his limbs twisted
      with fearful cramps, was writhing in the extremity of pain. The violence
      of his fall had, no doubt, roused him to consciousness, for he moaned, in
      a sepulchral voice: &ldquo;They leave me to die&mdash;like a dog&mdash;the
      cowards!&mdash;Help!&mdash;no one&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dying man, rolling on his back with a convulsive movement, turned
      towards the ceiling a face on which was branded the infernal despair of
      the damned, as he once more repeated: &ldquo;No one!&mdash;not one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, which suddenly flamed with fury, just then met the large blue
      eyes of the angelic and mild countenance of Gabriel who, kneeling beside
      him, said to him, in his soft, grave tones: &ldquo;I am here, father&mdash;to
      help you, if help be possible&mdash;to pray for you, if God calls you to
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; murmured Rodin, with failing voice; &ldquo;forgive
      me for the evil I have done you&mdash;do not leave me&mdash;do not&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin could not finish; he had succeeded in raising himself into a sitting
      posture; he now uttered a loud cry, and fell back without sense or motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day it was announced in the evening papers: &ldquo;The cholera
      has broken out in Paris. The first case declared itself this day, at half
      past three, P.M. in the Rue de Babylone, at Saint-Dizier House.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII. THE SQUARE OF NOTRE DAME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> week had passed
      since Rodin was seized with the cholera, and its ravages had continually
      increased. That was an awful time! A funeral pall was spread over Paris,
      once so gay. And yet, never had the sky been of a more settled, purer
      blue; never had the sun shone more brilliantly. The inexorable serenity of
      nature, during the ravages of the deadly scourge, offered a strange and
      mysterious contrast. The flaunting light of the dazzling sunshine fell
      full upon the features, contracted by a thousand agonizing fears. Each
      trembled for himself, or for those dear to him; every countenance was
      stamped with an expression of feverish astonishment and dread. People
      walked with rapid steps, as if they would escape from the fate which
      threatened them; besides, they were in haste to return to their homes, for
      often they left life, health, happiness, and, two hours later, they found
      agony, death, and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every moment, new dismal objects met the view. Sometimes carts passed
      along, filled with coffins, symmetrically piled; they stopped before every
      house. Men in black and gray garments were in waiting before the door;
      they held out their hands, and to some, one coffin was thrown, to some
      two, frequently three or four, from the same house. It sometimes happened
      that the store was quickly exhausted, and the cart, which had arrived
      full, went away empty, whilst many of the dead in the street were still
      unserved. In nearly every dwelling, upstairs and down, from the roof to
      the cellar, there was a stunning tapping of hammers: coffins were being
      nailed down, and so many, so very many were nailed, that sometimes those
      who worked stopped from sheer fatigue. Then broke forth laments,
      heart-rending moans, despairing imprecations. They were uttered by those
      from whom the men in black and gray had taken some one to fill the
      coffins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unceasingly were the coffins filled, and day and night did those men work,
      but by day more than by night, for, as soon as it was dusk, came a gloomy
      file of vehicles of all kinds&mdash;the usual hearses were not sufficient;
      but cars, carts, drays, hackney-coaches, and such like, swelled the
      funeral procession; different to the other conveyances, which entered the
      streets full and went away empty&mdash;these came empty but soon returned
      full. During that period, the windows of many houses were illuminated, and
      often the lights remained burning till the morning. It was &ldquo;the
      season.&rdquo; These illuminations resembled the gleaming rays which shine
      in the gay haunts of pleasure; but there were tapers instead of wax
      candles, and the chanting of prayers for the dead replaced the murmur of
      the ball-room. In the streets, instead of the facetious transparencies
      which indicate the costumers, there swung at intervals huge lanterns of a
      blood-red color, with these words in black letters: &ldquo;Assistance for
      those attacked with the cholera.&rdquo; The true places for revelry,
      during the night, were the churchyards; they ran riot&mdash;they, usually
      so desolate and silent, during the dark, quiet hours, when the cypress
      trees rustle in the breeze, so lonely, that no human step dared to disturb
      the solemn silence which reigned there at night, became on a sudden,
      animated, noisy, riotous, and resplendent with light. By the smoky flames
      of torches, which threw a red glare upon the dark fir-trees, and the white
      tombstones, many grave-diggers worked merrily, humming snatches of some
      favorite tune. Their laborious and hazardous industry then commanded a
      very high price; they were in such request that it was necessary to humor
      them. They drank often and much; they sang long and loud; and this to keep
      up their strength and spirits good, absolute requisites in such an
      employment. If, by chance, any did not finish the grave they had begun,
      some obliging comrade finished it for them (fitting expression!), and
      placed them in it with friendly care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other distant sounds responded to the joyous strains of the grave diggers;
      public-houses had sprung up in the neighborhood of the churchyards, and
      the drivers of the dead, when they had &ldquo;set down their customers,&rdquo;
      as they jocosely expressed themselves, enriched with their unusual
      gratuities, feasted and made merry like lords; dawn often found them with
      a glass in their hands, and a jest on their lips; and, strange to say,
      among these funeral satellites, who breathed the very atmosphere of the
      disease, the mortality was scarcely perceptible. In the dark, squalid
      quarters of the town, where, surrounded by infectious exhalations, the
      indigent population was crowded together, and miserable beings, exhausted
      by severe privation, were &ldquo;bespoke&rdquo; by the cholera, as it was
      energetically said at the time, not only individuals, but whole families,
      were carried off in a few hours; and yet, sometimes, oh, merciful
      Providence! one or two little children were left in the cold and empty
      room, after the father and mother, brother and sister, had been taken away
      in their shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently, houses which had swarmed with hard working laborers, were
      obliged to be shut up for want of tenants; in one day, they had been
      completely cleared by this terrible visitation, from the cellars, where
      little chimney-sweepers slept upon straw, to the garret, on whose cold
      brick floor lay stretched some wan and half-naked being, without work and
      without bread. But, of all the wards of Paris, that which perhaps
      presented the most frightful spectacle during the progress of the cholera,
      was the City; and in the City, the square before the cathedral of
      Notre-Dame was almost every day the theatre of dreadful scenes: for this
      locality was frequently thronged with those who conveyed the sick from the
      neighboring streets to the Great Hospital. The cholera had not one aspect,
      but a thousand. So that one week after Rodin had been suddenly attacked,
      several events combining the horrible and the grotesque occurred in the
      square of Notre Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the Rue d&rsquo;Arcole, which now leads directly to the square,
      it was then approached on one side, by a mean, narrow lane, like all the
      other streets of the City, and terminating in a dark, low archway. Upon
      entering the square the principal door of the huge Cathedral was to the
      left of the spectator, and facing him were the Hospital buildings. A
      little beyond, was an opening which gave to view a portion of the parapet
      of the Quay Notre-Dame. A placard had been recently stuck on the
      discolored and sunken wail of the archway; it contained these words,
      traced in large characters.(37)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;VENGEANCE! VENGEANCE!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Working-men carried to the hospitals are poisoned, because the
      number of patients is too great; every night, Boats filled with corpses,
      drop down the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vengeance and Death to the murderers of the People!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men, enveloped in cloaks, and half-hidden in the deep shadow of the
      vault, were listening with anxious curiosity to the threatening murmur,
      which rose with increasing force from among a tumultuous assembly, grouped
      around the Hospital. Soon, cries of &ldquo;Death to the doctors!&mdash;Vengeance!&rdquo;
      reached the ears of the persons who were in ambush under the arch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The posters are working,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;the train is on
      fire. When once the populace is roused, we can set them on whom we please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; replied the other man, &ldquo;look over there. That
      Hercules, whose athletic form towers above the mob, was cue of the most
      frantic leaders when M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory was destroyed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he was; I know him again. Wherever mischief is to be
      done, you are sure to find those vagabonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, take my advice, do not let us remain under this archway,&rdquo;
      said the other man; &ldquo;the wind is as cold as ice, and though I am
      cased in flannel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, the cholera is confoundedly impolite. Besides,
      everything is going on well here; I am likewise assured that the whole of
      the Faubourg Saint-Antoine is ready to rise in the republican cause; that
      will serve our ends, and our holy religion will triumph over revolutionary
      impiety. Let us rejoin Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we find him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near here, come&mdash;come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two hastily disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun, beginning to decline, shed its golden rays upon the blackened
      sculptures of the porch of Notre-Dame, and upon its two massy towers,
      rising in imposing majesty against a perfectly blue sky, for during the
      fast few days, a north-east wind, dry and cold, had driven away the
      lightest cloud. A considerable number of people, as we have already
      stated, obstructed the approach to the Hospital; they crowded round the
      iron railings that protect the front of the building, behind which was
      stationed a detachment of infantry, the cries of &ldquo;Death to the
      doctors!&rdquo; becoming every moment more threatening. The people who
      thus vociferated. belonged to an idle, vagabond, and depraved populace&mdash;the
      dregs of the Paris mob; and (terrible spectacle!) the unfortunate beings
      who were forcibly carried through the midst of these hideous groups
      entered the Hospital, whilst the air resounded with hoarse clamors, and
      cries of &ldquo;Death.&rdquo; Every moment, fresh victims were brought
      along in litters, and on stretchers; the litters were frequently furnished
      with coarse curtains, and thus the sick occupants were concealed from the
      public gaze; but the stretchers, having no covering, the convulsive
      movements of the dying patients often thrust aside the sheet, and exposed
      to view their faces, livid as corpses. Far from inspiring with terror the
      wretches assembled round the Hospital, such spectacles became to them the
      signal for savage jests, and atrocious predictions upon the fate of these
      poor creatures, when once in the power of the doctors.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The big blaster and Ciboule, with a good many of their adherents, were
      among the mob. After the destruction of Hardy&rsquo;s factory, the
      quarryman was formally expelled from the union of the Wolves, who would
      have nothing more to do with this wretch; since then, he had plunged into
      the grossest debauchery, and speculating on his herculean strength, had
      hired himself as the officious champion of Ciboule and her compeers. With
      the exception therefore of some chance passengers, the square of
      Notre-Dame was filled with a ragged crowd, composed of the refuse of the
      Parisian populace&mdash;wretches who call for pity as well as blame; for
      misery, ignorance, and destitution, beget but too fatally vice and crime.
      These savages of civilization felt neither pity, improvement, nor terror,
      at the shocking sights with which they were surrounded; careless of a life
      which was a daily struggle against hunger, or the allurements of guilt,
      they braved the pestilence with infernal audacity, or sank under it with
      blasphemy on their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall form of the quarryman was conspicuous amongst the rest; with
      inflamed eyes and swollen features, he yelled at the top of his voice:
      &ldquo;Death to the body-snatchers! they poison the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is easier than to feed them,&rdquo; added Ciboule. Then,
      addressing herself to an old man, who was being carried with great
      difficulty through the dense crowd, upon a chair, by two men, the hag
      continued: &ldquo;Hey? don&rsquo;t go in there, old croaker; die here in
      the open air instead of dying in that den, where you&rsquo;ll be doctored
      like an old rat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the quarryman; &ldquo;and then they&rsquo;ll
      throw you into the water to feast the fishes, which you won&rsquo;t
      swallow any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these atrocious cries, the old man looked wildly around, and uttered
      faint groans. Ciboule wished to stop the persons who were carrying him,
      and they had much difficulty in getting rid of the hag. The number of
      cholera-patients arriving increased every moment, and soon neither litters
      nor stretchers could be obtained, so that they were borne along in the
      arms of the attendants. Several awful episodes bore witness to the
      startling rapidity of the infection. Two men were carrying a stretcher
      covered with a blood-stained sheet; one of them suddenly felt himself
      attacked with the complaint; he stopped short, his powerless arms let go
      the stretcher; he turned pale, staggered, fell upon the patient, becoming
      as livid as him; the other man, struck with terror, fled precipitately,
      leaving his companion and the dying man in the midst of the crowd. Some
      drew back in horror, others burst into a savage laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses have taken fright,&rdquo; said the quarryman, &ldquo;and
      have left the turn-out in the lurch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cried the dying man, with a despairing accent; &ldquo;for
      pity&rsquo;s sake take me in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more room in the pit,&rdquo; said one, in a
      jeering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve no legs left to reach the gallery,&rdquo; added
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man made an effort to rise; but his strength failed him; he fell
      back exhausted on the mattress. A sudden movement took place among the
      crowd, the stretcher was overturned, the old man and his companion were
      trodden underfoot, and their groans were drowned in the cries of &ldquo;Death
      to the body-snatchers!&rdquo; The yells were renewed with fresh fury, but
      the ferocious band, who respected nothing in their savage fury, were soon
      after obliged to open their ranks to several workmen, who vigorously
      cleared the way for two of their friends carrying in their arms a poor
      artisan. He was still young, but his heavy and already livid head hung
      down upon the shoulder of one of them. A little child followed, sobbing,
      and holding by one of the workmen&rsquo;s coats. The measured and sonorous
      sound of several drums was now heard at a distance in the winding streets
      of the city: they were beating the call to arms, for sedition was rife in
      the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The drummers emerged from under the archway,
      and were traversing the square, when one of them, a gray-haired veteran,
      suddenly slackened the rolling of his drum, and stood still: his
      companions turned round in surprise&mdash;he had turned green; his legs
      gave way, he stammered some unintelligible words, and had fallen upon the
      pavement before those in the front rank had time to pause. The
      overwhelming rapidity of this attack startled for a moment the most
      hardened among the surrounding spectators; for, wondering at the
      interruption, a part of the crowd had rushed towards the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the dying man, supported in the arms of two of his comrades,
      one of the individuals, who, concealed under the arch, had watched the
      beginning of the popular excitement, said to the drummers: &ldquo;Your
      comrade drank, perhaps, at some fountain on the road?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied one; &ldquo;he was very thirsty; he drank
      two mouthfuls of water on the Place du Chatelet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is poisoned,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisoned?&rdquo; cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not surprising,&rdquo; replied the man, in a mysterious tone;
      &ldquo;poison is thrown into the public fountains; and this very morning a
      man was massacred in the Rue Beaubourg who was discovered emptying a paper
      of arsenic into a pot of wine at a public-house.&rdquo;(38)
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said these words, the man disappeared in the crowd. This report, no
      less absurd than the tales about the poisoning of the Hospital patients,
      was received with a general burst of indignation. Five or six ragged
      beings, regular ruffians, seized the body of the expiring drummer, hoisted
      it upon their shoulders, in spite of all the efforts of his comrades to
      prevent them, and paraded the square exhibiting the dismal trophy. Ciboule
      and the quarryman went before, crying: &ldquo;Wake way for the corpse!
      This is how they poison the people!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh incident now attracted the attention of the crowd. A travelling
      carriage, which had not been able to pass along the Quai-Napoleon, the
      pavement of which was up, had ventured among the intricate streets of the
      city, and now arrived in the square of Notre-Dame on its way to the other
      side of the Seine. Like many others, its owners were flying from Paris, to
      escape the pestilence which decimated it. A man-servant and a lady&rsquo;s
      maid were in the rumble, and they exchanged a glance of alarm as they
      passed the Hospital, whilst a young man seated in the front part of the
      carriage let down the glass, and called to the postilions to go slowly,
      for fear of accident, as the crowd was very dense at that part of the
      square. This young man was Lord Morinval, and on the back seat were Lord
      Montbron and his niece, Lady Morinval. The pale and anxious countenance of
      the young lady showed the alarm which she felt; and Montbron,
      notwithstanding his firmness of mind, appeared to be very uneasy; he, as
      well as his niece, frequently had recourse to a smelling-bottle filled
      with camphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last few minutes, the carriage had advanced very slowly, the
      postilions managing their horses with great caution, when a sudden hubbub,
      at first distant and undefined, but soon more distinct, arose among the
      throng, as it drew near, the ringing sound of chains and metal, peculiar
      to the artillery-wagons, was plainly audible, and presently one of these
      vehicles came towards the travelling-carriage, from the direction of the
      Quai Notre-Dame. It seemed strange, that though the crowd was so compact,
      yet at the rapid approach of this wagon, the close ranks of human beings
      opened as if by enchantment, but the following words which were passed
      from mouth to mouth soon accounted for the prodigy: &ldquo;A wagon full of
      dead! the wagon of the dead!&rdquo; As we have already stated, the usual
      funeral conveyances were no longer sufficient for the removal of the
      corpses; a number of artillery wagons had been put into requisition, and
      the coffins were hastily piled in these novel hearses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the spectators regarded this gloomy vehicle with dismay, but the
      quarryman and his band redoubled their horrible jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make way for the omnibus of the departed!&rdquo; cried Ciboule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No danger of having one&rsquo;s toes crushed in that omnibus,&rdquo;
      said the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless they&rsquo;re easy to please, the stiff-uns in there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never want to be set down, at all events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, there&rsquo;s only one reg&rsquo;lar on duty as postilion!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, the leaders are driven by a man in a
      smock-frock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I daresay the other soldier was tired, lazy fellow! and got
      into the omnibus with the others&mdash;they&rsquo;ll all get out at the
      same big hole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head foremost, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they pitch them head first into a bed of lime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, one might follow the dead-cart blind-fold, and no mistake. It&rsquo;s
      worse than Montfaucon knacker-yards!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather gamey!&rdquo; said the
      quarryman, alluding to the infectious and cadaverous odor which this
      funeral conveyance left behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s sport!&rdquo; exclaimed Ciboule: &ldquo;the omnibus of
      the dead will run against the fine coach. Hurrah! the rich folks will
      smell death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the wagon was now directly in front of the carriage, and at a very
      little distance from it. A man in a smock-frock and wooden shoes drove the
      two leaders, and an artilleryman the other horses. The coffins were so
      piled up within this wagon, that its semicircular top did not shut down
      closely, so that, as it jolted heavily over the uneven pavement, the biers
      could be seen chafing against each other. The fiery eyes and inflamed
      countenance of the man in the smock-frock showed that he was half
      intoxicated; urging on the horses with his voice, his heels, and his whip,
      he paid no attention to the remonstrances of the soldier, who had great
      difficulty in restraining his own animals, and was obliged to follow the
      irregular movements of the carman. Advancing in this disorderly manner,
      the wagon deviated from its course just as it should have passed the
      travelling-carriage, and ran against it. The shock forced open the top,
      one of the coffins was thrown out, and, after damaging the panels of the
      carriage, fell upon the pavement with a dull and heavy sound. The deal
      planks had been hastily nailed together, and were shivered in the fall,
      and from the wreck of the coffin rolled a livid corpse, half enveloped in
      a shroud.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this horrible spectacle, Lady Morinval, who had mechanically leaned
      forward, gave a loud scream, and fainted. The crowd fell back in dismay;
      the postilions, no less alarmed, took advantage of the space left open to
      them by the retreat of the multitude; they whipped their horses, and the
      carriage dashed on towards the quay. As it disappeared behind the
      furthermost buildings of the Hospital, the shrill joyous notes of distant
      trumpets were heard, and repeated shouts proclaimed: &ldquo;The Cholera
      Masquerade!&rdquo; The words announced one of those episodes combining
      buffoonery with terror, which marked the period when the pestilence was on
      the increase, though now they can with difficulty be credited. If the
      evidence of eyewitnesses did not agree in every particular with the
      accounts given in the public papers of this masquerade, they might be
      regarded as the ravings of some diseased brain, and not as the notice of a
      fact which really occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Masquerade of the Cholera&rdquo; appeared, we say, in the
      square of Notre Dame, just as Morinval&rsquo;s carriage gained the quay,
      after disengaging itself from the death-wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      (37) It is well-known that at the time of the cholera, such placards were
      numerous in Paris, and were alternately attributed to opposite parties.
      Among others, to the priests, many of the bishops having published
      mandatory letters, or stated openly in the churches of their diocese, that
      the Almighty had sent the cholera as a punishment to France for having
      driven away its lawful sovereign, and assimilated the Catholic to other
      forms of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      (38) It is notorious, that at this unhappy period several persons were
      massacred, under a false accusation of poisoning the fountains, etc.

      CHAPTER XIX. THE CHOLERA MASQUERADE.(39)
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> stream of people,
      who preceded the masquerade, made a sudden irruption through the arch into
      the square, uttering loud cheers as they advanced. Children were also
      there, blowing horns, whilst some hooted and others hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarryman, Ciboule, and their band, attracted by this new spectacle,
      rushed tumultuously towards the arch. Instead of the two eating-houses,
      which now (1845) stand on either side of the Rue d&rsquo;Arcole, there was
      then only one, situated to the left of the vaulted passage, and much
      celebrated amongst the joyous community of students, for the excellence
      both of its cookery and its wines. At the first blare of the trumpets,
      sounded by the outriders in livery who preceded the masquerade, the
      windows of the great room of the eating-house were thrown open, and
      several waiters, with their napkins under their arms, leaned forward,
      impatient to witness the arrival of the singular guests they were
      expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, the grotesque procession made its appearance in the thick of an
      immense uproar. The train comprised a chariot, escorted by men and women
      on horseback, clad in rich and elegant fancy dresses. Most of these
      maskers belonged to the middle and easy classes of society. The report had
      spread that masquerade was in preparation, for the purpose of daring the
      cholera, and, by this joyous demonstration, to revive the courage of the
      affrighted populace. Immediately, artists, young men about town, students,
      and so on, responded to the appeal, and though till now unknown one to the
      other, they easily fraternized together. Many brought their mistresses, to
      complete the show. A subscription had been opened to defray the expenses,
      and, that morning, after a splendid breakfast at the other end of Paris,
      the joyous troop had started bravely on their march, to finish the day by
      a dinner in the square of Notre Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say bravely, for it required a singular turn of mind, a rare firmness
      of character, in young women, to traverse, in this fashion, a great city
      plunged in consternation and terror&mdash;to fall in at every step with
      litters loaded with the dying, and carriages filled with the dead&mdash;to
      defy, as it were, in a spirit of strange pleasantry, the plague that was
      detonating the Parisians. It is certain that, in Paris alone, and there
      only amongst a peculiar class, could such an idea have ever been conceived
      or realized. Two men, grotesquely disguised as postilions at a funeral,
      with formidable false noses, rose-colored crape hat-bands and large favors
      of roses and crape bows at their buttonholes, rode before the vehicle.
      Upon the platform of the car were groups of allegorical personages,
      representing WINE, PLEASURE, LOVE, PLAY. The mission of these symbolical
      beings was, by means of jokes, sarcasms, and mockeries, to plague the life
      out of Goodman Cholera, a sort of funeral and burlesque Cassander, whom
      they ridiculed and made game of in a hundred ways. The moral of the play
      was this: &ldquo;To brave Cholera in security, let us drink, laugh, game,
      and make love!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      WINE was represented by a huge, lusty Silenus, thick-set, and with swollen
      paunch, a crown of ivy on his brow, a panther&rsquo;s skin across his
      shoulder, and in his hand a large gilt goblet, wreathed with flowers. None
      other than Ninny Moulin, the famous moral and religious writer, could have
      exhibited to the astonished and delighted spectators an ear of so deep a
      scarlet, so majestic an abdomen, and a face of such triumphant and
      majestic fulness. Every moment, Ninny Moulin appeared to empty his cup&mdash;after
      which he burst out laughing in the face of Goodman Cholera. Goodman
      Cholera, a cadaverous pantaloon, was half-enveloped in a shroud; his mask
      of greenish cardboard, with red, hollow eyes, seemed every moment to grin
      as in mockery of death; from beneath his powdered peruke, surmounted by a
      pyramidical cotton night-cap, appeared his neck and arm, dyed of a bright
      green color; his lean hand, which shook almost always with a feverish
      trembling (not feigned, but natural), rested upon a crutch-handled cane;
      finally, as was becoming in a pantaloon, he wore red stockings, with
      buckles at the knees, and high slippers of black beaver. This grotesque
      representative of the cholera was Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding a slow and dangerous fever, caused by the excessive use of
      brandy, and by constant debauchery, that was silently undermining his
      constitution, Jacques Rennepont had been induced by Morok to join the
      masquerade. The brute-tamer himself, dressed as the King of Diamonds,
      represented PLAY. His forehead was adorned with a diadem of gilded paper,
      his face was pale and impassible, and as his long, yellow beard fell down
      the front of his parti-colored robe, Morok looked exactly the character he
      personated. From time to time, with an air of grave mockery, he shook
      close to the eyes of Goodman Cholera a large bag full of sounding
      counters, and on this bag were painted all sorts of playing cards. A
      certain stiffness in the right arm showed that the lion-tamer had not yet
      quite recovered from the effects of the wound which the panther had
      inflicted before being stabbed by Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLEASURE, who also represented Laughter, classically shook her rattle,
      with its sonorous gilded bells, close to the ears of Goodman Cholera. She
      was a quick, lively young girl, and her fine black hair was crowned with a
      scarlet cap of liberty. For Sleepinbuff&rsquo;s sake, she had taken the
      place of the poor Bacchanal queen, who would not have failed to attend on
      such an occasion&mdash;she, who had been so valiant and gay, when she bore
      her part in a less philosophical, but not less amusing masquerade. Another
      pretty creature, Modeste Bornichoux, who served as a model to a painter of
      renown (one of the cavaliers of the procession), was eminently successful
      in her representation of LOVE. He could not have had a more charming face,
      and more graceful form. Clad in a light blue spangled tunic, with a blue
      and silver band across her chestnut hair, and little transparent wings
      affixed to her white shoulders, she placed one forefinger upon the other,
      and pointed with the prettiest impertinence at Goodman Cholera. Around the
      principal group, other maskers, more or less grotesque in appearance,
      waved each a banner, an which were inscriptions of a very anacreontic
      character, considering the circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with the Cholera!&rdquo; &ldquo;Short and sweet!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Laugh away, laugh always!&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll collar the
      Cholera!&rdquo; &ldquo;Love forever!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wine forever!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Come if you dare, old terror!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was really such audacious gayety in this masquerade, that the
      greater number of the spectators, at the moment when it crossed the
      square, in the direction of the eating-house, where dinner was waiting,
      applauded it loudly and repeatedly. This sort of admiration, which
      courage, however mad and blind, almost always inspires, appeared to others
      (a small number, it must be confessed) a kind of defiance to the wrath of
      heaven; and these received the procession with angry murmurs. This
      extraordinary spectacle, and the different impressions it produced, were
      too remote from all customary facts to admit of a just appreciation. We
      hardly know if this daring bravado was deserving of praise or blame.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Besides, the appearance of those plagues, which from age to age decimate
      the population of whole countries, has almost always been accompanied by a
      sort of mental excitement, which none of those who have been spared by the
      contagion can hope to escape. It is a strange fever of the mind, which
      sometimes rouses the most stupid prejudices and the most ferocious
      passions, and sometimes inspires, on the contrary, the most magnificent
      devotion, the most courageous actions&mdash;with some, driving the fear of
      death to a point of the wildest terror&mdash;with others, exciting the
      contempt of life to express itself in the most audacious bravadoes. Caring
      little for the praise or blame it might deserve, the masquerade arrived
      before the eating-house, and made its entry in the midst of universal
      acclamations. Everything seemed to combine to give full effect to this
      strange scene, by the opposition of the most singular contrasts. Thus the
      tavern, in which was to be held this extraordinary feast, being situated
      at no great distance from the antique cathedral, and the gloomy hospital,
      the religious anthems of the ancient temple, the cries of the dying, and
      the bacchanalian songs of the banqueteers, must needs mingle, and by turns
      drown one another. The maskers now got down from their chariot, and from
      their horses, and went to take their places at the repast, which was
      waiting for them. The actors in the masquerade are at table in the great
      room of the tavern. They are joyous, noisy, even riotous. Yet their gayety
      has a strange tone, peculiar to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the most resolute involuntarily remember that their life is at
      stake in this mad and audacious game with destiny. That fatal thought is
      rapid as the icy fever-shudder, which chills you in an instant; therefore,
      from time to time, an abrupt silence, lasting indeed only for a second,
      betrays these passing emotions which are almost immediately effaced by new
      bursts of joyful acclamation, for each one says to himself: &ldquo;No
      weakness! my chum and my girl are looking at me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all laugh, and knock glasses together, and challenge the next man, and
      drink out of the glass of the nearest woman. Jacques had taken off the
      mask and peruke of Goodman Cholera. His thin, leaden features, his deadly
      paleness, the lurid brilliancy of his hollow eyes, showed the incessant
      progress of the slow malady which was consuming this unfortunate man,
      brought by excesses to the last extremity of weakness. Though he felt the
      slow fire devouring his entrails, he concealed his pain beneath a forced
      and nervous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left of Jacques was Morok, whose fatal influence was ever on the
      increase, and to his right the girl disguised as PLEASURE. She was named
      Mariette. By her side sat Ninny Moulin, in all his majestic bulk, who
      often pretended to be looking for his napkin under the table, in order to
      have the opportunity of pressing the knees of his other neighbor, Modeste,
      the representative of LOVE. Most of the guests were grouped according to
      their several tastes, each tender pair together, and the bachelors where
      they could. They had reached the second course, and the excellence of the
      wine, the good cheer, the gay speeches, and even the singularity of the
      occasion, had raised their spirits to a high degree of excitement, as may
      be gathered from the extraordinary incidents of the following scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      (39) We read in the Constitutionnel, Saturday March 31st, 1832: &ldquo;The
      Parisians readily conform to that part of the official instructions with
      regard to the cholera, which prescribes, as a preservation from the
      disease, not to be afraid, to amuse one&rsquo;s self, etc. The pleasures
      of Mid-Lent have been as brilliant and as mad as those of the carnival
      itself. For a long time past there had not been so many balls at this
      period of the year. Even the cholera has been made the subject of an
      itinerant caricature.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX. THE DEFIANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo or three times,
      without being remarked by the guests, one of the waiters had come to
      whisper to his fellows, and point with expressive gesture to the ceiling.
      But his comrades had taken small account of his observations or fears, not
      wishing, doubtless, to disturb the guests, whose mad gayety seemed ever on
      the increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can doubt now of the superiority of our manner of treating this
      impertinent Cholera? Has he dared even to touch our sacred battalion?&rdquo;
      said a magnificent mountebank-Turk, one of the standard-bearers of the
      masquerade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is all the mystery,&rdquo; answered another. &ldquo;It is very
      simple. Only laugh in the face of the plague, and it will run away from
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right enough too, for very stupid work it does,&rdquo; added a
      pretty little Columbine, emptying her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my darling; it is intolerably stupid work,&rdquo;
      answered the Clown belonging to the Columbine; &ldquo;here you are very
      quiet, enjoying life, and all on a sudden you die with an atrocious
      grimace. Well! what then? Clever, isn&rsquo;t it? I ask you, what does it
      prove?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It proves,&rdquo; replied an illustrious painter of the romantic
      school, disguised like a Roman out of one of David&rsquo;s pictures,
      &ldquo;it proves that the Cholera is a wretched colorist, for he has
      nothing but a dirty green on his pallet. Evidently he is a pupil of
      Jacobus, that king of classical painters, who are another species of
      plagues.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, master,&rdquo; added respectfully a pupil of the great
      painter, &ldquo;I have seen some cholera patients whose convulsions were
      rather fine, and their dying looks first-rate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried a sculptor of no less celebrity, &ldquo;the
      question lies in a nutshell. The Cholera is a detestable colorist, but a
      good draughtsman. He shows you the skeleton in no time. By heaven! how he
      strips off the flesh!&mdash;Michael Angelo would be nothing to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; cried they all, with one voice; &ldquo;the Cholera is
      a bad colorist, but a good draughtsman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover, gentlemen,&rdquo; added Ninny Moulin, with comic gravity,
      &ldquo;this plague brings with it a providential lesson, as the great
      Bossuet would have said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lesson! the lesson!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, gentlemen; I seem to hear a voice from above, proclaiming:
      &lsquo;Drink of the best, empty your purse, and kiss your neighbor&rsquo;s
      wife; for your hours are perhaps numbered, unhappy wretch!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the orthodox Silenus took advantage of a momentary absence of
      mind on the part of Modeste, his neighbor, to imprint on the blooming
      cheek of LOVE a long, loud kiss. The example was contagious, and a storm
      of kisses was mingled with bursts of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! blood and thunder!&rdquo; cried the great painter as he gayly
      threatened Ninny Moulin; &ldquo;you are very lucky that to-morrow will
      perhaps be the end of the world, or else I should pick a quarrel with you
      for having kissed my lovely LOVE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which proves to you, O Rubens! O Raphael! the thousand advantages
      of the Cholera, whom I declare to be essentially sociable and caressing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And philanthropic,&rdquo; said one of the guests; &ldquo;thanks to
      him, creditors take care of the health of their debtors. This morning a
      usurer, who feels a particular interest in my existence, brought me all
      sorts of anti-choleraic drugs, and begged me to make use of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I!&rdquo; said the pupil of the great painter. &ldquo;My tailor
      wished to force me to wear a flannel band next to the skin, because I owe
      him a thousand crowns. But I answered &lsquo;Oh, tailor, give me a receipt
      in full, and I will wrap myself up in flannel, to preserve you my custom!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Cholera, I drink to thee!&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, by way of
      grotesque invocation. &ldquo;You are not Despair; on the contrary, you are
      the emblem of Hope&mdash;yes, of hope. How many husbands, how many wives,
      longed for a number (alas! too uncertain chance) in the lottery of
      widowhood! You appear, and their hearts are gladdened. Thanks to you,
      benevolent pest! their chances of liberty are increased a hundredfold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how grateful heirs ought to be! A cold&mdash;a heat&mdash;a
      trifle&mdash;and there, in an hour, some old uncle becomes a revered
      benefactor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those who are always looking out for other people&rsquo;s
      places&mdash;what an ally they must find in the Cholera!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how true it will make many vows of constancy!&rdquo; said
      Modeste, sentimentally. &ldquo;How many villains have sworn to a poor,
      weak woman, to love her all their lives, who never meant (the wretches!)
      to keep their word so well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Ninny Moulin, &ldquo;since we are now,
      perhaps, at the eve of the end of the world, as yonder celebrated painter
      has expressed it, I propose to play the world topsy-turvy: I beg these
      ladies to make advances to us, to tease us, to excite us, to steal kisses
      from us, to take all sorts of liberties with us, and (we shall not die of
      it) even to insult us. Yes, I declare that I will allow myself to be
      insulted. So, LOVE, you may offer me the greatest insult that can be
      offered to a virtuous and modest bachelor,&rdquo; added the religious
      writer, leaning over towards his neighbor, who repulsed him with peals of
      laughter; and the proposal of Ninny Moulin being received with general
      hilarity, a new impulse was given to the mirth and riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the uproar, the waiter, who had before entered the room
      several times, to whisper uneasily to his comrades, whilst he pointed to
      the ceiling, again appeared with a pale and agitated countenance;
      approaching the man who performed the office of butler, he said to him, in
      a low voice, tremulous with emotion: &ldquo;They are come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know&mdash;up there&rdquo;; and he pointed to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the butler, becoming thoughtful; &ldquo;where are
      they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have just gone upstairs; they are there now,&rdquo; answered
      the waiter, shaking his head with an air of alarm; &ldquo;yes, they are
      there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does master say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very vexed, because&mdash;&rdquo; and the waiter glanced
      round at the guests. &ldquo;He does not know what to do; he has sent me to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil have I to do with it?&rdquo; said the other; wiping
      his forehead. &ldquo;It was to be expected, and cannot be helped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not remain here till they begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well go, for your long face already attracts attention.
      Tell master we must wait for the upshot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The above incident was scarcely perceived in the midst of the growing
      tumult of the joyous feast. But, among the guests, one alone laughed not,
      drank not. This was Jacques. With fixed and lurid eye, he gazed upon
      vacancy. A stranger to what was passing around him, the unhappy man
      thought of the Bacchanal Queen, who had been so gay and brilliant in the
      midst of similar saturnalia. The remembrance of that one being, whom he
      still loved with an extravagant love, was the only thought that from time
      to time roused him from his besotted state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange, but Jacques had only consented to join this masquerade
      because the mad scene reminded him of the merry day he had spent with
      Cephyse&mdash;that famous breakfast, after a night of dancing, in which
      the Bacchanal Queen, from some extraordinary presentiment, had proposed a
      lugubrious toast with regard to this very pestilence, which was then
      reported to be approaching France. &ldquo;To the Cholera!&rdquo; had she
      said. &ldquo;Let him spare those who wish to live, and kill at the same
      moment those who dread to part!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, at this time, remembering those mournful words, Jacques was
      absorbed in painful thought. Morok perceived his absence of mind, and said
      aloud to him, &ldquo;You have given over drinking, Jacques. Have you had
      enough wine? Then you will want brandy. I will send for some.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want neither wine nor brandy,&rdquo; answered Jacques, abruptly,
      and he fell back into a sombre reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may be right,&rdquo; resumed Morok, in a sardonic tone,
      and raising his voice still higher. &ldquo;You do well to take care of
      yourself. I was wrong to name brandy in these times. There would be as
      much temerity in facing a bottle of brandy as the barrel of a loaded
      pistol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing his courage as a toper called in question, Sleepinbuff looked
      angrily at Morok. &ldquo;You think it is from cowardice that I will not
      drink brandy!&rdquo; cried the unfortunate man, whose half-extinguished
      intellect was roused to defend what he called his dignity. &ldquo;Is it
      from cowardice that I refuse, d&rsquo;ye think, Morok? Answer me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my good fellow, we have all shown our pluck today,&rdquo;
      said one of the guests to Jacques; &ldquo;you, above all, who, being
      rather indisposed, yet had the courage to take the part of Goodman
      Cholera.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; resumed Morok, seeing the general attention fixed
      upon himself and Sleepinbuff, &ldquo;I was only joking; for if my comrade
      (pointing to Jacques) had the imprudence to accept my offer, it would be
      an act, not of courage, but of foolhardiness. Luckily, he has sense enough
      to renounce a piece of boasting so dangerous at this time, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; cried Jacques, interrupting Morok with angry
      impatience, &ldquo;two bottles of brandy, and two glasses!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; said Morok, with pretended
      uneasiness. &ldquo;Why do you order two bottles of brandy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a duel,&rdquo; said Jacques, in a cool, resolute tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A duel!&rdquo; cried the spectators, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Jacques, &ldquo;a duel with brandy. You pretend
      there is as much danger in facing a bottle of brandy as a loaded pistol;
      let us each take a full bottle, and see who will be the first to cry
      quarter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This strange proposition was received by some with shouts of joy, and by
      others with genuine uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! the champions of the bottle!&rdquo; cried the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; there would be too much danger in such a contest,&rdquo;
      said the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; added one of the guests; &ldquo;this challenge is
      as serious as an invitation to fight to the death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; said Morok, with a diabolical smile, &ldquo;you
      hear, Jacques? Will you now retreat before the danger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, which reminded him of the peril to which he was about to
      expose himself, Jacques started, as if a sudden idea had occurred to him.
      He raised his head proudly, his cheeks were slightly flushed, his eye
      shone with a kind of gloomy satisfaction, and he exclaimed in a firm
      voice: &ldquo;Hang it, waiter! are you deaf? I asked you for two bottles
      of brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter, going to fetch them, although
      himself frightened at what might be the result of this bacchanalian
      struggle. But the mad and perilous resolution of Jacques was applauded by
      the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ninny Moulin moved about on his chair, stamped his feet, and shouted with
      all his might: &ldquo;Bacchus and drink! bottles and glasses! the throats
      are dry! brandy to the rescue! Largess! largess!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, like a true champion of the tournament, he embraced Modeste, adding,
      to excuse the liberty: &ldquo;Love, you shall be the Queen of Beauty, and
      I am only anticipating the victor&rsquo;s happiness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy to the rescue!&rdquo; repeated they all, in chorus. &ldquo;Largess!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; added Ninny Moulin, with enthusiasm, &ldquo;shall
      we remain indifferent to the noble example set us by Goodman Cholera? He
      said in his pride, &lsquo;brandy!&rsquo; Let us gloriously answer, &lsquo;punch!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! punch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punch to the rescue!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; shouted the religious writer, with the voice of a
      Stentor, &ldquo;waiter! have you a pan, a caldron, a hogshead, or any
      other immensity, in which we can brew a monster punch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Babylonian punch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lake of punch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ocean of punch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the ambitious crescendo that followed the proposition of Ninny
      Moulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the waiter, with an air of triumph, &ldquo;we
      just happen to have a large copper caldron, quite new. It has been used,
      and would hold at least thirty bottles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring the caldron!&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin, majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The caldron forever!&rdquo; shouted the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put in twenty bottles of brandy, six loaves of sugar, a dozen
      lemons, a pound of cinnamon, and then&mdash;fire! fire!&rdquo; shouted the
      religious writer, with the most vociferous exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! fire!&rdquo; repeated the chorus!
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition of Ninny Moulin gave a new impetus to the general gayety;
      the most extravagant remarks were mingled with the sound of kisses, taken
      or given under the pretext that perhaps there would be no to-morrow, that
      one must make the most of the present, etc., etc. Suddenly, in one of the
      moments of silence which sometimes occur in the midst of the greatest
      tumult, a succession of slow and measured taps sounded above the ceiling
      of the banqueting-room. All remained silent, and listened.

      CHAPTER XXI. BRANDY TO THE RESCUE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the lapse of
      some seconds, the singular rapping which had so much surprised the guests,
      was again heard, but this time louder and longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; cried one of the party, &ldquo;what in the devil&rsquo;s
      name is knocking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter, exchanging with his comrades a look of uneasiness and alarm,
      stammered Out in reply: &ldquo;Sir&mdash;it is&mdash;it is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I suppose it is some crabbed, cross-grained lodger, some
      animal, the enemy of joy, who is pounding on the floor of his room to warn
      us to sing less loud,&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by a general rule,&rdquo; answered sententiously the pupil of
      the great painter, &ldquo;if lodger or landlord ask for silence, tradition
      bids us reply by an infernal uproar, destined to drown all his
      remonstrances. Such, at least,&rdquo; added the scapegrace, modestly,
      &ldquo;are the foreign relations that I have always seen observed between
      neighboring powers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark was received with general laughter and applause. During the
      tumult, Morok questioned one of the waiters, and then exclaimed in a
      shrill tone, which rose above the clamor: &ldquo;I demand a hearing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted!&rdquo; cried the others, gayly. During the silence which
      followed the exclamation of Morok, the noise was again heard; it was this
      time quicker than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lodger is innocent,&rdquo; said Morok, with a strange smile,
      &ldquo;and would be quite incapable of interfering with your enjoyment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why does he keep up that knocking?&rdquo; said Ninny Moulin,
      emptying his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a deaf man who has lost his ear-horn?&rdquo; added the young
      artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the lodger who is knocking&rdquo; said Morok, in a sharp,
      quick tone; &ldquo;for they are nailing him down in his coffin.&rdquo; A
      sudden and mournful silence followed these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His coffin no, I am wrong,&rdquo; resumed Morok; &ldquo;her coffin,
      I should say, or more properly their coffin; for, in these pressing times,
      they put mother and child together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; cried PLEASURE, addressing the writer; &ldquo;is it
      a woman that is dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; a poor young woman about twenty years of age,&rdquo;
      answered the waiter in a sorrowful tone. &ldquo;Her little girl, that she
      was nursing, died soon after&mdash;all in less than two hours. My master
      is very sorry that you ladies and gents should be disturbed in this way;
      but he could not foresee this misfortune, as yesterday morning the young
      woman was quite well, and singing with all her might&mdash;no one could
      have been gayer than she was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon these words, it was as if a funeral pall had been suddenly thrown
      over a scene lately so full of joy; all the rubicund and jovial faces took
      an expression of sadness; no one had the hardihood to make a jest of
      mother and child, nailed down together in the same coffin. The silence
      became so profound, that one could hear each breath oppressed by terror:
      the last blows of the hammer seemed to strike painfully on every heart; it
      appeared as if each sad feeling, until now repressed, was about to replace
      that animation and gayety, which had been more factitious than sincere.
      The moment was decisive. It was necessary to strike an immediate blow, and
      to raise the spirits of the guests, for many pretty rosy faces began to
      grow pale, many scarlet ears became suddenly white; Ninny Moulin&rsquo;s
      were of the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, Sleepinbuff exhibited an increase of audacity; he drew up
      his figure, bent down from the effects of exhaustion, and, with a cheek
      slightly flushed, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, waiter? are those bottles of
      brandy coming? And the punch? Devil and all! are the dead to frighten the
      living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right! Down with sorrow, and let&rsquo;s have the punch!&rdquo;
      cried several of the guests, who felt the necessity of reviving their
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward, punch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone, dull care!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jollity forever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, here is the punch,&rdquo; said a waiter, opening the
      door. At sight of the flaming beverage, which was to reanimate their
      enfeebled spirits, the room rang with the loudest applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had just set. The room was large, being capable of dining a
      hundred guests; and the windows were few, narrow, and half veiled by red
      cotton curtains. Though it was not yet night, some portions of this vast
      saloon were almost entirely dark. Two waiters brought the monster-punch,
      in an immense brass kettle, brilliant as gold, suspended from an iron bar,
      and crowned with flames of changing color. The burning beverage was then
      placed upon the table, to the great joy of the guests, who began to forget
      their past alarms.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30071.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jacques to Morok, in a taunting tone, &ldquo;while
      the punch is burning, we will have our duel. The company shall judge.&rdquo;
      Then, pointing to the two bottles of brandy, which the waiter had brought,
      Jacques added: &ldquo;Choose your weapon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you choose,&rdquo; answered Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! here&rsquo;s your bottle&mdash;and here&rsquo;s your glass.
      Ninny Moulin shall be umpire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not refuse to be judge of the field,&rdquo; answered the
      religious writer, &ldquo;only I must warn you, comrade, that you are
      playing a desperate game, and that just now, as one of these gentlemen has
      said, the neck of a bottle of brandy in one&rsquo;s mouth, is perhaps more
      dangerous than the barrel of a loaded pistol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the word, old fellow!&rdquo; said Jacques, interrupting Ninny
      Moulin, &ldquo;or I will give it myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you will have it so&mdash;so be it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first who gives in is conquered,&rdquo; said Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; answered Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, gentlemen, attention! we must follow every movement,&rdquo;
      resumed Ninny Moulin. &ldquo;Let us first see if the bottles are of the
      same size&mdash;equality of weapons being the foremost condition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During these preparations, profound silence reigned in the room. The
      courage of the majority of those present, animated for a moment by the
      arrival of the punch, was soon again depressed by gloomy thoughts, as they
      vaguely foresaw the danger of the contest between Morok and Jacques. This
      impression joined to the sad thoughts occasioned by the incident of the
      coffin, darkened by degrees many a countenance. Some of the guests,
      indeed, continued to make a show of rejoicing, but their gayety appeared
      forced. Under certain circumstances, the smallest things will have the
      most powerful effect. We have said that, after sunset, a portion of this
      large room was plunged in obscurity; therefore, the guests who sat in the
      remote corners of the apartment, had no other light than the reflection of
      the flaming punch. Now it is well known, that the flame of burning spirit
      throws a livid, bluish tint over the countenance; it was therefore a
      strange, almost frightful spectacle, to see a number of the guests, who
      happened to be at a distance from the windows, in this ghastly and
      fantastic light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter, more struck than all the rest by this effect of color,
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Look! at this end of the table, we might fancy ourselves
      feasting with cholera-patients, we are such fine blues and greens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This jest was not much relished. Fortunately, the loud voice of Ninny
      Moulin demanded attention, and for a moment turned the thoughts of the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lists are open,&rdquo; cried the religious writer, really more
      frightened than he chose to appear. &ldquo;Are you ready, brave champions?&rdquo;
      he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are ready,&rdquo; said Morok and Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present! fire!&rdquo; cried Ninny Moulin, clapping his hands. And
      the two drinkers each emptied a tumbler full of brandy at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok did not even knit his brow; his marble face remained impassible;
      with a steady hand he replaced his glass upon the table. But Jacques, as
      he put down his glass, could not conceal a slight convulsive trembling,
      caused by internal suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravely done!&rdquo; cried Ninny Moulin. &ldquo;The quarter of a
      bottle of brandy at a draught&mdash;it is glorious! No one else here would
      be capable of such prowess. And now, worthy champions, if you believe me,
      you will stop where you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the word!&rdquo; answered Jacques, intrepidly. And, with
      feverish and shaking hand, he seized the bottle; then suddenly, instead of
      filling his glass, he said to Morok: &ldquo;Bah! we want no glasses. It is
      braver to drink from the bottle. I dare you to it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Morok&rsquo;s only answer was to shrug his shoulders, and raise the neck
      of the bottle to his lips. Jacques hastened to imitate him. The thin,
      yellowish, transparent glass gave a perfect view of the progressive
      diminution of the liquor. The stony countenance of Morok, and the pale
      thin face of Jacques, on which already stood large drops of cold sweat,
      were now, as well as the features of the other guests, illuminated by the
      bluish light of the punch; every eye was fixed upon Morok and Jacques,
      with that barbarous curiosity which cruel spectacles seem involuntarily to
      inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques continued to drink, holding the bottle in his left hand; suddenly,
      he closed and tightened the fingers of his right hand with a convulsive
      movement; his hair clung to his icy forehead, and his countenance revealed
      an agony of pain. Yet he continued to drink; only, without removing his
      lips from the neck of the bottle, he lowered it for an instant, as if to
      recover breath. Just then, Jacques met the sardonic look of Morok, who
      continued to drink with his accustomed impassibility. Thinking that he saw
      the expression of insulting triumph in Morok&rsquo;s glance, Jacques
      raised his elbow abruptly, and drank with avidity a few drops more. But
      his strength was exhausted. A quenchless fire devoured his vitals. His
      sufferings were too intense, and he could no longer bear up against them.
      His head fell backwards, his jaws closed convulsively, he crushed the neck
      of the bottle between his teeth, his neck grew rigid, his limbs writhed
      with spasmodic action, and he became almost senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques, my good fellow! it is nothing,&rdquo; cried Morok, whose
      ferocious glance now sparkled with diabolical joy. Then, replacing his
      bottle on the table, he rose to go to the aid of Ninny Moulin, who was
      vainly endeavoring to hold Sleepinbuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden attack had none of the symptoms of cholera. Yet terror seized
      upon all present; one of the women was taken with hysterics, and another
      uttered piercing cries and fainted away. Ninny Moulin, leaving Jacques in
      the hands of Morok, ran towards the door to seek for help,&mdash;when that
      door was suddenly opened, and the religious writer drew back in alarm, at
      the sight of the unexpected personage who appeared on the threshold.

      CHAPTER XXII. MEMORIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he person before
      whom Ninny Moulin stopped in such extreme astonishment was the Bacchanal
      Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale and wan, with, hair in disorder, hollow cheeks, sunken eyes, and
      clothed almost in rags, this brilliant and joyous heroine of so many mad
      orgies was now only the shadow of her former self. Misery and grief were
      impressed on that countenance, once so charming. Hardly had she entered
      the room, when Cephyse paused; her mournful and unquiet gaze strove to
      penetrate the half-obscurity of the apartment, in search of him she longed
      to see. Suddenly the girl started, and uttered a loud scream. She had just
      perceived, at the other side of a long table, by the bluish light of the
      punch, Jacques struggling with Morok and one of the guests, who were
      hardly able to restrain his convulsive movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sight Cephyse, in her first alarm, carried away by her affection,
      did what she had so often done in the intoxication of joy and pleasure.
      Light and agile, instead of losing precious time in making a long circuit,
      she sprang at once upon the table, passed nimbly through the array of
      plates and bottles, and with one spring was by the side of the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques!&rdquo; she exclaimed, without yet remarking the
      lion-tamer, and throwing herself on the neck of her lover. &ldquo;Jacques!
      it is I&mdash;Cephyse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That well-known voice, that heart-piercing cry, which came from the bottom
      of the soul, seemed not unheard by Sleepinbuff. He turned his head
      mechanically towards the Bacchanal Queen, without opening his eyes, and
      heaved a deep sigh; his stiffened limbs relaxed, a slight trembling
      succeeded to the convulsions, and in a few seconds his heavy eyelids were
      raised with an effort, so as to uncover his dull and wandering gaze. Mute
      with astonishment, the spectators of this scene felt an uneasy curiosity.
      Cephyse, kneeling beside her lover, bathed his hands in her tears, covered
      them with kisses, and exclaimed, in a voice broken by sobs, &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Cephyse&mdash;I
      have found you again&mdash;it was not my fault that I abandoned you!
      Forgive me, forgive&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched woman!&rdquo; cried Morok, irritated at this meeting,
      which might, perhaps, be fatal to his projects; &ldquo;do you wish to kill
      him? In his present state, this agitation is death. Begone!&rdquo; So
      saying, he seized Cephyse suddenly by the arm, just as Jacques, waking, as
      it were, from a painful dream, began to distinguish what was passing
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! It is you!&rdquo; cried the Bacchanal Queen, in amazement, as
      she recognized Morok, &ldquo;who separated me from Jacques!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused; for the dim eye of the victim, as it rested upon her, grew
      suddenly bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cephyse!&rdquo; murmured Jacques; &ldquo;is it you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is I,&rdquo; answered she, in a voice of deep emotion;
      &ldquo;who have come&mdash;I will tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was unable to continue, and, as she clasped her hands together, her
      pale, agitated, tearful countenance expressed her astonishment and despair
      at the mortal change which had taken place in the features of Jacques. He
      understood the cause of her surprise, and as he contemplated, in his turn,
      the suffering and emaciated countenance of Cephyse, he said to her,
      &ldquo;Poor girl! you also have had to bear much grief, much misery&mdash;I
      should hardly have known you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cephyse, &ldquo;much grief&mdash;much misery&mdash;and
      worse than misery,&rdquo; she added, trembling, whilst a deep blush
      overspread her pale features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than misery?&rdquo; said Jacques, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is you who have suffered,&rdquo; hastily resumed Cephyse,
      without answering her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now, I was going to make an end of it&mdash;your voice has
      recalled me for an instant&mdash;but I feel something here,&rdquo; and he
      laid his hand upon his breast, &ldquo;which never gives quarter. It is all
      the same now&mdash;I have seen you&mdash;I shall die happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not die, Jacques; I am here&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to one, my girl. If I had a bushel of live coal in my
      stomach, it could hardly burn me more. For more than a month, I have been
      consuming my body by a slow fire. This gentleman,&rdquo; he added,
      glancing at Morok, &ldquo;this dear friend, always undertook to feed the
      flame. I do not regret life; I have lost the habit of work, and taken to
      drink and riot; I should have finished by becoming a thorough blackguard:
      I preferred that my friend here should amuse himself with lighting a
      furnace in my inside. Since what I drank just now, I am certain that it
      fumes like yonder punch.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both foolish and ungrateful,&rdquo; said Morok, shrugging
      his shoulders; &ldquo;you held out your glass, and I filled it&mdash;and,
      faith, we shall drink long and often together yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments, Cephyse had not withdrawn her eyes from Morok. &ldquo;I
      tell you, that you have long blown the fire, in which I have burnt my
      skin,&rdquo; resumed Jacques, addressing Morok in a feeble voice, &ldquo;so
      that they may not think I die of cholera. It would look as if I had been
      frightened by the part I played. I do not therefore reproach you, my
      affectionate friend,&rdquo; added he, with a sardonic smile; &ldquo;you
      dug my grave gayly&mdash;and sometimes, when, seeing the great dark hole,
      into which I was about to fall, I drew back a step&mdash;but you, my
      excellent friend, still pushed me forward, saying, &lsquo;Go on, my boy,
      go on!&rsquo;&mdash;and I went on&mdash;and here I am&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Sleepinbuff burst into a bitter laugh, which sent an icy
      shudder through the spectators of this scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good fellow,&rdquo; said Morok, coolly, &ldquo;listen to me, and
      follow my advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! I know your advice&mdash;and, instead of listening to
      you, I prefer speaking to my poor Cephyse. Before I go down to the moles,
      I should like to tell her what weighs on my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacques,&rdquo; replied Cephyse, &ldquo;do not talk so. I tell you,
      you shall not die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, my brave Cephyse, I shall owe my life to you,&rdquo;
      returned Jacques, in a tone of serious feeling, which surprised the
      spectators. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed he, &ldquo;when I came to myself,
      and saw you so poorly clad, I felt something good about my heart&mdash;do
      you know why?&mdash;it was because I said to myself, &lsquo;Poor girl! she
      has kept her word bravely; she has chosen to toil, and want, and suffer&mdash;rather
      than take another love&mdash;who would have given her what I gave her as
      long as I could&rsquo;&mdash;and that thought, Cephyse, refreshed my soul.
      I needed it, for I was burning&mdash;and I burn still,&rdquo; added he,
      clinching his fists with pain; &ldquo;but that made me happy&mdash;it did
      me good&mdash;thanks, my good, brave Cephyse&mdash;yes, you are good and
      brave&mdash;and you were right; for I never loved any but you in the wide
      world; and if, in my degradation, I had one thought that raised me a
      little above the filth, and made me regret that I was not better&mdash;the
      thought was of you! Thanks then, my poor, dear love,&rdquo; said Jacques,
      whose hot and shining eyes were becoming moist; &ldquo;thanks once again,&rdquo;
      and he reached his cold hand to Cephyse; &ldquo;if I die, I shall die
      happy&mdash;if I live, I shall live happy also. Give me your hand, my
      brave Cephyse!&mdash;you have acted like a good and honest creature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of taking the hand which Jacques offered her, Cephyse, still
      kneeling, bowed her head, and dared not raise her eyes to her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t answer,&rdquo; said he, leaning over towards the
      young girl; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t take my hand&mdash;why is this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate creature only answered by stifled sobs. Borne down with
      shame, she held herself in so humble, so supplicating an attitude, that
      her forehead almost touched the feet of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed at the silence and conduct of the Bacchanal Queen, Jacques looked
      at her with increasing agitation; suddenly he stammered out with trembling
      lips, &ldquo;Cephyse, I know you. If you do not take my hand, it is
      because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, his voice failing, he added, in a dull tone, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, &ldquo;When, six weeks ago, I was taken to prison, did you not
      say to me, &lsquo;Jacques, I swear that I will work&mdash;and if need be,
      live in horrible misery&mdash;but I will live true!&rsquo; That was your
      promise. Now, I know you never speak false; tell me you have kept your
      word, and I shall believe you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cephyse only answered by a heart-rending sob, as she pressed the knees of
      Jacques against her heaving bosom. By a strange contradiction, more common
      than is generally thought&mdash;this man, degraded by intoxication and
      debauchery, who, since he came out of prison, had plunged in every excess,
      and tamely yielded to all the fatal incitements of Morok, yet received a
      fearful blow, when he learned, by the mute avowal of Cephyse, the
      infidelity, of this creature, whom he had loved in spite of degradation.
      The first impulse of Jacques was terrible. Notwithstanding his weakness
      and exhaustion, he succeeded in rising from his seat, and, with a
      countenance contracted by rage and despair, he seized a knife, before they
      had time to prevent him, and turned it upon Cephyse. But at the moment he
      was about to strike, shrinking from an act of murder, he hurled the knife
      far away from him, and falling back into the chair, covered his face with
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cry of Ninny Moulin, who had, though late, thrown himself upon
      Jacques to take away the knife, Cephyse raised her head: Jacques&rsquo;s
      woeful dejection wrung her heart; she rose, and fell upon his neck,
      notwithstanding his resistance, exclaiming in a voice broken by sobs,
      &ldquo;Jacques, if you knew! if you only knew&mdash;listen&mdash;do not
      condemn me without hearing me&mdash;I will tell you all, I swear to you&mdash;without
      falsehood&mdash;this man,&rdquo; and she pointed to Morok, &ldquo;will not
      dare deny what I say; he came, and told me to have the courage to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not reproach you. I have no right to reproach you. Let me die
      in peace. I ask nothing but that now,&rdquo; said Jacques, in a still
      weaker voice, as he repulsed Cephyse. Then he added, with a grievous and
      bitter smile, &ldquo;Luckily, I have my dose. I knew&mdash;what I was
      doing&mdash;when I accepted the duel with brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you shall not die, and you shall hear me,&rdquo; cried Cephyse,
      with a bewildered air; &ldquo;you shall hear me, and everybody else shall
      hear me. They shall see that it is not my fault. Is it not so, gentlemen?
      Do I not deserve pity? You will entreat Jacques to forgive me; for if
      driven by misery&mdash;finding no work&mdash;I was forced to this&mdash;not
      for the sake of any luxury&mdash;you see the rags I wear&mdash;but to get
      bread and shelter for my poor, sick sister&mdash;dying, and even more
      miserable than myself&mdash;would you not have pity upon me? Do you think
      one finds pleasure in one&rsquo;s infamy?&rdquo; cried the unfortunate,
      with a burst of frightful laughter; then she added, in a low voice, and
      with a shudder, &ldquo;Oh, if you knew, Jacques! it is so infamous, so
      horrible, that I preferred death to falling so low a second time. I should
      have killed myself, had I not heard you were here.&rdquo; Then, seeing
      that Jacques did not answer her, but shook his head mournfully as he sank
      down though still supported by Ninny Moulin, Cephyse exclaimed, as she
      lifted her clasped hands towards him, &ldquo;Jacques! one word&mdash;for
      pity&rsquo;s sake&mdash;forgive me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, pray remove this woman,&rdquo; cried Morok; &ldquo;the
      sight of her causes my friend too painful emotions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear child, be reasonable,&rdquo; said several of the
      guests, who, deeply moved by this scene, were endeavoring to withdraw
      Cephyse from it; &ldquo;leave him, and come with us; he is not in any
      danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen! oh, gentlemen!&rdquo; cried the unfortunate creature,
      bursting into tears, and raising her hands in supplication; &ldquo;listen
      to me&mdash;I will do all that you wish me&mdash;I will go&mdash;but, in
      heaven&rsquo;s name, send for help, and do not let him die thus. Look,
      what pain he suffers! what horrible convulsions!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; said one of the guests, hastening towards the
      door; &ldquo;we must send for a doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doctor to be found,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;they
      are all too busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do better than that,&rdquo; cried a third; &ldquo;the
      Hospital is just opposite, and we can carry the poor fellow thither. They
      will give him instant help. A leaf of the table will make a litter, and
      the table cloth a covering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that is it,&rdquo; said several voices; &ldquo;let us
      carry him over at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques, burnt up with brandy, and overcome by his interview with Cephyse,
      had again fallen into violent convulsions. It was the dying paroxysm of
      the unfortunate man. They were obliged to tie him with the ends of the
      cloth, so as to secure him to the leaf which was to serve for a litter,
      which two of the guests hastened to carry away. They yielded to the
      supplication of Cephyse, who asked, as a last favor, to accompany Jacques
      to the Hospital. When the mournful procession quitted the great room of
      the eating-house, there was a general flight among the guests. Men and
      women made haste to wrap themselves in their cloaks, in order to conceal
      their costumes. The coaches, which had been ordered in tolerable number
      for the return of the masquerade, had luckily arrived. The defiance had
      been fully carried out, the audacious bravado accomplished, and they could
      now retire with the honors of war. Whilst a part of the guests were still
      in the room, an uproar, at first distant, but which soon drew nearer,
      broke out with incredible fury in the square of Notre Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacques had been carried to the outer door of the tavern. Morok and Ninny
      Moulin, striving to open a passage through the crowd in the direction of
      the Hospital, preceded the litter. A violent reflux of the multitude soon
      forced them to stop, whilst a new storm of savage outcries burst from the
      other extremity of the square, near the angle of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo; asked Ninny Moulin of one of those ignoble
      figures that was leaping up before him. &ldquo;What are those cries?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are making mince-meat of a poisoner, like him they have thrown
      into the river,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;If you want to see the fun,
      follow me close,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;and peg away with your elbows,
      for fear you should be too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the wretch pronounced these words than a dreadful shriek
      sounded above the roar of the crowd, through which the bearers of the
      litter, preceded by Morok, were with difficulty making their way. It was
      Cephyse who uttered that cry. Jacques (one of the seven heirs of the
      Rennepont family) had just expired in her arms! By a strange fatality, at
      the very moment that the despairing exclamation of Cephyse announced that
      death, another cry rose from that part of the square where they were
      attacking the poisoner. That distant, supplicating cry, tremulous with
      horrible alarm, like the last appeal of a man staggering beneath the blows
      of his murderers, chilled the soul of Morok in the midst of his execrable
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; cried the skillful assassin, who had selected
      drunkenness and debauchery for his murderous but legal weapons; &ldquo;it
      is the voice of the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, whom they have in their
      clutches!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE POISONER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is necessary to
      go back a little before relating the adventure of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      whose cry of distress made so deep an impression upon Morok just at the
      moment of Jacques Rennepont&rsquo;s death. We have said that the most
      absurd and alarming reports were circulating in Paris; not only did people
      talk of poison given to the sick or thrown into the public fountains, but
      it was also said that wretches had been surprised in the act of putting
      arsenic into the pots which are usually kept all ready on the counters of
      wine-shops. Goliath was on his way to rejoin Morok, after delivering a
      message to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who was waiting in a house on the
      Place de l&rsquo;Archeveche. He entered a wine-shop in the Rue de la
      Calandre, to get some refreshment, and having drunk two glasses of wine,
      he proceeded to pay for them. Whilst the woman of the house was looking
      for change, Goliath, mechanically and very innocently, rested his hand on
      the mouth of one of the pots that happened to be within his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall stature of this man and his repulsive and savage countenance had
      already alarmed the good woman, whose fears and prejudices had previously
      been roused by the public rumors on the subject of poisoning; but when she
      saw Goliath place his hand over the mouth of one of her pots, she cried
      out in dismay: &ldquo;Oh! my gracious! what are you throwing into that
      pot?&rdquo; At these words, spoken in a loud voice, and with the accent of
      terror, two or three of the drinkers at one of the tables rose
      precipitately, and ran to the counter, while one of them rashly exclaimed:
      &ldquo;It is a poisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goliath, not aware of the reports circulated in the neighborhood, did not
      at first understand of what he was accused. The men raised their voices as
      they called on him to answer the charge; but he, trusting to his strength,
      shrugged his shoulders in disdain, and roughly demanded the change, which
      the pale and frightened hostess no longer thought of giving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rascal!&rdquo; cried one of the men, with so much violence that
      several of the passers-by stopped to listen; &ldquo;you shall have your
      change when you tell us what you threw in the pot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! did he throw anything into the wine-pot?&rdquo; said one of the
      passers by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, perhaps, a poisoner,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be taken up,&rdquo; added a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried those in the house&mdash;honest people
      perhaps, but under the influence of the general panic; &ldquo;he must be
      taken up, for he has been throwing poison into the wine-pots.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words &ldquo;He is a poisoner&rdquo; soon spread through the group,
      which, at first composed of three or four persons, increased every instant
      around the door of the wine-shop. A dull, menacing clamor began to rise
      from the crowd; the first accuser, seeing his fears thus shared and almost
      justified, thought he was acting like a good and courageous citizen in
      taking Goliath by the collar, and saying to him: &ldquo;Come and explain
      yourself at the guard-house, villain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The giant, already provoked at insults of which he did not perceive the
      real meaning, was exasperated at this sudden attack; yielding to his
      natural brutality, he knocked his adversary down upon the counter, and
      began to hammer him with his fists. During this collision, several bottles
      and two or three panes of glass were broken with much noise, whilst the
      woman of the house, more and more frightened, cried out with all her
      might; &ldquo;Help! a poisoner! Help! murder!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the breaking windows and these cries of distress, the
      passers-by, of whom the greater number believed in the stories about the
      poisoners, rushed into the shop to aid in securing Goliath. But the
      latter, thanks to his herculean strength, after struggling for some
      moments with seven or eight persons, knocked down two of his most furious
      assailants, disengaged himself from the others, drew near the counter,
      and, taking a vigorous spring, rushed head-foremost, like a bull about to
      butt, upon the crowd that blocked up the door; then, forcing a passage, by
      the help of his enormous shoulders and athletic arms, he made his way into
      the street, and ran with all speed in the direction of the square of
      Notre-Dame, his garments torn, his head bare, and his countenance pale and
      full of rage. Immediately, a number of persons from amongst the crowd
      started in pursuit of Goliath, and a hundred voices exclaimed: &ldquo;Stop&mdash;stop
      the poisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these cries, and seeing a man draw near with a wild and troubled
      look, a butcher, who happened to be passing with his large, empty tray on
      his head, threw it against Goliath&rsquo;s shins, and taken by surprise,
      he stumbled and fell. The butcher, thinking he had performed as heroic an
      action as if he had encountered a mad dog, flung himself on Goliath, and
      rolled over with him on the pavement, exclaiming: &ldquo;Help! it is a
      poisoner! Help! help!&rdquo; This scene took place not far from the
      Cathedral, but at some distance from the crowd which was pressing round
      the hospital gate, as well as from the eating-house in which the
      masquerade of the cholera then was. The day was now drawing to a close. On
      the piercing call of the butcher, several groups, at the head of which
      were Ciboule and the quarryman, flew towards the scene of the struggle,
      while those who had pursued the pretended poisoner from the Rue de la
      Calandre, reached the square on their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of this threatening crowd advancing towards him, Goliath, whilst
      he continued to defend himself against the butcher, who held him with the
      tenacity of a bull-dog, felt that he was lost unless he could rid himself
      of this adversary before the arrival of the rest; with a furious blow of
      the fist, therefore, he broke the jaw of the butcher, who just then was
      above him, and disengaging himself from his hold, he rose, and staggered a
      few steps forward. Suddenly he stopped. He saw that he was surrounded.
      Behind him rose the walls of the cathedral; to the right and left, and in
      front of him, advanced a hostile multitude. The groans uttered by the
      butcher, who had just been lifted from the ground covered with blood,
      augmented the fury of the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a terrible moment for Goliath: still standing alone in the centre
      of a ring that grew smaller every second, he saw on all sides angry
      enemies rushing towards him, and uttering cries of death. As the wild boar
      turns round once or twice, before resolving to stand at bay and face the
      devouring pack, Goliath, struck with terror, made one or two abrupt and
      wavering movements. Then, as he abandoned the possibility of flight,
      instinct told him that he had no mercy to expect from a crowd given up to
      blind and savage fury&mdash;a fury the more pitiless as it was believed to
      be legitimate. Goliath determined, therefore, at least to sell his life
      dearly; he sought for a knife in his pocket, but, not finding it, he threw
      out his left leg in an athletic posture, and holding up his muscular arms,
      hard and stiff as bars of iron, waited with intrepidity for the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first who approached Goliath was Ciboule. The hag, heated and out of
      breath, instead of rushing upon him, paused, stooped down, and taking off
      one of the large wooden shoes that she wore, hurled it at the giant&rsquo;s
      head with so much force and with so true an aim that it struck him right
      in the eye, which hung half out of its socket. Goliath pressed his hands
      to his face, and uttered a cry of excruciating pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made him squint!&rdquo; said Ciboule, with a burst of
      laughter.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30085.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Goliath, maddened by the pain, instead of waiting for the attack, which
      the mob still hesitated to begin, so greatly were they awed by his
      appearance of herculean strength&mdash;the only adversary worthy to cope
      with him being the quarryman, who had been borne to a distance by the
      surging of the crowd&mdash;Goliath, in his rage, rushed headlong upon the
      nearest. Such a struggle was too unequal to last long; but despair
      redoubled the Colossus&rsquo;s strength, and the combat was for a moment
      terrible. The unfortunate man did not fall at once. For some seconds,
      almost buried amid a swarm of furious assailants, one saw now his mighty
      arm rise and fall like a sledge hammer, beating upon skulls and faces, and
      now his enormous head, livid and bloody, drawn back by some of the
      combatants hanging to his tangled hair. Here and there sudden openings and
      violent oscillations of the crowd bore witness to the incredible energy of
      Goliath&rsquo;s defence. But when the quarryman succeeded in reaching him,
      Goliath was overpowered and thrown down. A long, savage cheer in triumph
      announced this fall; for, under such circumstances, to &ldquo;go under&rdquo;
      is &ldquo;to die.&rdquo; Instantly a thousand breathless and angry voices
      repeated the cry of &ldquo;Death to the poisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began one of those scenes of massacre and torture, worthy of
      cannibals, horrible to relate, and the more incredible, that they happen
      almost always in the presence, and often with the aid, of honest and
      humane people, who, blinded by false notions and stupid prejudices, allow
      themselves to be led into all sorts of barbarity, under the idea of
      performing an act of inexorable justice. As it frequently happens, the
      sight of the blood which flowed in torrents from Goliath&rsquo;s wounds
      inflamed to madness the rage of his assailants. A hundred fists struck at
      the unhappy man; he was stamped under foot, his face and chest were beaten
      in. Ever and anon, in the midst of furious cries of &ldquo;Death to the
      poisoner!&rdquo; heavy blows were audible, followed by stifled groans. It
      was a frightful butchery. Each individual, yielding to a sanguinary
      frenzy, came in turn to strike his blow; or to tear off his morsel of
      flesh. Women&mdash;yes, women&mdash;mothers!&mdash;came to spend their
      rage on this mutilated form.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one moment of frightful terror. With his face all bruised and
      covered with mud, his garments in rags, his chest bare, red, gaping with
      wounds&mdash;Goliath, availing himself of a moment&rsquo;s weariness on
      the part of his assassins, who believed him already, finished, succeeded,
      by one of those convulsive starts frequent in the last agony, in raising
      himself to his feet for a few seconds; then, blind with wounds and loss of
      blood, striking about his arms in the air as if to parry blows that were
      no longer struck, he muttered these words, which came from his mouth,
      accompanied by a crimson torrent: &ldquo;Mercy! I am no poisoner. Mercy!&rdquo;
      This sort of resurrection produced so great an effect on the crowd, that
      for an instant they fell hack affrighted. The clamor ceased, and a small
      space was left around the victim. Some hearts began even to feel pity;
      when the quarryman, seeing Goliath blinded with blood, groping before him
      with his hands, exclaimed in ferocious allusion to a well-known game:
      &ldquo;Now for blind-man&rsquo;s-bluff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a violent kick, he again threw down the victim, whose head
      struck twice heavily on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the giant fell a voice from amongst the crowd exclaimed: &ldquo;It
      is Goliath! stop! he is innocent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who, yielding to a generous impulse, was
      making violent efforts to reach the foremost rank of the actors in this
      scene, and who cried out, as he came nearer, pale, indignant, menacing:
      &ldquo;You are cowards and murderers! This man is innocent. I know him.
      You shall answer for his life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These vehement words were received with loud murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that poisoner,&rdquo; cried the quarryman, seizing the
      Jesuit by the collar; &ldquo;then perhaps you are a poisoner too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch,&rdquo; exclaimed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, endeavoring to
      shake himself loose from the grasp, &ldquo;do you dare to lay hand upon
      me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare do anything,&rdquo; answered the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows him: he&rsquo;s a poisoner like the other,&rdquo; cried
      the crowd, pressing round the two adversaries; whilst Goliath, who had
      fractured his skull in the fall, uttered a long death-rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sudden movement of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who disengaged himself
      from the quarryman, a large glass phial of peculiar form, very thick, and
      filled with a greenish liquor, fell from his pocket, and rolled close to
      the dying Goliath. At sight of this phial, many voices exclaimed together:
      &ldquo;It is poison! Only see! He had poison upon him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clamor redoubled at this accusation, and they pressed so close to Abbe
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny, that he exclaimed: &ldquo;Do not touch me! do not
      approach me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is a poisoner,&rdquo; said a voice, &ldquo;no more mercy for
      him than for the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I a poisoner?&rdquo; said the abbe, struck with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ciboule had darted upon the phial; the quarryman seized it from her,
      uncorked it and presenting it to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, said to him:
      &ldquo;Now tell us what is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not poison,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then drink it!&rdquo; returned the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! let him drink it!&rdquo; cried the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in extreme alarm.
      And he drew back as he spoke, pushing away the phial with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see? It is poison. He dares not drink it,&rdquo; they
      exclaimed. Hemmed in on every side, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny stumbled
      against the body of Goliath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; cried the Jesuit, who, without being a poisoner,
      found himself exposed to a terrible alternative, for his phial contained
      aromatic salts of extraordinary strength, designed for a preservative
      against the cholera, and as dangerous to swallow as any poison, &ldquo;my
      good friends, you are in error. I conjure you, in the name of heaven&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is not poison, drink it!&rdquo; interrupted the quarryman,
      as he again offered the bottle to the Jesuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does not drink it, death to the poisoner of the poor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&mdash;death to him! death to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy men!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, whilst his hair
      stood on end with terror; &ldquo;do you mean to murder me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about all those, that you and your mate have killed, you
      wretch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not true&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, then!&rdquo; repeated the inflexible quarryman; &ldquo;I ask
      you for the last time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To drink that would be death,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! only hear the wretch!&rdquo; cried the mob, pressing closer to
      him; &ldquo;he has confessed&mdash;he has confessed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has betrayed himself!&rdquo;(40)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;to drink that would be death!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen to me,&rdquo; cried the abbe, clasping his hands
      together; &ldquo;this phial is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Furious cries interrupted Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;Ciboule, make an
      end of that one!&rdquo; cried the quarryman, spurning Goliath with his
      foot. &ldquo;I will begin this one!&rdquo; And he seized Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      by the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, two different groups formed themselves. One, led by
      Ciboule, &ldquo;made an end&rdquo; of Goliath, with kicks and blows,
      stones and wooden shoes; his body was soon reduced to a horrible thing,
      mutilated, nameless, formless&mdash;a mere inert mass of filth and mangled
      flesh. Ciboule gave her cloak, which they tied to one of the dislocated
      ankles of the body, and thus dragged it to the parapet of the quay. There,
      with shouts of ferocious joy, they precipitated the bloody remains into
      the river. Now who does not shudder at the thought that, in a time of
      popular commotion, a word, a single word, spoken imprudently, even by an
      honest man, and without hatred, will suffice to provoke so horrible a
      murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is a poisoner!&rdquo; said one of the drinkers in the
      tavern of the Rue de la Calandre&mdash;nothing more&mdash;and Goliath had
      been pitilessly murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      What imperious reasons for penetrating the lowest depths of the masses
      with instruction and with light&mdash;to enable unfortunate creatures to
      defend themselves from so many stupid prejudices, so many fatal
      superstitions, so much implacable fanaticism!&mdash;How can we ask for
      calmness, reflection, self-control, or the sentiment of justice from
      abandoned beings, whom ignorance has brutalized, and misery depraved, and
      suffering made ferocious, and of whom society takes no thought, except
      when it chains them to the galleys, or binds them ready for the
      executioner! The terrible cry which had so startled Morok was uttered by
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny as the quarryman laid his formidable hand upon
      him, saying to Ciboule: &ldquo;Make an end of that one&mdash;I will begin
      this one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (40) This fact is historical. A man was murdered because a phial full of
      ammonia was found upon him. On his refusal to drink it, the populace,
      persuaded that the bottle contained poison, tore him to pieces.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. IN THE CATHEDRAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ight was almost
      come, as the mutilated body of Goliath was thrown into the river. The
      oscillations of the mob had carried into the street, which runs along the
      left side of the cathedral, the group into whose power Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      had fallen. Having succeeded in freeing himself from the grasp of the
      quarryman, but still closely pressed by the multitude that surrounded him,
      crying, &ldquo;Death to the poisoner!&rdquo; he retreated step by step,
      trying to parry the blows that were dealt him. By presence of mind,
      address, and courage, recovering at that critical moment his old military
      energy, he had hitherto been able to resist and to remain firm on his feet&mdash;knowing,
      by the example of Goliath, that to fall was to die. Though he had little
      hope of being heard to any purpose, the abbe continued to call for help
      with all his might. Disputing the ground inch by inch, he manoeuvred so as
      to draw near one of the lateral walls of the church, and at length
      succeeded in ensconcing himself in a corner formed by the projection of a
      buttress, and close by a little door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This position was rather favorable. Leaning with his back against the
      wall, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny was sheltered from the attacks of a portion
      of his assailants. But the quarryman, wishing to deprive him of this last
      chance of safety, rushed upon him, with the intention of dragging him out
      into the circle where he would have been trampled under foot. The fear of
      death gave Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny extraordinary strength, and he was able
      once more to repulse the quarryman, and remain entrenched in the corner
      where he had taken refuge. The resistance of the victim redoubled the rage
      of the assailants. Cries of murderous import resounded with new violence.
      The quarryman again rushed upon Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, saying, &ldquo;Follow
      me, friends! this lasts too long. Let us make an end of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny saw that he was lost. His strength was exhausted,
      and he felt himself sinking; his legs trembled under him, and a cloud
      obscured his sight; the howling of the furious mob began to sound dull
      upon his ear. The effects of violent contusions, received during the
      struggle, both on the head and chest, were now very perceptible. Two or
      three times, a mixture of blood and foam rose to the lips of the abbe; his
      position was a desperate one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be slaughtered by these brutes, after escaping death so often in
      war!&rdquo; Such was the thought of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, as the
      quarryman rushed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, at the very moment when the abbe, yielding to the instinct of
      self-preservation, uttered one last call for help, in a heart-piercing
      voice, the door against which he leaned opened behind him, and a firm hand
      caught hold of him, and pulled him into the church. Thanks to this
      movement, performed with the rapidity of lightning, the quarryman, thrown
      forward in his attempt to seize Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, could not check
      his progress, and found himself just opposite to the person who had come,
      as it were, to take the place of the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarryman stopped short, and then fell back a couple of paces, so much
      was he amazed at this sudden apparition, and impressed, like the rest of
      the crowd, with a vague feeling of admiration and respect at sight of him
      who had come so miraculously to the aid of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. It was
      Gabriel. The young missionary remained standing on the threshold of the
      door. His long black cassock was half lost in the shadows of the
      cathedral; whilst his angelic countenance, with its border of long light
      hair, now pale and agitated by pity and grief, was illumined by the last
      faint rays of twilight. This countenance shone with so divine a beauty,
      and expressed such touching and tender compassion, that the crowd felt
      awed as, with his large blue eyes full of tears, and his hands clasped
      together, he exclaimed, in a sonorous voice: &ldquo;Have mercy, my
      brethren! Be humane&mdash;be just!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering from his first feeling of surprise and involuntary emotion, the
      quarryman advanced a step towards Gabriel, and said to him: &ldquo;No
      mercy for the poisoner! we must have him! Give him up to us, or we go and
      take him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot think of it, my brethren,&rdquo; answered Gabriel;
      &ldquo;the church is a sacred place&mdash;a place of refuge for the
      persecuted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would drag our prisoner from the altar!&rdquo; answered the
      quarryman, roughly; &ldquo;so give him up to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my brethren,&rdquo; said Gabriel, extending his arms
      towards them.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30093.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with the shaveling!&rdquo; cried the quarryman; &ldquo;let us
      go in and hunt him up in the church!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried the mob, again led away by the violence of
      this wretch, &ldquo;down with the black gown!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all of a piece!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us do as we did at the archbishop&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at Saint-Germain-l&rsquo;Auxerrois!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do our likes care for a church?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the priests defend the poisoners, we&rsquo;ll pitch them into
      the water too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the lead!&rdquo; cried the quarryman; and
      followed by Ciboule, and a good number of determined men, he rushed
      towards Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary, who for some moments had watched the increasing fury of
      the crowd, had foreseen this movement; hastily retreating into the church,
      he succeeded, in spite of the efforts of the assailants, in nearly closing
      the door, and in barricading it by the help of a wooden bar, which he held
      in such a manner as would enable the door to resist for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he thus defended the entrance, Gabriel shouted to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
      &ldquo;Fly, father! fly through the vestry! the other doors are fastened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit, overpowered by fatigue, covered with contusions, bathed in
      cold sweat, feeling his strength altogether fail, and too soon fancying
      himself in safety, had sunk, half fainting, into a chair. At the voice of
      Gabriel, he rose with difficulty, and, with a trembling step, endeavored
      to reach the choir, separated from the rest of the church by an iron
      railing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, father!&rdquo; added Gabriel, in alarm, using every effort
      to maintain the door, which was now vigorously assailed. &ldquo;Make
      haste! In a few minutes it will be too late. All alone!&rdquo; continued
      the missionary, in despair, &ldquo;alone, to arrest the progress of these
      madmen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was indeed alone. At the first outbreak of the attack, three or four
      sacristans and other members of the establishment were in the church; but,
      struck with terror, and remembering the sack of the archbishop&rsquo;s
      palace, and of Saint-Germain-l&rsquo;Auxerrois, they had immediately taken
      flight. Some of them had concealed themselves in the organ-loft and others
      fled into the vestry, the doors of which they locked after them, thus
      cutting off the retreat of Gabriel and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. The
      latter, bent double by pain, yet roused by the missionary&rsquo;s
      portentive warning, helping himself on by means of the chairs he met with
      on his passage, made vain efforts to reach the choir railing. After
      advancing a few steps, vanquished by his suffering, he staggered and fell
      upon the pavement, deprived of sense and motion. At the same moment,
      Gabriel, in spite of the incredible energy with which the desire to save
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had inspired him, felt the door giving way beneath
      the formidable pressure from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his head, to see if the Jesuit had at least quitted the church,
      Gabriel, to his great alarm, perceived that he was lying motionless at a
      few steps from the choir. To abandon the half-broken door, to run to
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, to lift him in his arms, and drag him within the
      railing of the choir, was for the young priest an action rapid as thought;
      for he closed the gate of the choir just at the instant that the quarryman
      and his band, having finished breaking down the door, rushed in a body
      into the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in front of the choir, with his arms crossed upon his breast,
      Gabriel waited calmly and intrepidly for this mob, still more exasperated
      by such unexpected resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door once forced, the assailants rushed in with great violence. But
      hardly had they entered the church, than a strange scene took place. It
      was nearly dark; only a few silver lamps shed their pale light round the
      sanctuary, whose far outlines disappeared in the shadow. On suddenly
      entering the immense cathedral, dark, silent, and deserted, the most
      audacious were struck with awe, almost with fear in presence of the
      imposing grandeur of that stony solitude. Outcries and threats died away
      on the lips of the most furious. They seemed to dread awaking the echoes
      of those enormous arches, those black vaults, from which oozed a
      sepulchral dampness, which chilled their brows, inflamed with anger, and
      fell upon their shoulders like a mantle of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Religious tradition, routine, habit, the memories of childhood, have so
      much influence upon men, that hardly had they entered the church, than
      several of the quarryman&rsquo;s followers respectfully took off their
      hats, bowed their bare heads, and walked along cautiously, as if to check
      the noise of their footsteps on the sounding stones. Then they exchanged a
      few words in a low and fearful whisper. Others timidly raised their eyes
      to the far heights of the topmost arches of that gigantic building, now
      lost in obscurity, and felt almost frightened to see themselves so little
      in the midst of that immensity of darkness. But at the first joke of the
      quarryman, who broke this respectful silence, the emotion soon passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood and thunder!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;are you fetching breath
      to sing vespers? If they had wine in the font, well and good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were received with a burst of savage laughter. &ldquo;All this
      time the villain will escape!&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall be done,&rdquo; added Ciboule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think we had cowards here, who are afraid of the
      sacristans!&rdquo; cried the quarryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; replied the others in chorus; &ldquo;we fear nobody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;forward!&rdquo; was repeated on all sides. And the
      animation, which had been calmed down for a moment, was redoubled in the
      midst of renewed tumult. Some moments after, the eyes of the assailants,
      becoming accustomed to the twilight, were able to distinguish in the midst
      of the faint halo shed around by a silver lamp, the imposing countenance
      of Gabriel, as he stood before the iron railing of the choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poisoner is here, hid in some corner,&rdquo; cried the
      quarryman. &ldquo;We must force this parson to give us back the villain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall answer for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took him into the church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall pay for both, if we do not find the other!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the first impression of involuntary respect was effaced from the minds
      of the crowd, their voices rose the louder, and their faces became the
      more savage and threatening, because they all felt ashamed of their
      momentary hesitation and weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried many voices, trembling with rage, &ldquo;we
      must have the life of one or the other!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or of both!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the worse for this priest, if he wants to prevent us from
      serving out our poisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death to him! death to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this burst of ferocious yells, which were fearfully re-echoed from
      the groined arches of the cathedral, the mob, maddened by rage, rushed
      towards the choir, at the door of which Gabriel was standing. The young
      missionary, who, when placed on the cross by the savages of the Rocky
      Mountains, yet entreated heaven to spare his executioners, had too much
      courage in his heart, too much charity in his soul, not to risk his life a
      thousand times over to save Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s&mdash;the very
      man who had betrayed hire by such cowardly and cruel hypocrisy.

      CHAPTER XXV. THE MURDERERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he quarryman,
      followed by his gang, ran towards Gabriel, who had advanced a few paces
      from the choir-railing, and exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with rage:
      &ldquo;Where is the poisoner? We will have him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has told you, my brethren, that he is a poisoner?&rdquo;
      replied Gabriel, with his deep, sonorous voice. &ldquo;A poisoner! Where
      are the proofs&mdash;witnesses or victims?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of that stuff! we are not here for confession,&rdquo;
      brutally answered the quarryman, advancing towards him in a threatening
      manner. &ldquo;Give up the man to us; he shall be forthcoming, unless you
      choose to stand in his shoes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed several voices; &ldquo;they are &lsquo;in&rsquo;
      with one another! One or the other we will have!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; since it is so,&rdquo; said Gabriel, raising his
      head, and advancing with calmness, resignation; and fearlessness; &ldquo;he
      or me,&rdquo; added he;&mdash;&ldquo;it seems to make no difference to you&mdash;you
      are determined to have blood&mdash;take mine, and I will pardon you, my
      friends; for a fatal delusion has unsettled your reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of Gabriel, his courage, the nobleness of his attitude, the
      beauty of his countenance, had made an impression on some of the
      assailants, when suddenly a voice exclaimed: &ldquo;Look! there is the
      poisoner, behind the railing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where?&rdquo; cried they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;stretched on the floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this, the mob, which had hitherto formed a compact mass, in the
      sort of passage separating the two sides of the nave, between the rows of
      chairs, dispersed in every direction, to reach the railing of the choir,
      the last and only barrier that now sheltered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      During this manoeuvre the quarryman, Ciboule, and others, advanced towards
      Gabriel, exclaiming, with ferocious joy: &ldquo;This time we have him.
      Death to the poisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To save Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, Gabriel would have allowed himself to be
      massacred at the entrance of the choir; but, a little further on, the
      railing, not above four feet in height, would in another instant be scaled
      or broken through. The Missionary lost all hope of saving the Jesuit from
      a frightful death. Yet he exclaimed: &ldquo;Stop, poor deluded people!&rdquo;&mdash;and,
      extending his arms, he threw himself in front of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words, gesture, and countenance, were expressive of an authority at
      once so affectionate and so fraternal, that there was a momentary
      hesitation amongst the mob. But to this hesitation soon succeeded the most
      furious cries of &ldquo;Death; death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cry for his death?&rdquo; cried Gabriel, growing still paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him die,&rdquo; cried the missionary, inspired with a
      sudden thought; &ldquo;let him die on the instant!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of the young priest struck the crowd with amazement. For a few
      moments, they all stood mute, motionless, and as it were, paralyzed,
      looking at Gabriel in stupid astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man is guilty, you say,&rdquo; resumed the young missionary,
      in a voice trembling with emotion. &ldquo;You have condemned him without
      proof, without witnesses&mdash;no matter, he must die. You reproach him
      with being a poisoner; where are his victims? You cannot tell&mdash;but no
      matter; he is condemned. You refuse to hear his defense, the sacred right
      of every accused person&mdash;no matter; the sentence is pronounced. You
      are at once his accusers, judges, and executioners. Be it so!&mdash;You
      have never seen till now this unfortunate man, he has done you no harm, he
      has perhaps not done harm to any one&mdash;yet you take upon yourselves
      the terrible responsibility of his death&mdash;understand me well&mdash;of
      his death. Be it so then! your conscience will absolve you&mdash;I will
      believe it. He must die; the sacredness of God&rsquo;s house will not save
      him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried many furious voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; resumed Gabriel, with increasing warmth; &ldquo;no you
      have determined to shed his blood, and you will shed it, even in the Lord&rsquo;s
      temple. It is, you say, your right. You are doing an act of terrible
      justice. But why then, so many vigorous arms to make an end of one dying
      man? Why these outcries? this fury? this violence? Is it thus that the
      people, the strong and equitable people, are wont to execute their
      judgments? No, no; when sure of their right, they strike their enemies, it
      is with the calmness of the judge, who, in freedom of soul and conscience,
      passes sentence. No, the strong and equitable people do not deal their
      blows like men blind or mad, uttering cries of rage, as if to drown the
      sense of some cowardly and horrible murder. No, it is not thus that they
      exercise the formidable right, to which you now lay claim&mdash;for you
      will have it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we will have it!&rdquo; shouted the quarryman, Ciboule, and
      others of the more pitiless portion of the mob; whilst a great number
      remained silent, struck with the words of Gabriel, who had just painted to
      them, in such lively colors, the frightful act they were about to commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed the quarryman, &ldquo;it is our right; we have
      determined to kill the poisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and with bloodshot eyes, and flushed cheek, the wretch advanced
      at the head of a resolute group, making a gesture as though he would have
      pushed aside Gabriel, who was still standing in front of the railing. But
      instead of resisting the bandit, the missionary advanced a couple of steps
      to meet him, took him by the arm, and said in a firm voice: &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And dragging, as it were, with him the stupefied quarryman, whose
      companions did not venture to follow at the moment, struck dumb as they
      were by this new incident, Gabriel rapidly traversed the space which
      separated him from the choir, opened the iron gate, and, still holding the
      quarryman by the arm, led him up to the prostrate form of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      and said to him: &ldquo;There is the victim. He is condemned. Strike!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rdquo; cried the quarryman, hesitating; &ldquo;I&mdash;all alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Gabriel, with bitterness, &ldquo;there is no
      danger. You can easily finish him. Look! he is broken down with suffering;
      he has hardly a breath of life left; he will make no resistance. Do not be
      afraid!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarryman remained motionless, whilst the crowd, strangely impressed
      with this incident, approached a little nearer the railing, without daring
      to come within the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike then!&rdquo; resumed Gabriel, addressing the quarryman,
      whilst he pointed to the crowd with a solemn gesture; &ldquo;there are the
      judges; you are the executioner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the quarryman, drawing back, and turning away his
      eyes; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the executioner&mdash;not I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd remained silent. For a few moments, not a word, not a cry,
      disturbed the stillness of the solemn cathedral. In a desperate case,
      Gabriel had acted with a profound knowledge of the human heart. When the
      multitude, inflamed with blind rage, rushes with ferocious clamor upon a
      single victim, and each man strikes his blow, this dreadful species of
      combined murder appears less horrible to each, because they all share in
      the common crime; and then the shouts, the sight of blood, the desperate
      defence of the man they massacre, finish by producing a sort of ferocious
      intoxication; but, amongst all those furious madmen, who take part in the
      homicide, select one, and place him face to face with the victim, no
      longer capable of resistance, and say to him, &ldquo;Strike!&rdquo;&mdash;he
      will hardly ever dare to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus with the quarryman; the wretch trembled at the idea of
      committing a murder in cold blood, &ldquo;all alone.&rdquo; The preceding
      scene had passed very rapidly; amongst the companions of the quarryman,
      nearest to the railing, some did not understand an impression, which they
      would themselves have felt as strongly as this bold man, if it had been
      said to them: &ldquo;Do the office of executioner!&rdquo; These,
      therefore, began to murmur aloud at his weakness. &ldquo;He dares not
      finish the poisoner,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coward!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He draws back.&rdquo; Hearing these words, the quarryman ran to the
      gate, threw it wide open, and, pointing to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      exclaimed: &ldquo;If there is one here braver than I am, let him go and
      finish the job&mdash;let him be, the executioner&mdash;come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this proposal the murmurs ceased. A deep silence reigned once more in
      the cathedral. All those countenances, but now so furious, became sad,
      confused, almost frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deluded mob began to appreciate the ferocious cowardice of the action
      it had been about to commit. Not one durst go alone to strike the half
      expiring man. Suddenly, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny uttered a dying rattle,
      his head and one of his arms stirred with a convulsive movement, and then
      fell back upon the stones as if he had just expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel uttered a cry of anguish, and threw himself on his knees close to
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, exclaiming: &ldquo;Great Heaven! he is dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a singular variableness in the mind of a crowd, susceptible alike
      to good or evil impressions. At the heart-piercing cry of Gabriel, all
      these people, who, a moment before, had demanded, with loud uproar, the
      massacre of this man, felt touched with a sudden pity. The words: &ldquo;He
      is dead!&rdquo; circulated in low whispers through the crowd accompanied
      by a slight shudder, whilst Gabriel raised with one hand the victim&rsquo;s
      heavy head, and with the other sought to feel if the pulse still beat
      beneath the ice-cold skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Curate,&rdquo; said the quarryman, bending towards Gabriel,
      &ldquo;is there really no hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was waited for with anxiety, in the midst of deep silence. The
      people hardly ventured to exchange a few words in whispers.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God!&rdquo; exclaimed Gabriel, suddenly. &ldquo;His
      heart beats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His heart beats,&rdquo; repeated the quarryman, turning his head
      towards the crowd, to inform them of the good news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! his heart beats!&rdquo; repeated the others, in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is hope. We may yet save him,&rdquo; added Gabriel with an
      expression of indescribable happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may yet save him,&rdquo; repeated the quarryman, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may yet save him,&rdquo; muttered the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick,&rdquo; resumed Gabriel, addressing the quarryman;
      &ldquo;help me, brother. Let us carry him to a neighboring house, where he
      can have immediate aid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarryman obeyed with readiness. Whilst the missionary lifted Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      by holding him under the arms, the quarryman took the legs of the almost
      inanimate body. Together, they carried him outside of the choir. At sight
      of the formidable quarryman, aiding the young priest to render assistance
      to the man whom he had just before pursued with menaces of death, the
      multitude felt a sudden thrill of compassion. Yielding to the powerful
      influence of the words and example of Gabriel, they felt themselves deeply
      moved, and each became anxious to offer services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Curate, he would perhaps be better on a chair, that one could
      carry upright,&rdquo; said Ciboule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go and fetch a stretcher from the hospital?&rdquo; asked
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Curate, let me take your place; the body is too heavy for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself,&rdquo; said a powerful man,
      approaching the missionary respectfully; &ldquo;I can carry him alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I run and fetch a coach, Mr. Curate?&rdquo; said a young
      vagabond, taking off his red cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said the quarryman; &ldquo;run away, my buck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first, ask Mr. Curate if you are to go for a coach,&rdquo; said
      Ciboule, stopping the impatient messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; added one of the bystanders; &ldquo;we are here in a
      church, and Mr. Curate has the command. He is at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; go at once, my child,&rdquo; said Gabriel to the obliging
      young vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the latter was making his way through the crowd, a voice said:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a little wicker-bottle of brandy; will that be of any
      use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; answered Gabriel, hastily; &ldquo;pray give it
      here. We can rub his temples with the spirit, and make him inhale a
      little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass the bottle,&rdquo; cried Ciboule; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t put
      your noses in it!&rdquo; And, passed with caution from hand to hand, the
      flask reached Gabriel in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst waiting for the coming of the coach, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had
      been seated on a chair. Whilst several good-natured people carefully
      supported the abbe, the missionary made him inhale a little brandy. In a
      few minutes, the spirit had a powerful influence on the Jesuit; he made
      some slight movements, and his oppressed bosom heaved with a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is saved&mdash;he will live,&rdquo; cried Gabriel, in a
      triumphant voice; &ldquo;he will live, my brothers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! glad to hear it!&rdquo; exclaimed many voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! be glad, my brothers!&rdquo; repeated Gabriel; &ldquo;for,
      instead of being weighed down with the remorse of crime, you will have a
      just and charitable action to remember. Let us thank God, that he has
      changed your blind fury into a sentiment of compassion! Let us pray to
      Him, that neither you, nor those you love, may ever be exposed to such
      frightful danger as this unfortunate man has just escaped. Oh, my
      brothers!&rdquo; added Gabriel, as he pointed to the image of Christ with
      touching emotion, which communicated itself the more easily to others from
      the expression of his angelic countenance; &ldquo;oh, my brothers! let us
      never forget, that HE, who died upon that cross for the defence of the
      oppressed, for the obscure children of the people like to ourselves,
      pronounced those affectionate words so sweet to the heart; &lsquo;Love ye
      one another!&rsquo;&mdash;Let us never forget it; let us love and help one
      another, and we poor people shall then become better, happier, just. Love&mdash;yes,
      love ye one another&mdash;and fall prostrate before that Saviour, who is
      the God of all that are weak, oppressed, and suffering in this world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Gabriel knelt down. All present respectfully followed his
      example, such power was there in his simple and persuasive words. At this
      moment, a singular incident added to the grandeur of the scene. We have
      said that a few seconds before the quarryman and his band entered the body
      of the church, several persons had fled from it. Two of these had taken
      refuge in the organ-loft, from which retreat they had viewed the preceding
      scene, themselves remaining invisible. One of these persons was a young
      man charged with the care of the organ, and quite musician enough to play
      on it. Deeply moved by the unexpected turn of an event which at first
      appeared so tragical, and yielding to an artistical inspiration, this
      young man, at the moment when he saw the people kneeling with Gabriel,
      could not forbear striking the notes. Then a sort of harmonious sigh, at
      first almost insensible, seemed to rise from the midst of this immense
      cathedral, like a divine aspiration. As soft and aerial as the balmy vapor
      of incense, it mounted and spread through the lofty arches. Little by
      little the faint, sweet sounds, though still as it were covered, changed
      to an exquisite melody, religious, melancholy, and affectionate, which
      rose to heaven like a song of ineffable gratitude and love. And the notes
      were at first so faint, so covered, that the kneeling multitude had
      scarcely felt surprise, and had yielded insensibly to the irresistible
      influence of that enchanting harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then many an eye, until now dry and ferocious, became wet with tears&mdash;many
      hard hearts beat gently, as they remembered the words pronounced by
      Gabriel with so tender an accent: &ldquo;Love ye one another!&rdquo; It
      was at this moment that Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny came to himself&mdash;and
      opened his eyes. He thought himself under the influence of a dream. He had
      lost his senses in sight of a furious populace, who, with insult and
      blasphemy on their lips, pursued him with cries of death even to the
      sanctuary of the temple. He opened his eyes&mdash;and, by the pale light
      of the sacred lamps, to the solemn music of the organ, he saw that crowd,
      just now so menacing and implacable, kneeling in mute and reverential
      emotion, and humbly bowing their heads before the majesty of the shrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes after, Gabriel, carried almost in triumph on the shoulders of
      the crowd, entered the coach, in which Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who by
      degrees had completely recovered his senses, was already reclining. By the
      order of the Jesuit, the coach stopped before the door of a house in the
      Rue de Vaugirard; he had the strength and courage to enter this dwelling
      alone; Gabriel was not admitted, but we shall conduct the reader thither.

      CHAPTER XXVI. THE PATIENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the end of the
      Rue de Vaugirard, there was then a very high wall, with only one small
      doorway in all its length. On opening this door, you entered a yard
      surrounded by a railing, with screens like Venetian blinds, to prevent
      your seeing between the rails. Crossing this courtyard, you come to a fine
      large garden, symmetrically planted, at the end of which stood a building
      two stories high, looking perfectly comfortable, without luxury, but with
      all that cozy simplicity which betokens discreet opulence. A few days had
      elapsed since Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had been so courageously rescued by
      Gabriel from the popular fury. Three ecclesiastics, wearing black gowns,
      white bands, and square caps, were walking in the garden with a slow and
      measured step. The youngest seemed to be about thirty years of age; his
      countenance was pale, hollow, and impressed with a certain ascetic
      austerity. His two companions, aged between fifty or sixty, had, on the
      contrary, faces at once hypocritical and cunning; their round, rosy cheeks
      shone brightly in the sunshine, whilst their triple chins, buried in fat,
      descended in soft folds over the fine cambric of their bands. According to
      the rules of their order (they belonged to the Society of Jesus), which
      forbade their walking only two together, these three members of the
      brotherhood never quitted each other a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said one of the two, continuing a conversation
      already begun, and speaking of an absent person, &ldquo;I fear, that the
      continual agitation to which the reverend father has been a prey, ever
      since he was attacked with the cholera, has exhausted his strength, and
      caused the dangerous relapse which now makes us fear for his life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;that never was there
      seen anxiety like to his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And moreover,&rdquo; remarked the young priest, bitterly, &ldquo;it
      is painful to think, that his reverence Father Rodin has given cause for
      scandal, by obstinately refusing to make a public confession, the day
      before yesterday when his situation appeared so desperate, that, between
      two fits of a delirium, it was thought right to propose to him to receive
      the last sacraments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His reverence declared that he was not so ill as they supposed,&rdquo;
      answered one of the fathers, &ldquo;and that he would have the last duties
      performed when he thought necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, that for the last ten days, ever since he was brought
      here dying, his life has been, as it were, only a long and painful agony;
      and yet he continues to live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I watched by him during the first three days of his malady, with M.
      Rousselet, the pupil of Dr. Baleinier,&rdquo; resumed the youngest father;
      &ldquo;he had hardly a moment&rsquo;s consciousness, and when the Lord did
      grant him a lucid interval, he employed it in detestable execrations
      against the fate which had confined him to his bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;that Father Rodin made
      answer to his Eminence Cardinal Malipieri, who came to persuade him to die
      in an exemplary manner, worthy of a son of Loyola, our blessed founder&rdquo;&mdash;at
      these words, the three Jesuits bowed their heads together, as if they had
      been all moved by the same spring&mdash;&ldquo;it is said, that Father
      Rodin made answer to his eminence: &lsquo;I do not need to confess
      publicly; I WANT TO LIVE, AND I WILL LIVE.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hear that,&rdquo; said the young priest, with an
      indignant air; &ldquo;but if Father Rodin really made use of such
      expressions, it is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, no doubt, reflection came to him just in time, for he stole a
      sidelong glance at his two silent, impassible companions, and added:
      &ldquo;It is a great misfortune for his soul; but I am certain, his
      reverence has been slandered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only as a calumnious report, that I mentioned those words,&rdquo;
      said the other priest, exchanging a glance with his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the garden gates opened, and one of the three reverend fathers
      exclaimed, at the sight of the personage who now entered: &ldquo;Oh! here
      is his Eminence Cardinal Malipieri, coming to pay a visit to Father Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May this visit of his eminence,&rdquo; said the young priest,
      calmly, &ldquo;be more profitable to Father Rodin than the last!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal Malipieri was crossing the garden, on his way to the apartment
      occupied by Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinal Malipieri, whom we saw assisting at the sort of council held at
      the Princess de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s, now on his way to Rodin&rsquo;s
      apartment, was dressed as a layman, but enveloped in an ample pelisse of
      puce-colored satin, which exhaled a strong odor of camphor, for the
      prelate had taken care to surround himself with all sorts of anti-cholera
      specifics. Having reached the second story of the house, the cardinal
      knocked at a little gray door. Nobody answering, he opened it, and, like a
      man to whom the locality was well known, passed through a sort of
      antechamber, and entered a room in which was a turn-up bed. On a black
      wood table were many phials, which had contained different medicines. The
      prelate&rsquo;s countenance seemed uneasy and morose; his complexion was
      still yellow and bilious; the brown circle which surrounded his black,
      squinting eyes appeared still darker than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing a moment, he looked round him almost in fear, and several times
      stopped to smell at his anti-cholera bottle. Then, seeing he was alone, he
      approached a glass over the chimney-piece, and examined with much
      attention the color of his tongue; after some minutes spent in this
      careful investigation, with the result of which he appeared tolerably
      satisfied, he took some preservative lozenges out of a golden box, and
      allowed them to melt in his mouth, whilst he closed his eyes with a
      sanctified air. Having taken these sanitary precautions, and again pressed
      his bottle to his nose, the prelate prepared to enter the third room, when
      he heard a tolerably loud noise through the thin partition which separated
      him from it, and, stopping to listen, all that was said in the next
      apartment easily reached his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that my wounds are dressed, I will get up,&rdquo; said weak,
      but sharp and imperious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think of it, reverend father,&rdquo; was answered in a
      stronger tone; &ldquo;it is impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see if it is impossible,&rdquo; replied the other voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, reverend father, you will kill yourself. You are not in a
      state to get up. You will expose yourself to a mortal relapse. I cannot
      consent to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To these words succeeded the noise of a faint struggle, mingled with
      groans more angry than plaintive, and the voice resumed: &ldquo;No, no,
      father; for your own safety, I will not leave your clothes within your
      reach. It is almost time for your medicine; I will go and prepare it for
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately after, the door opened, and the prelate saw enter a man
      of about twenty-five years of age, carrying on his arm an old olive
      great-coat and threadbare black trousers, which he threw down upon a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This personage was Ange Modeste Rousselet, chief pupil of Dr. Baleinier;
      the countenance of the young practitioner was mild, humble, and reserved;
      his hair, very short in front, flowed down upon his neck behind. He made a
      slight start in surprise on perceiving the cardinal, and bowed twice very
      low, without raising his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before anything else,&rdquo; said the prelate, with his marked
      Italian accent, still holding to his nose his bottle of camphor, &ldquo;have
      any choleraic symptoms returned?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord; the pernicious fever, which succeeded the attack of
      cholera, still continues.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. But will not the reverend father be reasonable? What was
      the noise that I just heard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His reverence wished absolutely to get up and dress himself; but
      his weakness is so great, that he could not have taken two steps from the
      bed. He is devoured by impatience, and we fear that this agitation will
      cause a mortal relapse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Dr. Baleinier been here this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just left, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he think of the patient?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He finds him in the most alarming state, my lord. The night was so
      bad, that he was extremely uneasy this morning. Father Rodin is at one of
      those critical junctures, when a few hours may decide the life or death of
      the patient. Dr. Baleinier is now gone to fetch what is necessary for a
      very painful operation, which he is about to perform on the reverend
      father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny been told of this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny is himself very unwell, as your eminence
      knows; he has not been able to leave his bed for the last three days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inquired about him as I came up,&rdquo; answered the prelate,
      &ldquo;and I shall see him directly. But, to return to Father Rodin, have
      you sent for his confessor, since he is in a desperate state, and about to
      undergo a serious operation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Baleinier spoke a word to him about it, as well as about the
      last sacraments; but Father Rodin exclaimed, with great irritation, that
      they did not leave him a moment&rsquo;s peace, that he had as much care as
      any one for his salvation, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Per Bacco! I am not thinking of him,&rdquo; cried the cardinal,
      interrupting Ange Modeste Rousselet with his pagan oath, and raising his
      sharp voice to a still higher key; &ldquo;I am not thinking of him, but of
      the interests of the Company. It is indispensable that the reverend father
      should receive the sacraments with the most splendid solemnity, and that
      his end should not only be Christian, but exemplary. All the people in the
      house, and even strangers, should be invited to the spectacle, so that his
      edifying death may produce an excellent sensation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Fathers Grison and Brunet have already endeavored to
      persuade his reverence, my lord; but your Eminence knows with what
      impatience Father Rodin received this advice, and Dr. Baleinier did not
      venture to persist, for fear of advancing a fatal crisis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will venture to do it; for in these times of revolutionary
      impiety, a solemnly Christian death would produce a very salutary effect
      on the public. It would indeed be proper to make the necessary
      preparations to embalm the reverend father: he might then lie in state for
      some days, with lighted tapers, according to Romish custom. My secretary
      would furnish the design for the bier; it would be very splendid and
      imposing; from his position in the Order, Father Rodin is entitled to have
      everything in the most sumptuous style. He must have at least six hundred
      tapers, and a dozen funeral lamps, burning spirits of wine, to hang just
      over the body, and light it from above: the effect would be excellent. We
      must also distribute little tracts to the people, concerning the pious and
      ascetic life of his reverence&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a sudden noise, like that of some piece of metal thrown angrily on
      the floor, was heard from the next room, in which was the sick man, and
      interrupted the prelate in his description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Father Rodin has not heard you talk of embalming him, my
      lord,&rdquo; said Rousselet, in a whisper: &ldquo;his bed touches the
      partition, and almost everything is audible through it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Father Rodin has heard me,&rdquo; answered the cardinal, sinking
      his voice, and retiring to the other end of the room, &ldquo;this
      circumstance will enable me to enter at once on the business; but, in any
      case, I persist in believing that the embalming and the lying in state are
      required to make a good effect upon the public. The people are already
      frightened at the cholera, and such funeral pomp would have no small
      influence on the imagination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would venture to observe to your Eminence, that here the laws are
      opposed to such exhibitions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The laws&mdash;already the laws!&rdquo; said the cardinal, angrily;
      &ldquo;has not Rome also her laws? And is not every priest a subject of
      Rome? Is it not time&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, not choosing, doubtless, to begin a more explicit conversation with
      the young doctor, the prelate resumed, &ldquo;We will talk of this
      hereafter. But, tell me, since my last visit, has the reverend father had
      any fresh attacks of delirium?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord; here is the note, as your Eminence commanded.&rdquo;
      So saying Rousselet delivered a paper to the prelate. We will inform the
      reader that this part of the conversation between Rousselet and the
      cardinal was carried on at a distance from the partition, so that Rodin
      could hear nothing of it, whilst that which related to the embalming had
      been perfectly audible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal, having received the note from Rousselet, perused it with an
      expression of lively curiosity. When he had finished, he crumpled it in
      his hand, and said, without attempting to dissemble his vexation, &ldquo;Always
      nothing but incoherent expression. Not two words together, from which you
      can draw any reasonable conclusion. One would really think this man had
      the power to control himself even in his delirium, and to rave about
      insignificant matters only.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing Rousselet, &ldquo;You are sure that you have reported
      everything that escaped from him during his delirium?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the exception of the same phrases, that he repeated over and
      over again, your Eminence may be assured that I have not omitted a single
      word, however unmeaning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me into Father Rodin&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said the prelate,
      after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my lord,&rdquo; answered the young doctor, with some
      hesitation, &ldquo;the fit has only left him about an hour, and the
      reverend father is still very weak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more the reason,&rdquo; replied the prelate, somewhat
      indiscreetly. Then, recollecting himself, he added, &ldquo;He will the
      better appreciate the consolations I have to offer. Should he be asleep,
      awake him, and announce my visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only orders to receive from your Eminence,&rdquo; said
      Rousselet, bowing, and entering the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, the cardinal said to himself, with a pensive air, &ldquo;I
      always come back to that. When he was suddenly attacked by the cholera,
      Father Rodin believed himself poisoned by order of the Holy See. He must
      then have been plotting something very formidable against Rome, to
      entertain so abominable a fear. Can our suspicions be well founded? Is he
      acting secretly and powerfully on the Sacred College? But then for what
      end? This it has been impossible to penetrate, so faithfully has the
      secret been kept by his accomplices. I had hoped that, during his
      delirium, he would let slip some word that would put us on the trace of
      what we are so much interested to discover. With so restless and active a
      mind, delirium is often the exaggeration of some dominant idea; yet here I
      have the report of five different fits&mdash;and nothing&mdash;no, nothing
      but vague, unconnected phrases.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of Rousselet put an end to these reflections. &ldquo;I am sorry
      to inform my lord that the reverend father obstinately refuses to see any
      one. He says that he requires absolute repose. Though very weak, he has a
      savage and angry look, and I should not be surprised if he overheard your
      Eminence talk about embalming him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal, interrupting Rousselet, said to him, &ldquo;Did Father Rodin
      have his last fit of delirium in the night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between three and half-past five this morning, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between three and half-past five,&rdquo; repeated the prelate, as
      if he wished to impress this circumstance on his memory, &ldquo;the attack
      presented no particular symptoms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord; it consisted of rambling, incoherent talk, as your
      Eminence may see by this note.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he perceived the prelate approaching Father Rodin&rsquo;s door,
      Rousselet added, &ldquo;The reverend father will positively see no one, my
      lord; he requires rest, to prepare for the operation; it might be
      dangerous&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without attending to these observations, the cardinal entered Rodin&rsquo;s
      chamber. It was a tolerably large room, lighted by two windows, and simply
      but commodiously furnished. Two logs were burning slowly in the fireplace,
      in which stood a coffee-pot, a vessel containing mustard poultice, etc. On
      the chimney-piece were several pieces of rag, and some linen bandages. The
      room was full of that faint chemical odor peculiar to the chambers of the
      sick, mingled with so putrid a stench, that the cardinal stopped at the
      door a moment, before he ventured to advance further. As the three
      reverend fathers had mentioned in their walk, Rodin lived because he had
      said to himself, &ldquo;I want to live, and I will live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as men of timid imaginations and cowardly minds often die from the
      mere dread of dying, so a thousand facts prove that vigor of character and
      moral energy may often struggle successfully against disease, and triumph
      over the most desperate symptoms.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30117.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It was thus with the Jesuit. The unshaken firmness of his character, the
      formidable tenacity of his will (for the will has sometimes a mysterious
      and almost terrific power), aiding the skillful treatment of Dr.
      Baleinier, had saved him from the pestilence with which he had been so
      suddenly attacked. But the shock had been succeeded by a violent fever,
      which placed Rodin&rsquo;s life in the utmost peril. This increased danger
      had caused the greatest alarm to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who felt, in
      spite of his rivalry and jealousy, that Rodin was the master-spirit of the
      plot in which they were engaged, and could alone conduct it to a
      successful issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains of the room was half closed, and admitted only a doubtful
      light to the bed on which Rodin was lying. The Jesuit&rsquo;s features had
      lost the greenish hue peculiar to cholera patients, but remained perfectly
      livid and cadaverous, and so thin, that the dry, rugged skin appeared to
      cling to the smallest prominence of bone. The muscles and veins of the
      long, lean, vulture-like neck resembled a bundle of cords. The head,
      covered with an old, black, filthy nightcap, from beneath which strayed a
      few thin, gray hairs, rested upon a dirty pillow; for Rodin would not
      allow them to change his linen. His iron-gray beard had not been shaved
      for some time, and stood out like the hairs of a brush. Under his shirt he
      wore an old flannel waistcoat full of holes. He had one of his arms out of
      bed, and his bony hairy hand, with its bluish nails, held fast a cotton
      handkerchief of indescribable color.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might have taken him for a corpse, had it not been for the two
      brilliant sparks which still burned in the depths of his eyes. In that
      look, in which seemed concentrated all the remaining life and energy of
      the man, you might read the most restless anxiety. Sometimes his features
      revealed the sharpest pangs; sometimes the twisting of his hands, and his
      sudden starts, proclaimed his despair at being thus fettered to a bed of
      pain, whilst the serious interests which he had in charge required all the
      activity of his mind. Thus, with thoughts continually on the stretch, his
      mind often wandered, and he had fits of delirium, from which he woke as
      from a painful dream. By the prudent advice of Dr. Baleinier, who
      considered him not in a state to attend to matters of&mdash;importance,
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had hitherto evaded Rodin&rsquo;s questions with
      regard to the Rennepont affair, which he dreaded to see lost and ruined in
      consequence of his forced inaction. The silence of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      on this head, and the ignorance in which they kept him, only augmented the
      sick man&rsquo;s exasperation. Such was the moral and physical state of
      Rodin, when Cardinal Malipieri entered his chamber against his will.

      CHAPTER XXVII. THE LURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o understand fully
      the tortures of Rodin, reduced to inactivity by sickness, and to explain
      the importance of Cardinal Malipieri&rsquo;s visit, we must remember the
      audacious views of the ambitious Jesuit, who believed himself following in
      the steps of Sixtus V., and expected to become his equal. By the success
      of the Rennepont affair, to attain to the generalship of his Order, by the
      corruption of the Sacred College to ascend the pontifical throne, and
      then, by means of a change in the statutes of the Company, to incorporate
      the Society of Jesus with the Holy See, instead of leaving it independent,
      to equal and almost always rule the Papacy&mdash;such were the secret
      projects of Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their possibility was sanctioned by numerous precedents, for many mere
      monks and priests had been suddenly raised to the pontifical dignity. And
      as for their morality, the accession of the Borgias, of Julius II., and
      other dubious Vicars of Christ, might excuse and authorize the pretensions
      of the Jesuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the object of his secret intrigues at Rome had hitherto been
      enveloped in the greatest mystery, suspicions had been excited in regard
      to his private communications with many members of the Sacred College. A
      portion of that college, Cardinal Malipieri at the head of them, had
      become very uneasy on the subject, and, profiting by his journey to
      France, the cardinal had resolved to penetrate the Jesuit&rsquo;s dark
      designs. If, in the scene we have just painted, the cardinal showed
      himself so obstinately bent on having a conference with Rodin, in spite of
      the refusal of the latter, it was because the prelate hoped, as we shall
      soon see, to get by cunning at the secret, which had hitherto been so well
      concealed. It was, therefore, in the midst of all these extraordinary
      circumstances, that Rodin saw himself the victim of a malady, which
      paralyzed his strength, at the moment when he had need of all his
      activity, and of all the resources of his mind. After remaining for some
      seconds motionless near the door, the cardinal, still holding his bottle
      under his nose, slowly approached the bed where Rodin lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, enraged at this perseverance, and wishing to avoid an
      interview which for many reasons was singularly odious to him, turned his
      face towards the wall, and pretended to be asleep. Caring little for this
      feint, and determined to profit by Rodin&rsquo;s state of weakness, the
      prelate took a chair, and, conquering his repugnance, sat down close to
      the Jesuit&rsquo;s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reverend and very dear father, how do you find yourself?&rdquo;
      said he to him, in a honeyed tone, which his Italian accent seemed to
      render still more hypocritical. Rodin pretended not to hear, breathed
      hard, and made no answer. But the cardinal, not without disgust, shook
      with his gloved hand the arm of the Jesuit, and repeated in a louder
      voice: &ldquo;My reverend and very dear father, answer me, I conjure you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin could not restrain a movement of angry impatience, but he continued
      silent. The cardinal was not a man to be discouraged by so little; he
      again shook the arm of the Jesuit, somewhat more roughly, repeating, with
      a passionless tenacity that would have incensed the most patient person in
      the world: &ldquo;My reverend and very dear father, since you are not
      asleep, listen to me, I entreat of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritable with pain, exasperated by the obstinacy of the prelate, Rodin
      abruptly turned his head, fixed on the Roman his hollow eyes, shining with
      lurid fire, and, with lips contracted by a sardonic smile, said to him,
      bitterly: &ldquo;You must be very anxious, my lord, to see me embalmed,
      and lie in state with tapers, as you were saying just now, for you thus to
      come to torment me in my last moments, and hasten my end!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good father! how can you talk so?&rdquo; cried the cardinal,
      raising his hands as if to call heaven to witness to the sincerity of the
      tender interest he felt for the Jesuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that I heard all just now, my lord; for the partition is
      thin,&rdquo; added Rodin, with redoubled bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean that, from the bottom of my soul, I desired that you
      should make an exemplary and Christian end, you are perfectly right, my
      dear father. I did say so; for, after a life so well employed, it would be
      sweet to see you an object of adoration for the faithful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, my lord,&rdquo; cried Rodin, in a weak and broken
      voice, &ldquo;that it is ferocious to express such wishes in the presence
      of a dying man. Yes,&rdquo; he added, with growing animation, that
      contrasted strongly with his weakness, &ldquo;take care what you do; for
      if I am too much plagued and pestered&mdash;if I am not allowed to breathe
      my last breath quietly&mdash;I give you notice that you will force me to
      die in anything but a Christian manner, and if you mean to profit by an
      edifying spectacle, you will be deceived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This burst of anger having greatly fatigued Rodin, his head fell back upon
      the pillow, and he wiped his cracked and bleeding lips with his old cotton
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, be calm, my very dear father,&rdquo; resumed the
      cardinal, with a patronizing air; &ldquo;do not give way to such gloomy
      ideas. Doubtless, Providence reserves you for great designs, since you
      have been already delivered from so much peril. Let us hope that you will
      be likewise saved from your present danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin answered by a hoarse growl, and turned his face towards the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperturbable prelate continued: &ldquo;The views of Providence are
      not confined to your salvation, my very dear father. Its power has been
      manifested in another way. What I am about to tell you is of the highest
      importance. Listen attentively.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without turning his head, Rodin muttered in a tone of angry bitterness,
      which betrayed his intense sufferings: &ldquo;They desire my death. My
      chest is on fire, my head racked with pain, and they have no pity. Oh, I
      suffer the tortures of the damned!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! already&rdquo; thought the Roman, with a smile of sarcastic
      malice; then he said aloud: &ldquo;Let me persuade you, my very dear
      father&mdash;make an effort to listen to me; you will not regret it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still stretched upon the bed, Rodin lifted his hands clasped upon his
      cotton handkerchief with a gesture of despair, and then let them fall
      again by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal slightly shrugged his shoulders, and laid great stress on
      what follows, so that Rodin might not lose a word of it: &ldquo;My dear
      father, it has pleased Providence that, during your fit of raving, you
      have made, without knowing it, the most important revelations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prelate waited with anxious curiosity for the effect of the pious trap
      he had laid for the Jesuit&rsquo;s weakened faculties. But the latter,
      still turned towards the wall, did not appear to have heard him and
      remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, no doubt, reflecting on my words, my dear father,&rdquo;
      resumed the cardinal; &ldquo;you are right, for it concerns a very serious
      affair. I repeat to you that Providence has allowed you, during your
      delirium, to betray your most secret thoughts&mdash;happily, to me alone.
      They are such as would compromise you in the highest degree. In short,
      during your delirium of last night, which lasted nearly two hours, you
      unveiled the secret objects of your intrigues at Rome with many of the
      members of the Sacred College.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal, rising softly, stooped over the bed to watch the expression
      of Rodin&rsquo;s countenance. But the latter did not give him time. As a
      galvanized corpse starts into strange and sudden motion, Rodin sprang into
      a sitting posture at the last words of the prelate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has betrayed himself,&rdquo; said the cardinal, in a low voice,
      in Italian. Then, resuming his seat, he fixed on the Jesuit his eyes, that
      sparkled with triumphant joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he did not hear the exclamation of Malipieri, nor remark the
      expression of his countenance, Rodin, notwithstanding his state of
      weakness, instantly felt the imprudence of his start. He pressed his hand
      to his forehead, as though he had been seized with a giddiness; then,
      looking wildly round him, he pressed to his trembling lips his old cotton
      handkerchief, and gnawed it mechanically for some seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your emotion and alarm confirm the sad discoveries I have made,&rdquo;
      resumed the cardinal, still more rejoicing at the success of his trick;
      &ldquo;and now, my dear father,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;you will
      understand that it is for your best interest to enter into the most minute
      detail as to your projects and accomplices at Rome. You may then hope, my
      dear father, for the indulgence of the Holy See&mdash;that is, if your
      avowals are sufficiently explicit to fill up the chasms necessarily left
      in a confession made during delirium.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, recovered from his first surprise, perceived, but too late, that he
      had fallen into a snare, not by any words he had spoken, but by his too
      significant movements. In fact, the Jesuit had feared for a moment that he
      might have betrayed himself during his delirium, when he heard himself
      accused of dark intrigues with Rome; but, after some minutes of
      reflection, his common sense suggested: &ldquo;If this crafty Roman knew
      my secret, he would take care not to tell me so. He has only suspicions,
      confirmed by my involuntary start just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin wiped the cold sweat from his burning forehead. The emotion of this
      scene augmented his sufferings, and aggravated the danger of his
      condition. Worn out with fatigue, he could not remain long in a sitting
      posture, and soon fell back upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Per Bacco!&rdquo; said the cardinal to himself, alarmed at the
      expression of the Jesuit&rsquo;s face; &ldquo;if he were to die before he
      had spoken, and so escape the snare!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, leaning over the bed, the prelate asked: &ldquo;What is the matter,
      my very dear father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am weak, my lord&mdash;I am in pain&mdash;I cannot express what I
      suffer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope, my very dear father, that this crisis will have no
      fatal results; but the contrary may happen, and it behooves the salvation
      of your soul to make instantly the fullest confession. Were it even to
      exhaust your strength, what is this perishable body compared to eternal
      life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what confession do you speak, my lord?&rdquo; said Rodin, in a
      feeble and yet sarcastic tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What confession!&rdquo; cried the amazed cardinal; &ldquo;why, with
      regard to your dangerous intrigues at Rome.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What intrigues?&rdquo; asked Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The intrigues you revealed during your delirium,&rdquo; replied the
      prelate, with still more angry impatience. &ldquo;Were not your avowals
      sufficiently explicit? Why, then, this culpable hesitation to complete
      them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My avowals&mdash;were explicit&mdash;you assure me?&rdquo; said
      Rodin, pausing after each word for want of breath, but without losing his
      energy and presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I repeat it,&rdquo; resumed the cardinal; &ldquo;with the
      exception of a few chasms, they were most explicit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why repeat them?&rdquo; said Rodin, with the same sardonic
      smile on his violet lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why repeat them?&rdquo; cried the angry prelate. &ldquo;In order to
      gain pardon; for if there is indulgence and mercy for the repentant
      sinner, there must be condemnation and curses for the hardened criminal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what torture! I am dying by slow fire!&rdquo; murmured Rodin.
      &ldquo;Since I have told all,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I have nothing
      more to tell. You know it already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all&mdash;doubtless, I know all,&rdquo; replied the prelate,
      in a voice of thunder; &ldquo;but how have I learned it? By confessions
      made in a state of unconsciousness. Do you think they will avail you
      anything? No; the moment is solemn&mdash;death is at hand, tremble to die
      with a sacrilegious falsehood on your lips,&rdquo; cried the prelate,
      shaking Rodin violently by the arm; &ldquo;dread the eternal flames, if
      you dare deny what you know to be the truth. Do you deny it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny nothing,&rdquo; murmured Rodin, with difficulty. &ldquo;Only
      leave me alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then heaven inspires you,&rdquo; said the cardinal, with a sigh of
      satisfaction; and, thinking he had nearly attained his object, he resumed,
      &ldquo;Listen to the divine word, that will guide you, father. You deny
      nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was&mdash;delirious&mdash;and cannot&mdash;(oh! how I suffer!)&rdquo;
      added Rodin, by way of parenthesis; &ldquo;and cannot therefore&mdash;deny&mdash;the
      nonsense&mdash;I may have uttered!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when this nonsense agrees with the truth,&rdquo; cried the
      prelate, furious at being again deceived in his expectation; &ldquo;but
      when raving is an involuntary, providential revelation&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardinal Malipieri&mdash;your craft is no match&mdash;for my agony,&rdquo;
      answered Rodin, in a failing voice. &ldquo;The proof&mdash;that I have not
      told my secret&mdash;if I have a secret&mdash;is&mdash;that you want to
      make me tell it!&rdquo; In spite of his pain and weakness, the Jesuit had
      courage to raise himself in the bed, and look the cardinal full in the
      face, with a smile of bitter irony. After which he fell back on the
      pillow, and pressed his hands to his chest, with a long sigh of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation! the infernal Jesuit has found me out!&rdquo; said the
      cardinal to himself, as he stamped his foot with rage. &ldquo;He sees that
      he was compromised by his first movement; he is now upon his guard; I
      shall get nothing more from him&mdash;unless indeed, profiting by the
      state of weakness in which he is, I can, by entreaties, by threats, by
      terror&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prelate was unable to finish. The door opened abruptly, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      entered the room, exclaiming with an explosion of joy: &ldquo;Excellent
      news!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. GOOD NEWS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>y the alteration
      in the countenance of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, his pale cheek, and the
      feebleness of his walk, one might see that the terrible scene in the
      square of Notre-Dame, had violently reacted upon his health. Yet his face
      was radiant and triumphant, as he entered Rodin&rsquo;s chamber,
      exclaiming: &ldquo;Excellent news!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, Rodin started. In spite of his weakness, he raised his
      head, and his eyes shone with a curious, uneasy, piercing expression. With
      his lean hand, he beckoned Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to approach the bed,
      and said to him, in a broken voice, so weak that it was scarcely audible:
      &ldquo;I am very ill&mdash;the cardinal has nearly finished me&mdash;but
      if this excellent news&mdash;relates to the Rennepont affair&mdash;of
      which I hear nothing&mdash;it might save me yet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be saved then!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, forgetting the
      recommendations of Dr. Baleinier; &ldquo;read, rejoice! What you foretold
      is beginning to be realized!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he drew a paper from his pocket, and delivered it to Rodin, who
      seized it with an eager and trembling hand. Some minutes before, Rodin
      would have been really incapable of continuing his conversation with the
      cardinal, even if prudence had allowed him to do so; nor could he have
      read a single line, so dim had his sight become. But, at the words of
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, he felt such a renewal of hope and vigor, that,
      by a mighty effort of energy and will, he rose to a sitting posture, and,
      with clear head, and look of intelligent animation, he read rapidly the
      paper that Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had just delivered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal, amazed at this sudden transfiguration, asked himself if he
      beheld the same man, who, a few minutes before, had fallen back on his
      bed, almost insensible. Hardly had Rodin finished reading, than he uttered
      a cry of stifled joy, saying, with an accent impossible to describe:
      &ldquo;ONE gone! it works&mdash;&lsquo;tis well!&rdquo; And, closing his
      eyes in a kind of ecstatic transport, a smile of proud triumph overspread
      his face, and rendered him still more hideous, by discovering his yellow
      and gumless teeth. His emotion was so violent, that the paper fell from
      his trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has fainted,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with
      uneasiness, as he leaned over Rodin. &ldquo;It is my fault, I forgot that
      the doctor cautioned me not to talk to him of serious matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; do not reproach yourself,&rdquo; said Rodin, in a low voice,
      half-raising himself in the bed. &ldquo;This unexpected joy may perhaps
      cure me. Yes&mdash;I scarce know what I feel&mdash;but look at my cheeks&mdash;it
      seems to me, that, for the first time since I have been stretched on this
      bed of pain, they are a little warm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin spoke the truth. A slight color appeared suddenly on his livid and
      icy cheeks; his voice though still very weak, became less tremulous, and
      he exclaimed, in a tone of conviction that startled Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and the prelate, &ldquo;This first success answers for the others. I read
      the future. Yes, yes; our cause will triumph. Every member of the
      execrable Rennepont family will be crushed&mdash;and that soon you will
      see&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, pausing, Rodin threw himself back on the pillow, exclaiming: &ldquo;Oh!
      I am choked with joy. My voice fails me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; asked the cardinal of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter replied, in a tone of hypocritical sanctity: &ldquo;One of the
      heirs of the Rennepont family, a poor fellow, worn out with excesses and
      debauchery, died three days ago, at the close of some abominable orgies,
      in which he had braved the cholera with sacrilegious impiety. In
      consequence of the indisposition that kept me at home, and of another
      circumstance, I only received to-day the certificate of the death of this
      victim of intemperance and irreligion. I must proclaim it to the praise of
      his reverence&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to Rodin&mdash;&ldquo;that he told me,
      the worst enemies of the descendants of that infamous renegade would be
      their own bad passions, and that the might look to them as our allies
      against the whole impious race. And so it has happened with Jacques
      Rennepont.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Rodin, in so faint a voice that it was almost
      unintelligible, &ldquo;the punishment begins already. One of the
      Renneponts is dead&mdash;and believe me&mdash;this certificate,&rdquo; and
      he pointed to the paper that Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny held in his hand,
      &ldquo;will one day be worth forty millions to the Society of Jesus&mdash;and
      that&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lips alone finished the sentence. During some seconds, Rodin&rsquo;s
      voice had become so faint, that it was at last quite imperceptible. His
      larynx, contracted by violent emotion, no longer emitted any sound. The
      Jesuit, far from being disconcerted by this incident, finished his phrase,
      as it were, by expressive pantomime. Raising his head proudly he tapped
      his forehead with his forefinger, as if to express that it was to his
      ability this first success was owing. But he soon fell back again on the
      bed, exhausted, breathless, sinking, with his cotton handkerchief pressed
      once more to his parched lips. The good news, as Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      called it, had not cured Rodin. For a moment only, he had had the courage
      to forget his pain. But the slight color on his cheek soon disappeared;
      his face became once more livid. His sufferings, suspended for a moment,
      were so much increased in violence, that he writhed beneath the coverlet,
      and buried his face in the pillow, extending his arms above his head, and
      holding them stiff as bars of iron. After this crisis, intense as it was
      rapid: during which Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and the prelate bent anxiously
      over him, Rodin, whose face was bathed in cold sweat, made a sign that he
      suffered less, and that he wished to drink of a potion to which he
      pointed. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny fetched it for him, and while the
      cardinal held him up with marked disgust, the abbe administered a few
      spoonfuls of the potion, which almost immediately produced a soothing
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call M. Rousselet?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      when Rodin was once more laid down in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin shook his head; then, with a fresh effort, he raised his right hand,
      opened it, and pointed with his forefinger to a desk in a corner of the
      room, to signify that, being no longer able to speak, he wished to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your reverence,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;but first calm yourself. Presently, if you require it. I will give
      you writing materials.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two knocks at the outer door of the next room interrupted this scene. From
      motives of prudence, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had begged Rousselet to
      remain in the first of the three rooms. He now went to open the door, and
      Rousselet handed him a voluminous packet, saying: &ldquo;I beg pardon for
      disturbing you, father, but I was told to let you have these papers
      instantly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, M. Rousselet,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;do you know at what hour Dr. Baleinier will return?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not be long, father, for he wishes to perform before night
      the painful operation, that will have a decisive effect on the condition
      of Father Rodin. I am preparing what is necessary for it,&rdquo; added
      Rousselet, as he pointed to a singular and formidable apparatus, which
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny examined with a kind of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know if the symptom is a serious one,&rdquo; said the
      Jesuit; &ldquo;but the reverend father has suddenly lost his voice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the third time this has happened within the last week,&rdquo;
      said Rousselet; &ldquo;the operation of Dr. Baleiner will act both on the
      larynx and on the lungs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the operation a very painful one?&rdquo; asked Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, perhaps, none more cruel in surgery,&rdquo; answered the
      young doctor; &ldquo;and Dr. Baleinier has partly concealed its nature
      from Father Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to wait here for Dr. Baleinier, and send him to us as soon
      as he arrives,&rdquo; resumed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: and, returning to
      the sick chamber, he sat down by the bedside, and said to Rodin, as he
      showed him the letter: &ldquo;Here are different reports with regard to
      different members of the Rennepont family, whom I have had looked after by
      others, my indisposition having kept me at home for the last few days. I
      do not know, father, if the state of your health will permit you to hear&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin made a gesture, at once so supplicating and peremptory, that Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny felt there would be at least as much danger in refusing
      as in granting his request; so, turning towards the cardinal, still
      inconsolable at not having discovered the Jesuit&rsquo;s secret, he said
      to him with respectful deference, pointing at the same time to the letter:
      &ldquo;Have I the permission of your Eminence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prelate bowed, and replied: &ldquo;Your affairs are ours, my dear
      father. The Church must always rejoice in what rejoices your glorious
      Company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny unsealed the packet, and found in it different
      notes in different handwritings. When he had read the first, his
      countenance darkened, and he said, in a grave tone: &ldquo;A misfortune&mdash;a
      great misfortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin turned his head abruptly, and looked at him with an air of uneasy
      questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine is dead of the cholera,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny;
      &ldquo;and what is the worst,&rdquo; added he, crumpling the note between
      his hands, &ldquo;before dying, the miserable creature confessed to Mdlle.
      de Cardoville that she long acted as a spy under the orders of your
      reverence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the death of Florine, and the confession she had made, crossed
      some of the plans of Rodin, for he uttered an inarticulate murmur, and his
      countenance expressed great vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing to another note, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny continued: &ldquo;This
      relates to Marshal Simon, and is not absolutely bad, but still far from
      satisfactory, as it announces some amelioration in his position. We shall
      see if it merits belief, by information from another source.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin made a sign of impatience, to hasten Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to read
      the note, which he did as follows. &ldquo;&lsquo;For some days, the mind
      of the marshal has appeared to be less sorrowful, anxious and agitated. He
      lately passed two hours with his daughters, which had not been the case
      for some time before. The harsh countenance of the soldier Dagobert is
      becoming smoother&mdash;a sure sign of some amelioration in the condition
      of the marshal. Detected by their handwriting, the last anonymous letters
      were returned by Dagobert to the postman, without having been opened by
      the marshal. Some other method must be found to get them delivered.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at Rodin, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny said to him: &ldquo;Your
      reverence thinks with me that this note is not very satisfactory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin held down his head. One saw by the expression of his countenance how
      much he suffered by not being able to speak. Twice he put his hand to his
      throat, and looked at Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, angrily, when he had
      perused another note, &ldquo;for one lucky chance, to-day brings some very
      black ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words turning hastily to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and extending
      his trembling hands, Rodin questioned him with look and gesture. The
      cardinal, sharing his uneasiness, exclaimed: &ldquo;What do you learn by
      this note, my dear father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought the residence of M. Hardy in our house completely
      unknown,&rdquo; replied Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;but we now fear
      that Agricola Baudoin has discovered the retreat of his old master, and
      that he has even communicated with him by letter, through a servant of the
      house. So,&rdquo; added the reverend father, angrily, &ldquo;during the
      three days that I have not been able to visit the pavilion, one of my
      servants must have been bought over. There is one of them, a man blind of
      one eye, whom I have always suspected&mdash;the wretch! But no: I will not
      yet believe this treachery. The consequences would be too deplorable; for
      I know how matters stand, and that such a correspondence might ruin
      everything. By awaking in M. Hardy memories with difficulty laid asleep,
      they might destroy in a single day all that has been done since he
      inhabits our house. Luckily, this note contains only doubts and fears; my
      other information will be more positive, and will not, I hope, confirm
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; said the cardinal, &ldquo;do not despair.
      The Lord will not abandon the good cause!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny seemed very little consoled by this assurance. He
      remained still and thoughtful, whilst Rodin writhed his head in a paroxysm
      of mute rage, as he reflected on this new check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us turn to the last note,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      after a moment of thoughtful silence. &ldquo;I have so much confidence in
      the person who sends it, that I cannot doubt the correctness of the
      information it contains. May it contradict the others!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In order not to break the chain of facts contained in this last note,
      which was to have so startling an effect on the actors in this scene, we
      shall leave it to the reader&rsquo;s imagination to supply the
      exclamations of surprise, hate, rage and fear of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      and the terrific pantomime of Rodin, during the perusal of this formidable
      document, the result of the observations of a faithful and secret agent of
      the reverend fathers. Comparing this note with the other information
      received, the results appeared more distressing to the reverend fathers.
      Thus Gabriel had long and frequent conferences with Adrienne, who before
      was unknown to him. Agricola Baudoin had opened a communication with
      Francis Hardy, and the officers of justice were on the track of the
      authors and instigators of the riot which had led to the burning of the
      factory of Baron Tripeaud&rsquo;s rival. It seemed almost certain that
      Mdlle. de Cardoville had had an interview with Prince Djalma.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30135.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This combination of facts showed that, faithful to the threats she had
      uttered to Rodin, when she had unmasked the double perfidy of the reverend
      father, Mdlle. de Cardoville was actively engaged in uniting the scattered
      members of her family, to form a league against those dangerous enemies,
      whose detestable projects, once unveiled and boldly encountered, could
      hardly have a chance of success. The reader will now understand the
      tremendous effect of this note on Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Rodin&mdash;on
      Rodin, stretched powerless on a bed of pain at the moment when the
      scaffolding, raised with so much labor, seemed to be tumbling around him.

      CHAPTER XXIX. THE OPERATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e have given up
      the attempt to paint the countenance, attitude, and gesticulation of Rodin
      during the reading of this note, which seemed to ruin all his most
      cherished hopes. Everything was failing at once, at the moment when only
      superhuman trust in the success of his plans could give him sufficient
      energy to strive against mortal sickness. A single, absorbing thought had
      agitated him even to delirium: What progress, during his illness, had been
      made in this immense affair? He had first heard a good piece of news, the
      death of Jacques Rennepont; but now the advantages of this decease, which
      reduced the number of the heirs from seven to six, were entirely lost. To
      what purpose would be this death, if the other members of the family,
      dispersed and persecuted with such infernal perseverance, were to unite
      and discover the enemies who had so long aimed at them in darkness? If all
      those wounded hearts were to console, enlighten, support each other, their
      cause would be gained, and the inheritance rescued from the reverend
      fathers. What was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange power of the human will!&mdash;Rodin had one foot in the grave, he
      was almost at the last gasp; his voice had failed him. And yet that
      obstinate nature, so full of energy and resources, did not despair. Let
      but a miracle restore his health, and that firm confidence in the success
      of his projects which has given him power to struggle against disease,
      tells him that he could yet save all&mdash;but then he must have health
      and life! Health! life! His physician does not know if he will survive the
      shock&mdash;if he can bear the pain&mdash;of a terrible operation. Health!
      life! and just now Rodin heard talk of the solemn funeral they had
      prepared for him. And yet&mdash;health, life, he will have them. Yes; he
      has willed to live&mdash;and he has lived&mdash;why should he not live
      longer? He will live&mdash;because he has willed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that we have just written passed though Rodin&rsquo;s mind in a
      second. His features, convulsed by the mental torment he endured, must
      have assumed a very strange expression, for Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and
      the cardinal looked at him in silent consternation. Once resolved to live,
      and to sustain a desperate struggle with the Rennepont family, Rodin acted
      in consequence. For a few moments Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and the prelate
      believed themselves under the influence of a dream. By an effort of
      unparalleled energy, and as if moved by hidden mechanism, Rodin sprang
      from the bed, dragging the sheet with him, and trailing it, like a shroud,
      behind his livid and fleshless body. The room was cold; the face of the
      Jesuit was bathed in sweat; his naked and bony feet left their moist print
      upon the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing? It is death!&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      rushing towards Rodin, to force him to lie down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the latter, extending one of his skeleton arms, as hard as iron,
      pushed aside Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny with inconceivable vigor, considering
      the state of exhaustion in which he had so long been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the strength of a man in a fit of epilepsy,&rdquo; said
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, recovering his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a steady step Rodin advanced to the desk on which Dr. Baleinier daily
      wrote his prescriptions. Seating himself before it, the Jesuit took pen
      and paper, and began to write in a firm hand. His calm, slow, and sure
      movements had in them something of the deliberateness remarked in
      somnambulists. Mute and motionless, hardly knowing whether they dreamed or
      not, the cardinal and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny remained staring at the
      incredible coolness of Rodin, who, half-naked, continued to write with
      perfect tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; said the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, advancing
      towards him, &ldquo;this is madness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin shrugged his shoulders, stopped him with a gesture and made him a
      sign to read what he had just written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend father expected to see the ravings of a diseased brain; but
      he took the note, whilst Rodin commenced another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;read
      this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal read the paper, and returning it to the reverend father with
      equal amazement, added: &ldquo;It is full of reason, ability, and
      resources. We shall thus be able to neutralize the dangerous combination
      of Abbe Gabriel and Mdlle. de Cardoville, who appear to be the most
      formidable leaders of the coalition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really miraculous,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear father!&rdquo; whispered the cardinal, shaking his
      head; &ldquo;what a pity that we are the only witnesses of this scene!
      What an excellent MIRACLE we could have made of it! In one sense, it is
      another Raising of Lazarus!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idea, my lord!&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in
      a low voice. &ldquo;It is perfect&mdash;and we must not give it up&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This innocent little plot was interrupted by Rodin, who, turning his head,
      made a sign to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny to approach, and delivered to him
      another sheet, with this note attached: &ldquo;To be executed within an
      hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having rapidly perused the paper, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny exclaimed:
      &ldquo;Right! I had not thought of that. Instead of being fatal, the
      correspondence between Agricola and M. Hardy may thus have the best
      results. Really,&rdquo; added the reverend father in a low voice to the
      prelate, while Rodin continued to write, &ldquo;I am quite confounded. I
      read&mdash;I see&mdash;and yet I can hardly believe my eyes. Just before,
      exhausted and dying&mdash;and now with his mind as clear and penetrating
      as ever. Can this be one of the phenomena of somnambulism, in which the
      mind alone governs and sustains the body?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opened, and Dr. Baleinier entered the room. At sight of
      Rodin, seated half-naked at the desk, with his feet upon the cold stones,
      the doctor exclaimed, in a tone of reproach and alarm: &ldquo;But, my lord&mdash;but,
      father&mdash;it is murder to let the unhappy man do this!&mdash;If he is
      delirious from fever, he must have the strait-waistcoat, and be tied down
      in bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying. Dr. Baleinier hastily approached Rodin, and took him by the
      arm. Instead of finding the skin dry and chilly, as he expected, he found
      it flexible, almost damp. Struck with surprise, the doctor sought to feel
      the pulse of the left hand, which Rodin resigned, to him, whilst he
      continued working with the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a prodigy!&rdquo; cried the doctor, as he counted Rodin&rsquo;s
      pulse; &ldquo;for a week past, and even this morning, the pulse has been
      abrupt, intermittent, almost insensible, and now it is firm, regular&mdash;I
      am really puzzled&mdash;what then has happened? I can hardly believe what
      I see,&rdquo; added the doctor, turning towards Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      and the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reverend father, who had first lost his voice, was next seized
      with such furious and violent despair caused by the receipt of bad news,&rdquo;
      answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;that we feared a moment for his
      life; while now, on the contrary, the reverend father has gained
      sufficient strength to go to his desk, and write for some minutes, with a
      clearness of argument and expression, which has confounded both the
      cardinal and myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no longer any doubt of it,&rdquo; cried the doctor.
      &ldquo;The violent despair has caused a degree of emotion, which will
      admirably prepare the reactive crisis, that I am now almost certain of
      producing by the operation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You persist in the operation?&rdquo; whispered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      whilst Rodin continued to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have hesitated this morning; but, disposed as he now is for
      it, I must profit by the moment of excitement, which will be followed by
      greater depression.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, without the operation&mdash;&rdquo; said the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fortunate and unexpected crisis will soon be over, and the
      reaction may kill him, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you informed him of the serious nature of the operation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nearly, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is time to bring him to the point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I will do, my lord,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier; and
      approaching Rodin, who continued to write, he thus addressed him, in a
      firm voice: &ldquo;My reverend father, do you wish to be up and well in a
      week?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin nodded, full of confidence, as much as to say: &ldquo;I am up
      already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not deceive yourself,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;This
      crisis is excellent, but it will not last, and if we would profit by it,
      we must proceed with the operation of which I have spoken to you&mdash;or,
      I tell you plainly, I answer for nothing after such a shock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin was the more struck with these words, as, half an hour ago, he had
      experienced the short duration of the improvement occasioned by Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&rsquo;s
      good news, and as already he felt increased oppression on the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Baleinier, wishing to decide him, added: &ldquo;In a word, father,
      will you live or die?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin wrote rapidly this answer, which he gave to the doctor: &ldquo;To
      live, I would let you cut me limb from limb. I am ready for anything.&rdquo;
      And he made a movement to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, reverend father, so as not to take you by
      surprise,&rdquo; added Dr. Baleinier, &ldquo;that this operation is
      cruelly painful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin shrugged his shoulders and wrote with a firm hand: &ldquo;Leave me
      my head; you may take all the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor read these words aloud, and the cardinal and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      looked at each other in admiration of this dauntless courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, &ldquo;you must lie
      down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin wrote: &ldquo;Get everything ready. I have still some orders to
      write. Let me know when it is time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then folding up a paper, which he had sealed with a wafer, Rodin gave
      these words to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny: &ldquo;Send this note instantly to
      the agent who addressed the anonymous letters to Marshal Simon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instantly, reverend father,&rdquo; replied the abbe; &ldquo;I will
      employ a sure messenger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; said Baleinier to Rodin, &ldquo;since you
      must write, lie down in bed, and write there, during our little
      preparations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin made an affirmative gesture, and rose. But already the prognostics
      of the doctor were realized. The Jesuit could hardly remain standing for a
      second; he fell back into a chair, and looked at Dr. Baleinier with
      anguish, whilst his breathing became more and more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said to him: &ldquo;Do not be uneasy. But we must make haste.
      Lean upon me and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aided by these two supporters, Rodin was able to regain the bed. Once
      there, he made signs that they should bring him pen, ink, and paper. Then
      he continued to write upon his knees, pausing from time to time, to
      breathe with great difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend father,&rdquo; said Baleinier to d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;are
      you capable of acting as one of my assistants in the operation? Have you
      that sort of courage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the reverend father; &ldquo;in the army I could
      never assist at an amputation. The sight of blood is too much for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no blood,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;but it will
      be worse. Please send me three of our reverend fathers to assist me, and
      ask M. Rousselet to bring in the apparatus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny went out. The prelate approached the doctor, and
      whispered, pointing to Rodin: &ldquo;Is he out of danger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he stands the operation&mdash;yes, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that he can stand it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him I should say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; to you &lsquo;I hope so.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were he to die, would there be time to administer the
      sacraments in public, with a certain pomp, which always causes some little
      delay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His dying may continue, my lord&mdash;a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is short, but we must be satisfied with that,&rdquo; said the
      prelate.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30141.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      And, going to one of the windows, he began to tap with his fingers on the
      glass, while he thought of the illumination effects, in the event of Rodin&rsquo;s
      lying in state. At this moment, Rousselet entered, with a large square box
      under his arm. He placed it on the drawers, and began to arrange his
      apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many have you prepared?&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four will do, but it is well to be fully provided. The cotton is
      not too thick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is the reverend father?&rdquo; asked the pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; answered the doctor, in a whisper. &ldquo;The chest
      is terribly clogged, the respiration hissing, the voice gone&mdash;still
      there is a change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my fear is, sir, that the reverend father will not be able to
      stand the dreadful pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is another chance; but, under the circumstances, we must risk
      all. Come, my dear boy, light the&mdash;taper; I hear our assistants.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny entered the room, accompanied by the
      three Jesuits, who, in the morning, had walked in the garden. The two old
      men, with their rosy cheeks, and the young one, with the ascetic
      countenance, all three dressed in black, with their square caps and white
      bands, appeared perfectly ready to assist Dr. Baleinier in his formidable
      operation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. THE TORTURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend fathers,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, graciously, to the
      three, &ldquo;I thank you for your kind aid. What you have to do is very
      simple, and, by the blessing of heaven, this operation will save the life
      of our dear Father Rodin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three black-gowns cast up their eyes piously, and then bowed
      altogether, like one man. Rodin, indifferent to what was passing around
      him, never ceased an instant to write or reflect. Nevertheless, in spite
      of his apparent calmness, he felt such difficulty in breathing, that more
      than once Dr. Baleinier had turned round uneasily, as he heard the stifled
      rattling in the throat of the sick man. Making a sign to his pupil, the
      doctor approached Rodin and said to him: &ldquo;Come, reverend father;
      this is the important moment. Courage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No sign of alarm was expressed in the Jesuit&rsquo;s countenance. His
      features remained impassible as those of a corpse. Only, his little
      reptile eyes sparkled still more brightly in their dark cavities. For a
      moment, he looked round at the spectators of this scene; then, taking his
      pen between his teeth, he folded and wafered another letter, placed it on
      the table beside the bed, and nodded to Dr. Baleinier, as if to say:
      &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take off your flannel waistcoat, and your shirt, father.&rdquo;
      Rodin hesitated an instant, and the doctor resumed: &ldquo;It is
      absolutely necessary, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aided by Baleinier, Rodin obeyed, whilst the doctor added, no doubt to
      spare his modesty: &ldquo;We shall only require the chest, right and left,
      my dear father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Rodin, stretched upon his back, with his dirty night-cap still on
      his head, exposed the upper part of a livid trunk, or rather, the bony
      cage of a skeleton, for the shadows of the ribs and cartilages encircled
      the skin with deep, black lines. As for the arms, they resembled bones
      twisted with cord and covered with tanned parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, M. Rousselet, the apparatus!&rdquo; said Baleinier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then addressing the three Jesuits, he added: &ldquo;Please draw near,
      gentlemen; what you have to do is very simple, as you will see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed very simple. The doctor gave to each of his four assistants
      a sort of little steel tripod about two inches in diameter and three in
      height; the circular centre of this tripod was filled with cotton; the
      instrument was held in the left hand by means of a wooden handle. In the
      right hand each assistant held a small tin tube about eighteen inches
      long; at one end was a mouthpiece to receive the lips of the operator, and
      the other spread out so as to form a cover to the little tripod. These
      preparations had nothing alarming in them. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and the
      prelate, who looked on from a little distance, could not understand how
      this operation should be so painful. They soon understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Baleinier, having thus provided his four assistants, made them
      approach Rodin, whose bed had been rolled into the middle of the room. Two
      of them were placed on one side, two on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier, &ldquo;set light to the
      cotton; place the lighted part on the skin of his reverence, by means of
      the tripod which contains the wick; cover the tripod with the broad part
      of the tube, and then blow through the other end to keep up the fire. It
      is very simple, as you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, full of the most patriarchal and primitive ingenuity.
      Four lighted cotton rocks, so disposed as to burn very slowly, were
      applied to the two sides of Rodin&rsquo;s chest. This is vulgarly called
      the moxa. The trick is done, when the whole thickness of the skin has been
      burnt slowly through. It lasts seven or eight minutes. They say that an
      amputation is nothing to it. Rodin had watched the preparations with
      intrepid curiosity. But, at the first touch of the four fires, he writhed
      like a serpent, without being able to utter a cry. Even the expression of
      pain was denied him. The four assistants being disturbed by, the sudden
      start of Rodin, it was necessary to begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, my dear father! offer these sufferings to the Lord!&rdquo;
      said Dr. Baleinier, in a sanctified tone. &ldquo;I told you the operation
      would be very painful; but then it is salutary in proportion. Come; you
      that have shown such decisive resolution, do not fail at the last
      movement!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin had closed his eyes, conquered by the first agony of pain. He now
      opened them, and looked at the doctor as if ashamed of such weakness. And
      yet on the sides of his chest were four large, bleeding wounds&mdash;so
      violent had been the first singe. As he again extended himself on the bed
      of torture, Rodin made a sign that he wished to write. The doctor gave him
      the pen, and he wrote as follows, by way of memorandum; &ldquo;It is
      better not to lose any time. Inform Baron Tripeaud of the warrant issued
      against Leonard, so that he may be on his guard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having written this note, the Jesuit gave it to Dr. Baleinier, to hand it
      to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who was as much amazed as the doctor and the
      cardinal, at such extraordinary presence of mind in the midst of such
      horrible pain. Rodin, with his eyes fixed on the reverend father, seemed
      to wait with impatience for him to leave the room to execute his orders.
      Guessing the thought of Rodin, the doctor whispered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      who went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, reverend father,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;we must begin
      again. This time do not move.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin did not answer, but clasped his hands over his head, closed his
      eyes, and presented his chest. It was a strange, lugubrious, almost
      fantastic spectacle. The three priests, in their long black gowns, leaned
      over this body, which almost resembled a corpse, and blowing through their
      tubes into the chest of the patient, seemed as if pumping up his blood by
      some magic charm. A sickening odor of burnt flesh began to spread through
      the silent chamber, and each assistant heard a slight crackling beneath
      the smoking trivet; it was the skin of Rodin giving way to the action of
      fire, and splitting open in four different parts of his chest. The sweat
      poured from his livid face, which it made to shine; a few locks of his
      gray hair stood up stiff and moist from his temples. Sometimes the spasms
      were so violent, that the veins swelled on his stiffened arms, and were
      stretched like cords ready to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enduring this frightful torture with as much intrepid resignation as the
      savage whose glory consists in despising pain, Rodin gathered his strength
      and courage from the hope&mdash;we had almost said the certainty&mdash;of
      life. Such was the make of this dauntless character, such the energy of
      this powerful mind, that, in the midst of indescribable torments, his one
      fixed idea never left him. During the rare intervals of suffering&mdash;for
      pain is equal even at this degree of intensity&mdash;Rodin still thought
      of the Rennepont inheritance, and calculated his chances, and combined his
      measures, feeling that he had not a minute to lose. Dr. Baleinier watched
      him with extreme attention, waiting for the effects of the reaction of
      pain upon the patient, who seemed already to breathe with less difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Rodin placed his hand on his forehead, as if struck with some new
      idea, and turning his head towards Dr. Baleinier, made a sign to him to
      suspend the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, reverend father,&rdquo; answered the doctor,
      &ldquo;that it is not half finished, and, if we leave off, the renewal
      will be more painful&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin made a sign that he did not care, and that he wanted to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, stop a moment,&rdquo; said Dr. Baleinier; &ldquo;keep
      down your moxas, but do not blow the fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the fire was to burn slowly, instead of fiercely, but still upon the
      skin of the patient. In spite of this pain, less intense, but still sharp
      and keen, Rodin, stretched upon his back, began to write, holding the
      paper above his head. On the first sheet he traced some alphabetic signs,
      part of a cipher known to himself alone. In the midst of the torture, a
      luminous idea had crossed his mind; fearful of forgetting it amidst his
      sufferings, he now took note of it. On another paper he wrote the
      following, which was instantly delivered to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
      &ldquo;Send B. immediately to Faringhea, for the report of the last few
      days with regard to Djalma, and let B. bring it hither on the instant.&rdquo;
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny went out to execute this new order. The cardinal
      approached a little nearer to the scene of the operation, for, in spite of
      the bad odor of the room, he took delight in seeing the Jesuit half
      roasted, having long cherished against him the rancor of an Italian and a
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, reverend father,&rdquo; said the doctor to Rodin, &ldquo;continue
      to be admirably courageous, and your chest will free itself. You have
      still a bitter moment to go through&mdash;and then I have good hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The patient resumed his former position. The moment Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      returned, Rodin questioned him with a look, to which the reverend father
      replied by a nod. At a sign from the doctor, the four assistants began to
      blow through the tubes with all their might. This increase of torture was
      so horrible, that, in spite of his self-control, Rodin gnashed his teeth,
      started convulsively, and so expanded his palpitating chest, that, after a
      violent spasm, there rose from his throat and lungs a scream of terrific
      pain&mdash;but it was free, loud, sonorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chest is free!&rdquo; cried the doctor, in triumph. &ldquo;The
      lungs have play&mdash;the voice returns&mdash;he is saved!&mdash;Blow,
      gentlemen, blow; and, reverend father, cry out as much as you please: I
      shall be delighted to hear you, for it will give you relief. Courage! I
      answer for the result. It is a wonderful cure. I will publish it by sound
      of trumpet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, doctor,&rdquo; whispered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, as he
      approached Dr. Baleinier; &ldquo;the cardinal can witness, that I claimed
      beforehand the publication of this affair&mdash;as a miraculous fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be miraculous then,&rdquo; answered Dr. Baleinier,
      disappointed&mdash;for he set some value on his own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing he was saved, Rodin though his sufferings were perhaps worse
      than ever, for the fire had now pierced the scarf-skin, assumed almost an
      infernal beauty. Through the painful contraction of his features shone the
      pride of savage triumph; the monster felt that he was becoming once more
      strong and powerful, and he seemed conscious the evils that his fatal
      resurrection was to cause. And so, of still writhing beneath the flames,
      he pronounced these words, the first that struggled from his chest:
      &ldquo;I told you I should live!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told us true,&rdquo; cried the doctor, feeling his pulse;
      &ldquo;the circulation is now full and regular, the lungs are free. The
      reaction is complete. You are saved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the last shreds of cotton had burnt out. The trivets were
      withdrawn, and on the skeleton trunk of Rodin were seen four large round
      blisters. The skin still smoked, and the raw flesh was visible beneath. In
      one of his sudden movements, a lamp had been misplaced, and one of these
      burns was larger than the other, presenting as it were to the eye a double
      circle. Rodin looked down upon his wounds. After some seconds of silent
      contemplation, a strange smile curled his lips. Without changing his
      position, he glanced at Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny with an expression
      impossible to describe, and said to him, as he slowly counted the wounds
      touching them with his flat and dirty nail: &ldquo;Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      what an omen!&mdash;Look here! one Rennepont&mdash;two Renneponts&mdash;three
      Renneponts&mdash;four Renneponts&mdash;where is then the fifth!&mdash;Ah!
      here&mdash;this wound will count for two. They are twins.&rdquo;(41) And he
      emitted a little dry, bitter laugh. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, the cardinal,
      and Dr. Baleinier, alone understood the sense of these mysterious and
      fatal words, which Rodin soon completed by a terrible allusion, as he
      exclaimed, with prophetic voice, and almost inspired air: &ldquo;Yes, I
      say it. The impious race will be reduced to ashes, like the fragments of
      this poor flesh. I say it, and it will be so. I said I would live&mdash;and
      I do live!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (41) Jacques Rennepont being dead, and Gabriel out of the field, in
      consequence of his donation, there remained only five persons of the
      family&mdash;Rose and Blanche, Djalma, Adrienne, and Hardy.

      CHAPTER XXXI. VICE AND VIRTUE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo days have
      elapsed since Rodin was miraculously restored to life. The reader will not
      have forgotten the house in the Rue Clovis, where the reverend father had
      an apartment, and where also was the lodging of Philemon, inhabited by
      Rose-Pompon. It is about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. A bright
      ray of light, penetrating through a round hole in the door Mother Arsene&rsquo;s
      subterraneous shop, forms a striking contrast with the darkness of this
      cavern. The ray streams full upon a melancholy object. In the midst of
      fagots and faded vegetables, and close to a great heap of charcoal, stands
      a wretched bed; beneath the sheet, which covers it, can be traced the
      stiff and angular proportions of a corpse. It is the body of Mother Arsene
      herself, who died two days before, of the cholera. The burials have been
      so numerous, that there has been no time to remove her remains. The Rue
      Clovis is almost deserted. A mournful silence reigns without, often broken
      by the sharp whistling of the north wind. Between the squalls, one hears a
      sort of pattering. It is the noise of the large rats, running to and fro
      across the heap of charcoal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, another sound is heard, and these unclean animals fly to hide
      themselves in their holes. Some one is trying to force open the door,
      which communicates between the shop and the passage. It offers but little
      resistance, and, in a few seconds, the worn-out lock gives way, and a
      woman enters. For a short time she stands motionless in the obscurity of
      the damp and icy cave. After a minute&rsquo;s hesitation, the woman
      advances and the ray of light illumines the features of the Bacchanal
      Queen. Slowly, she approached the funeral couch. Since the death of
      Jacques, the alteration in the countenance of Cephyse had gone on
      increasing. Fearfully pale, with her fine black hair in disorder, her legs
      and feet naked, she was barely covered with an old patched petticoat and a
      very ragged handkerchief.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

      <a href="images/30149.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When she came near the bed, she cast a glance of almost savage assurance
      at the shroud. Suddenly she drew back, with a low cry of involuntary
      terror. The sheet moved with a rapid undulation, extending from the feet
      to the head of the corpse. But soon the sight of a rat, flying along the
      side of the worm-eaten bedstead, explained the movement of the shroud.
      Recovering from her fright, Cephyse began to look for several things, and
      collected them in haste, as though she dreaded being surprised in the
      miserable shop. First, she seized a basket, and filled it with charcoal;
      then, looking from side to side, she discovered in a corner an earthen
      pot, which she took with a burst of ominous joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not all, it is not all,&rdquo; said Cephyse, as she continued
      to search with an unquiet air.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she perceived near the stove a little tin box, containing flint,
      steel and matches. She placed these articles on the top of the basket, and
      took it in one hand, and the earthen pot in the other. As she passed near
      the corpse of the poor charcoal-dealer, Cephyse said, with a strange
      smile: &ldquo;I rob you, poor Mother Arsene, but my theft will not do me
      much good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cephyse left the shop, reclosed the door as well as she could, went up the
      passage, and crossed the little court-yard which separated the front of
      the building from that part in which Rodin had lodged. With the exception
      of the windows of Philemon&rsquo;s apartment, where Rose-Pompon had so
      often sat perched like a bird, warbling Beranger, the other windows of the
      house were open. There had been deaths on the first and second floors,
      and, like many others, they were waiting for the cart piled up with
      coffins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacchanal Queen gained the stairs, which led to the chambers formerly
      occupied by Rodin. Arrived at the landing-place she ascended another
      ruinous staircase, steep as a ladder, and with nothing but an old rope for
      a rail. She at length reached the half-rotten door of a garret, situated
      in the roof. The house was in such a state of dilapidation, that, in many
      places the roof gave admission to the rain, and allowed it to penetrate
      into this cell, which was not above ten feet square, and lighted by an
      attic window. All the furniture consisted of an old straw mattress, laid
      upon the ground, with the straw peeping out from a rent in its ticking; a
      small earthenware pitcher, with the spout broken, and containing a little
      water, stood by the side of this couch. Dressed in rags, Mother Bunch was
      seated on the side of the mattress, with her elbows on her knees, and her
      face concealed in her thin, white hands. When Cephyse entered the room,
      the adopted sister of Agricola raised her head; her pale, mild face seemed
      thinner than ever, hollow with suffering, grief, misery; her eyes, red
      with weeping, were fixed on her sister with an expression of mournful
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have what we want, sister,&rdquo; said Cephyse, in a low, deep
      voice; &ldquo;in this basket there is wherewith to finish our misery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, showing to Mother Bunch the articles she had just placed on the
      floor, she added: &ldquo;For the first time in my life, I have been a
      thief. It made me ashamed and frightened; I was never intended for that or
      worse. It is a pity.&rdquo; added she, with a sardonic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, the hunchback said to her sister, in a
      heart rending tone: &ldquo;Cephyse&mdash;my dear Cephyse&mdash;are you
      quite determined to die?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I hesitate?&rdquo; answered Cephyse, in a firm voice.
      &ldquo;Come, sister, let us once more make our reckoning. If even I could
      forget my shame, and Jacques&rsquo; contempt in his last moments, what
      would remain to me? Two courses only: first, to be honest, and work for my
      living. But you know that, in spite of the best will in the world, work
      will often fail, as it has failed for the last few days, and, even when I
      got it, I would have to live on four to five francs a week. Live? that is
      to say, die by inches. I know that already, and I prefer dying at once.
      The other course would be to live a life of infamy&mdash;and that I will
      not do. Frankly, sister, between frightful misery, infamy, or death, can
      the choice be doubtful? Answer me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without giving Mother Bunch time to speak, Cephyse added, in an
      abrupt tone: &ldquo;Besides, what is the good of discussing it? I have
      made up my mind, and nothing shall prevent my purpose, since all that you,
      dear sister, could obtain from me, was a delay of a few days, to see if
      the cholera would not save us the trouble. To please you I consented; the
      cholera has come, killed every one else in the house, but left us. You
      see, it is better to do one&rsquo;s own business,&rdquo; added she, again
      smiling bitterly. Then she resumed: &ldquo;Besides, dear sister, you also
      wish to finish with life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, Cephyse,&rdquo; answered the sempstress, who seemed
      very much depressed; &ldquo;but alone&mdash;one has only to answer for one&rsquo;s
      self&mdash;and to die with you,&rdquo; added she, shuddering, &ldquo;appears
      like being an accomplice in your death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish, then, to make an end of it, I in one place, you in
      another?&mdash;that would be agreeable!&rdquo; said Cephyse, displaying in
      that terrible moment the sort of bitter and despairing irony which is more
      frequent than may be imagined in the midst of mortal anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; said the other in alarm, &ldquo;not alone&mdash;I
      will not die alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see, dear sister, we are right not to part? And yet,&rdquo;
      added Cephyse, in a voice of emotion, &ldquo;my heart almost breaks
      sometimes, to think that you will die like me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How selfish!&rdquo; said the hunchback, with a faint smile. &ldquo;What
      reasons have I to love life? What void shall I leave behind me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a martyr, sister,&rdquo; resumed Cephyse. &ldquo;The
      priests talk of saints! Is there one of them so good as you? And yet you
      are about to die like me, who have always been idle, careless, sinful&mdash;while
      you were so hardworking, so devoted to all who suffered. What should I
      say? You were an angel on the earth; and yet you will die like me, who
      have fallen as low as a woman can fall,&rdquo; added the unfortunate,
      casting down her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Starting
      from the same point, we have followed different roads, and yet we have
      reached the same goal&mdash;disgust of life. For you, my poor sister, but
      a few days ago, life was so fair, so full of pleasure and of youth; and
      now it is equally heavy with us both. After all, I have followed to the
      end what was my duty,&rdquo; added she, mildly. &ldquo;Agricola no longer
      needs me. He is married; he loves, and is beloved; his happiness is
      secured. Mdlle. de Cardoville wants for nothing. Fair, rich, prosperous&mdash;what
      could a poor creature like myself do for her? Those who have been kind to
      me are happy. What prevents my going now to my rest? I am so weary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor sister!&rdquo; said Cephyse, with touching emotion, which
      seemed to expand her contracted features; &ldquo;when I think that,
      without informing me, and in spite of your resolution never to see that
      generous young lady, who protected you, you yet had the courage to drag
      yourself to her house, dying with fatigue and want, to try to interest her
      in my fate&mdash;yes, dying, for your strength failed on the
      Champs-Elysees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I was able to reach the mansion, Mdlle. de Cardoville was
      unfortunately absent&mdash;very unfortunately!&rdquo; repeated the
      hunchback, as she looked at Cephyse with anguish; &ldquo;for the next day,
      seeing that our last resource had failed us, thinking more of me than of
      yourself, and determined at any price to procure us bread&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not finish. She buried her face in her hands, and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did as so many other hapless women have done when work
      fails or wages do not suffice, and hunger becomes too pressing,&rdquo;
      replied Cephyse, in a broken voice; &ldquo;only that, unlike so many
      others, instead of living on my shame, I shall die of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! this terrible shame which kills you, my poor Cephyse, because
      you have a heart, would have been averted, had I seen Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, or had she but answered the letter which I asked leave to
      write to her at the porter&rsquo;s lodge. But her silence proves to me
      that she is justly hurt at my abrupt departure from her house. I can
      understand it; she believes me guilty of the blackest ingratitude&mdash;for
      she must have been greatly offended not to have deigned to answer me&mdash;and
      therefore I had not the courage to write a second time. It would have been
      useless, I am sure; for, good and just as she is, her refusals are
      inexorable when she believes them deserved. And besides, for what good? It
      was too late; you had resolved to die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, quite resolved: for my infamy was gnawing at my heart.
      Jacques had died in my arms despising me; and I loved him&mdash;mark me,
      sister,&rdquo; added Cephyse, with passionate enthusiasm, &ldquo;I loved
      him as we love only once in life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let our fate be accomplished, then!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch with a
      pensive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have never told me, sister, the cause of your departure
      from Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s,&rdquo; resumed Cephyse, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the only secret that I shall take with me, dear Cephyse,&rdquo;
      said the other, casting down her eyes. And she thought, with bitter joy,
      that she would soon be delivered from the fear which had poisoned the last
      days of her sad life&mdash;the fear of meeting Agricola, informed of the
      fatal and ridiculous love she felt for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, it must be said, this fatal and despairing love was one of the causes
      of the suicide of the unfortunate creature. Since the disappearance of her
      journal, she believed that the blacksmith knew the melancholy secret
      contained in its sad pages. She doubted not the generosity and good heart
      of Agricola; but she had such doubts of herself, she was so ashamed of
      this passion, however pure and noble, that, even in the extremity to which
      Cephyse and herself were reduced&mdash;wanting work, wanting bread&mdash;no
      power on earth could have induced her to meet Agricola, in an attempt to
      ask him for assistance. Doubtless, she would have taken another view of
      the subject if her mind had not been obscured by that sort of dizziness to
      which the firmest characters are exposed when their misfortunes surpass
      all bounds. Misery, hunger, the influence, almost contagious in such a
      moment, of the suicidal ideas of Cephyse, and weariness of a life so long
      devoted to pain and mortification, gave the last blow to the sewing-girl&rsquo;s
      reason. After long struggling against the fatal design of her sister, the
      poor, dejected, broken-hearted creature finished by determining to share
      Cephyse&rsquo;s fate, and seek in death the end of so many evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what are you thinking, sister?&rdquo; said Cephyse, astonished
      at the long silence. The other replied, trembling: &ldquo;I think of that
      which made me leave Mdlle. de Cardoville so abruptly, and appear so
      ungrateful in her eyes. May the fatality which drove me from her house
      have made no other victims! may my devoted service, however obscure and
      powerless, never be missed by her, who extended her noble hand to the poor
      sempstress, and deigned to call me sister! May she be happy&mdash;oh, ever
      happy!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, clasping her hands with the ardor of a
      sincere invocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is noble, sister&mdash;such a wish in such a moment!&rdquo;
      said Cephyse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said her sister, with energy, &ldquo;I loved, I admired
      that marvel of genius, and heart, and ideal beauty&mdash;I viewed her with
      pious respect&mdash;for never was the power of the Divinity revealed in a
      more adorable and purer creation. At least one of my last thoughts will
      have been of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will have loved and respected your generous patroness to
      the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the last!&rdquo; said the poor girl, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. &ldquo;It is true&mdash;you are right&mdash;it will soon be the
      last!&mdash;in a few moments, all will be finished. See how calmly we can
      talk of that which frightens so many others!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, we are calm because we are resolved.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite resolved, Cephyse,&rdquo; said the hunchback, casting once
      more a deep and penetrating glance upon her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, if you are only as determined as I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied; if I put off from day to day the final moment,&rdquo;
      answered the sempstress, &ldquo;it was because I wished to give you time
      to reflect. As for me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not finish, but she shook her head with an air of the utmost
      despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sister, let us kiss each other,&rdquo; said Cephyse; &ldquo;and,
      courage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunchback rose, and threw herself into her sister&rsquo;s arms. They
      held one another fast in a long embrace. There followed a few seconds of
      deep and solemn silence, only interrupted by the sobs of the sisters, for
      now they had begun to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heaven! to love each other so, and to part forever!&rdquo; said
      Cephyse. &ldquo;It is a cruel fate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To part?&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, and her pale, mild countenance,
      bathed in tears, was suddenly illumined with a ray of divine hope; &ldquo;to
      part, sister? oh, no! What makes me so calm is the deep and certain
      expectation, which I feel here at my heart, of that better world where a
      better life awaits us. God, so great, so merciful, so prodigal of good,
      cannot destine His creatures to be forever miserable. Selfish men may
      pervert His benevolent designs, and reduce their brethren to a state of
      suffering and despair. Let us pity the wicked and leave them! Come up on
      high, sister; men are nothing there, where God is all. We shall do well
      there. Let us depart, for it is late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she pointed to the ruddy beams of the setting sun, which began
      to shine upon the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carried away by the religious enthusiasm of her sister, whose countenance,
      transfigured, as it were, by the hope of an approaching deliverance,
      gleamed brightly in the reflected sunset, Cephyse took her hands, and,
      looking at her with deep emotion, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, sister! how
      beautiful you look now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my beauty comes rather late in the day,&rdquo; said Mother
      Bunch, with a sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sister; for you appear so happy, that the last scruples I had
      upon your account are quite gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us make haste,&rdquo; said the hunchback, as she pointed
      to the chafing-dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, sister&mdash;it will not be long,&rdquo; said
      Cephyse. And she took the chafing-dish full of charcoal, which she had
      placed in a corner of the garret, and brought it out into the middle of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how to manage it?&rdquo; asked the sewing-girl
      approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is very simple,&rdquo; answered Cephyse; &ldquo;we have only
      to close the door and window, and light the charcoal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sister; but I think I have heard that every opening must be
      well stopped, so as to admit no current of air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, and the door shuts so badly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And look at the holes in the roof.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done, sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch. &ldquo;The straw of our
      mattress, well twisted, will answer every purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Cephyse. &ldquo;We will keep a little to
      light our fire, and with the rest we will stop up all the crevices in the
      roof, and make filling for our doors and windows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, smiling with that bitter irony, so frequent, we repeat, in the most
      gloomy moments, Cephyse added, &ldquo;I say, sister, weather-boards at our
      doors and windows, to prevent the air from getting in&mdash;what a luxury!
      we are as delicate as rich people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At such a time, we may as well try to make ourselves a little
      comfortable,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, trying to jest like the Bacchanal
      Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with incredible coolness, the two began to twist the straw into
      lengths of braid, small enough to be stuffed into the cracks of the door,
      and also constructed large plugs, destined to stop up the crevices in the
      roof. While this mournful occupation lasted, there was no departure from
      the calm and sad resignation of the two unfortunate creatures.

      CHAPTER XXXII. SUICIDE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ephyse and her
      sister continued with calmness the preparations for their death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! how many poor young girls, like these sisters, have been, and still
      will be, fatally driven to seek in suicide a refuge from despair, from
      infamy, or from a too miserable existence! And upon society will rest the
      terrible responsibility of these sad deaths, so long as thousands of human
      creatures, unable to live upon the mockery of wages granted to their
      labor, have to choose between these three gulfs of shame and woe; a life
      of enervating toil and mortal privations, causes of premature death;
      prostitution, which kills also, but slowly&mdash;by contempt, brutality,
      and uncleanness; suicide&mdash;which kills at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, the two sisters had constructed, with the straw of their
      couch, the calkings necessary to intercept the air, and to render
      suffocation more expeditious and certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunchback said to her sister, &ldquo;You are the taller, Cephyse, and
      must look to the ceiling; I will take care of the window and door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, sister; I shall have finished before you,&rdquo;
      answered Cephyse.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two began carefully to stop up every crevice through which a
      current of air could penetrate into the ruined garret. Thanks to her tall
      stature, Cephyse was able to reach the holes in the roof, and to close
      them up entirely. When they had finished this sad work, the sisters again
      approached, and looked at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal moment drew near; their faces, though still calm, seemed
      slightly agitated by that strange excitement which always accompanies a
      double suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, &ldquo;now for the fire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt down before the little chafing-dish, filled with charcoal. But
      Cephyse took hold of her under the arm, and obliged her to rise again,
      saying to her, &ldquo;Let me light the fire&mdash;that is my business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Cephyse&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, poor sister, that the smell of charcoal gives you the
      headache!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the simplicity of this speech, for the Bacchanal Queen had spoken
      seriously, the sisters could not forbear smiling sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; resumed Cephyse; &ldquo;why suffer more and
      sooner than is necessary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, pointing to the mattress, which still contained a little straw,
      Cephyse added, &ldquo;Lie down there, good little sister; when our fire is
      alight, I will come and sit down by you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be long, Cephyse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In five minutes it will be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall building, which faced the street, was separated by a narrow court
      from that which contained the retreat of the two sisters, and was so much
      higher, that when the sun had once disappeared behind its lofty roof, the
      garret soon became dark. The light, passing through the dirty panes of the
      small window, fell faintly on the blue and white patchwork of the old
      mattress, on which Mother Bunch was now stretched, covered with rags.
      Leaning on her left arm, with her chin resting in the palm of her hand,
      she looked after her sister with an expression of heart-rending grief.
      Cephyse, kneeling over the chafing-dish, with her face close to the black
      charcoal, above which already played a little bluish flame, exerted
      herself to blow the newly-kindled fire, which was reflected on the pale
      countenance of the unhappy girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was deep. No sound was heard but the panting breath of
      Cephyse, and, at intervals, the slight crackling of the charcoal, which
      began to burn, and already sent forth a faint sickening vapor. Cephyse,
      seeing the fire completely lighted, and feeling already a little dizzy,
      rose from the ground, and said to her sister, as she approached her,
      &ldquo;It is done!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch, kneeling on the mattress,
      whilst Cephyse remained standing, &ldquo;how shall we place ourselves? I
      should like to be near you to the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Cephyse, half executing the measures of which she
      spoke, &ldquo;I will sit on the mattress with my back against the wall.
      Now, little sister, you lie there. Lean your head upon my knees, and give
      me your hand. Are you comfortable so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I cannot see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better. It seems there is a moment&mdash;very short, it is
      true&mdash;in which one suffers a good deal. And,&rdquo; added Cephyse, in
      a voice of emotion, &ldquo;it will be as well not to see each other
      suffer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Cephyse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me kiss that beautiful hair for the last time,&rdquo; said
      Cephyse, as she pressed her lips to the silky locks which crowned the
      hunchback&rsquo;s pale and melancholy countenance, &ldquo;and then&mdash;we
      will remain very quiet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, your hand,&rdquo; said the sewing-girl; &ldquo;for the last
      time, your hand&mdash;and then, as you say, we will move no more. We shall
      not have to wait long, I think, for I begin to feel dizzy. And you,
      sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Cephyse; &ldquo;I only perceive the smell
      of the charcoal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where they will bury us?&rdquo; said Mother Bunch,
      after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I should like it to be in Pere-la-Chaise. I went there once
      with Agricola and his mother. What a fine view there is!&mdash;and then
      the trees, the flowers, the marble&mdash;do you know the dead are better
      lodged&mdash;than the living&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, sister?&rdquo; said Cephyse to her companion,
      who had stopped short, after speaking in a slow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am giddy&mdash;my temples throb,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;How
      do you feel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only begin to be a little faint; it is strange&mdash;the effect
      is slower with me than you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you see,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, trying to smile, &ldquo;I
      was always so forward. At school, do you remember, they said I was before
      the others. And, now it happens again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope soon to overtake you this time,&rdquo; said Cephyse.
    </p>
    <p>
      What astonished the sisters was quite natural. Though weakened by sorrow
      and misery, the Bacchanal Queen, with a constitution as robust as the
      other was frail and delicate, was necessarily longer than her sister in
      feeling the effects of the deleterious vapor. After a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, Cephyse resumed, as she laid her hand on the head she still held
      upon her knees, &ldquo;You say nothing, sister! You suffer, is it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, in a weak voice; &ldquo;my eyelids
      are heavy as lead&mdash;I am getting benumbed&mdash;I feel that I speak
      more slowly&mdash;but I have no acute pain. And you, sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whilst you were speaking, I felt giddy&mdash;and now my temples
      throb violently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it was with me just now. One would think it was more painful and
      difficult to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after a moment&rsquo;s silence, the hunchback said suddenly to her
      sister, &ldquo;Do you think that Agricola will much regret me, and think
      of me for some time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask?&rdquo; said Cephyse, in a tone of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; answered Mother Bunch, mildly; &ldquo;there
      is a bad feeling in such a doubt&mdash;but if you knew&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other hesitated for an instant, and then said, dejectedly, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
      Afterwards, she added, &ldquo;Fortunately, I die convinced that he will
      never miss me. He married a charming girl, who loves him, I am sure, and
      will make him perfectly happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she pronounced these last words, the speaker&rsquo;s voice grew fainter
      and fainter. Suddenly she started and said to Cephyse, in a trembling,
      almost frightened tone, &ldquo;Sister! Hold me in your arms&mdash;I am
      afraid&mdash;everything looks dark&mdash;everything is turning round.&rdquo;
      And the unfortunate girl, raising herself a little, hid her face in her
      sister&rsquo;s bosom, and threw his weak arms around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, sister!&rdquo; said Cephyse, in a voice which was also
      growing faint, as she pressed her closer to her bosom; &ldquo;it will soon
      be over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cephyse added, with a kind of envy, &ldquo;Oh! why does my sister&rsquo;s
      strength fail so much sooner than mine? I have still my perfect senses and
      I suffer less than she does. Oh! if I thought she would die first!&mdash;But,
      no&mdash;I will go and hold my face over the chafing-dish rather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the movement Cephyse made to rise, a feeble pressure from her sister
      held her back. &ldquo;You suffer, my poor child!&rdquo; said Cephyse,
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! a good deal now&mdash;do not leave me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I scarcely at all,&rdquo; said Cephyse, gazing wildly at the
      chafing-dish. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; added she, with a kind of fatal! joy;
      &ldquo;now I begin to feel it&mdash;I choke&mdash;my head is ready to
      split.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed the destructive gas now filled the little chamber, from which
      it had, by degrees, driven all the air fit for respiration. The day was
      closing in, and the gloomy garret was only lighted by the reflection of
      the burning charcoal, which threw a red glare on the sisters, locked in
      each other&rsquo;s arms. Suddenly Mother Bunch made some slight convulsive
      movements, and pronounced these words in a failing voice: &ldquo;Agricola&mdash;Mademoiselle
      de Cardoville&mdash;Oh! farewell!&mdash;Agricola&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she murmured some unintelligible words; the convulsive moments
      ceased, and her arms, which had been clasped round Cephyse, fell inert
      upon the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister!&rdquo; cried Cephyse, in alarm, as she raised Mother Bunch&rsquo;s
      head, to look at her face. &ldquo;Not already, sister!&mdash;And I?&mdash;and
      I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sewing-girl&rsquo;s mild countenance was not paler than usual. Only
      her eyes, half-closed, seemed no longer to see anything, and a half-smile
      of mingled grief and goodness lingered an instant about her violet lips,
      from which stole the almost imperceptible breath&mdash;and then the mouth
      became motionless, and the face assumed a great serenity of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must not die before me!&rdquo; cried Cephyse, in a
      heart-rending tone, as she covered with kisses the cold cheek. &ldquo;Wait
      for me, sister! wait for me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch did not answer. The head, which Cephyse let slip from her
      hands, fell back gently on the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God. It is not my fault, if we do not die together!&rdquo; cried
      Cephyse in despair, as she knelt beside the couch, on which the other lay
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she murmured in terror. &ldquo;Dead before me!&mdash;Perhaps
      it is that I am the strongest. Ah! it begins&mdash;fortunately&mdash;like
      her, I see everything dark-blue&mdash;I suffer&mdash;what happiness!&mdash;I
      can scarcely breathe. Sister!&rdquo; she added, as she threw her arms
      round her loved one&rsquo;s neck; &ldquo;I am coming&mdash;I am here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant the sound of footsteps and voices was heard from the
      staircase. Cephyse had still presence of mind enough to distinguish the
      sound. Stretched beside the body of her sister, she raised her head
      hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise approached, and a voice was heard exclaiming, not far from the
      doer: &ldquo;Good heavens! what a smell of fire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, at the same instant, the door was violently shaken, and another voice
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Open! open!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will come in&mdash;they will save me&mdash;and my sister is
      dead&mdash;Oh, no! I will not have the baseness to survive her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the last thought of Cephyse. Using what little strength she had
      left, she ran to the window and opened it&mdash;and, at the same instant
      that the half-broken door yielded to a vigorous effort from without, the
      unfortunate creature precipitated herself from that third story into the
      court below. Just then, Adrienne and Agricola appeared on the threshold of
      the chamber. In spite of the stifling odor of the charcoal, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville rushed into the garret, and, seeing the stove, she exclaimed,
      &ldquo;The unhappy girl has killed herself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she has thrown herself from the window,&rdquo; cried Agricola:
      for, at the moment of breaking open the door, he had seen a human form
      disappear in that direction, and he now ran to the window.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30165.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this is frightful!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a cry of horror,
      as he put his hand before his eyes, and returned pale and terrified to
      Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, misunderstanding the cause of his terror, Adrienne, who had just
      perceived Mother Bunch through the darkness, hastened to answer: &ldquo;No!
      she is here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she pointed to the pale form stretched on the mattress, beside which
      Adrienne now threw herself on her knees. Grasping the hands of the poor
      sempstress, she found them as cold as ice. Laying her hand on her heart,
      she could not feel it beat. Yet, in a few seconds, as the fresh air rushed
      into the room from the door and window, Adrienne thought she remarked an
      almost imperceptible pulsation, and she exclaimed: &ldquo;Her heart beats!
      Run quickly for help! Luckily, I have my smelling bottle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! help for her&mdash;and for the other too, if it is yet
      time!&rdquo; cried the smith in despair, as he rushed down the stairs,
      leaving Mdlle. de Cardoville still kneeling by the side of the mattress.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. CONFESSIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the painful
      scene that we have just described, a lively emotion glowed in the
      countenance of Mdlle. de Cardoville, grown pale and thin with sorrow. Her
      cheeks, once so full, were now slightly hollowed, whilst a faint line of
      transparent azure encircled those large black eyes, no longer so bright as
      formerly. But the charming lips, though contracted by painful anxiety, had
      retained their rich and velvet moisture. To attend more easily to Mother
      Bunch, Adrienne had thrown aside her bonnet, and the silky waves of her
      beautiful golden hair almost concealed her face as she bent over the
      mattress, rubbing the thin, ivory hands of the poor sempstress, completely
      called to life by the salubrious freshness of the air, and by the strong
      action of the salts which Adrienne carried in her smelling-bottle.
      Luckily, Mother Bunch had fainted, rather from emotion and weakness than
      from the effects of suffocation, the senses of the unfortunate girl having
      failed her before the deleterious gas had attained its highest degree of
      intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before continuing the recital of the scene between the sempstress and the
      patrician, a few retrospective words will be necessary. Since the strange
      adventure at the theatre of the Porte-Saint-Martin, where Djalma, at peril
      of his life, rushed upon the black panther in sight of Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, the young lady had been deeply affected in various ways.
      Forgetting her jealousy, and the humiliation she had suffered in presence
      of Djalma&mdash;of Djalma exhibiting himself before every one with a woman
      so little worthy of him&mdash;Adrienne was for a moment dazzled by the
      chivalrous and heroic action of the prince, and said to herself: &ldquo;In
      spite of odious appearances, Djalma loves me enough to brave death in
      order to pick up my nosegay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with a soul so delicate as that of this young lady, a character so
      generous, and a mind so true, reflection was certain soon to demonstrate
      the vanity of such consolations, powerless to cure the cruel wounds of
      offended dignity an love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times,&rdquo; said Adrienne to herself, and with reason,
      &ldquo;has the prince encountered, in hunting, from pure caprice and with
      no gain, such danger as he braved in picking up my bouquet! and then, who
      tells me he did not mean to offer it to the woman who accompanied him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Singular (it may be) in the eyes of the world, but just and great in those
      of heaven, the ideas which Adrienne cherished with regard to love, joined
      to her natural pride, presented an invincible obstacle to the thought of
      her succeeding this woman (whoever she might be), thus publicly displayed
      by the prince as his mistress. And yet Adrienne hardly dared avow to
      herself, that she experienced a feeling of jealousy, only the more painful
      and humiliating, the less her rival appeared worthy to be compared to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At other times, on the contrary, in spite of a conscious sense of her own
      value, Mdlle. de Cardoville, remembering the charming countenance of
      Rose-Pompon, asked herself if the bad taste and improper manners of this
      pretty creature resulted from precocious and depraved effrontery, or from
      a complete ignorance of the usages of society. In the latter case, such
      ignorance, arising from a simple and ingenuous nature, might in itself
      have a great charm; and if to this attraction, combined with that of
      incontestable beauty, were added sincere love and a pure soul, the obscure
      birth, or neglected education of the girl might be of little consequence,
      and she might be capable of inspiring Djalma with a profound passion. If
      Adrienne hesitated to see a lost creature in Rose-Pompon, notwithstanding
      unfavorable appearances, it was because, remembering what so many
      travellers had related of Djalma&rsquo;s greatness of soul, and recalling
      the conversation she had overheard between him and Rodin, she could not
      bring herself to believe that a man of such remarkable intelligence, with
      so tender a heart, so poetical, imaginative and enthusiastic a mind could
      be capable of loving a depraved and vulgar creature, and of openly
      exhibiting himself in public along with her. There was a mystery in the
      transaction, which Adrienne sought in vain to penetrate. These trying
      doubts, this cruel curiosity, only served to nourish Adrienne&rsquo;s
      fatal love; and we may imagine her incurable despair, when she found that
      the indifference, or even disdain of Djalma, was unable to stifle a
      passion that now burned more fiercely than ever. Sometimes, having
      recourse to notions of fatality, she fancied that she was destined to feel
      this love; that Djalma must therefore deserve it, and that one day
      whatever was incomprehensible in the conduct of the prince would be
      explained to his advantage. At other times, on the contrary, she felt
      ashamed of excusing Djalma, and the consciousness of this weakness was for
      Adrienne a constant occasion for remorse and torture. The victim of all
      these agonies, she lived in perfect solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cholera soon broke out, startling as a clap of thunder. Too unhappy to
      fear the pestilence on her own account, Adrienne was only moved by the
      sorrows of others. She was amongst the first to contribute to those
      charitable donations, which were now flowing in from all sides in the
      admirable spirit of benevolence. Florine was suddenly attacked by the
      epidemic. In spite of the danger, her mistress insisted on seeing her, and
      endeavored to revive her failing courage. Conquered by this new mark of
      kindness, Florine could no longer conceal the treachery in which she had
      borne a part. Death was about to deliver her from the odious tyranny of
      the people whose yoke weighed upon her, and she was at length in a
      position to reveal everything to Adrienne. The latter thus learned how she
      had been continually betrayed by Florine, and also the cause of the
      sewing-girl&rsquo;s abrupt departure. At these revelations, Adrienne felt
      her affection and tender pity for the poor sempstress greatly increase. By
      her command, the most active steps were taken to discover traces of the
      hunchback; but Florine&rsquo;s confession had a still more important
      result. Justly alarmed at this new evidence of Rodin&rsquo;s machinations,
      Adrienne remembered the projects formed, when, believing herself beloved,
      the instinct of affection had revealed to her the perils to which Djalma
      and other members of the Rennepont family were exposed. To assemble the
      race around her, and bid them rally against the common enemy, such was
      Adrienne&rsquo;s first thought, when she heard the confession of Florine.
      She regarded it as a duty to accomplish this project. In a struggle with
      such dangerous and powerful adversaries as Rodin, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      and the Princess de Saint-Dizier, and their allies, Adrienne saw not only
      the praiseworthy and perilous task of unmasking hypocrisy and cupidity,
      but also, if not a consolation, at least a generous diversion in the midst
      of terrible sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this moment, a restless, feverish activity took the place of the
      mournful apathy in which the young lady had languished. She called round
      her all the members of her family capable of answering the appeal, and, as
      had been mentioned in the secret note delivered to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      Cardoville House soon became the centre of the most active and unceasing
      operations, and also a place of meeting, in which the modes of attack and
      defence were fully discussed. Perfectly correct in all points, the secret
      note of which we have spoken stated, as a mere conjecture, that Mdlle. de
      Cardoville had granted an interview to Djalma. This fact was untrue, but
      the cause which led to the supposition will be explained hereafter. Far
      from such being the case, Mdlle. de Cardoville scarcely found, in
      attending to the great family interests now at stake, a momentary
      diversion from the fatal love, which was slowly undermining her health,
      and with which she so bitterly reproached herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the day on which Adrienne, at length discovering Mother
      Bunch&rsquo;s residence, came so miraculously to rescue her from death,
      Agricola Baudoin had been to Cardoville House to confer on the subject of
      Francis Hardy, and had begged Adrienne to permit him to accompany her to
      the Rue Clovis, whither they repaired in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, once again, there was a noble spectacle, a touching symbol! Mdlle.
      de Cardoville and Mother Bunch, the two extremities of the social chain,
      were united on equal terms&mdash;for the sempstress and the fair patrician
      were equal in intelligence and heart&mdash;and equal also, because the one
      was the ideal of riches, grace, and beauty, and the other the ideal of
      resignation and unmerited misfortune&mdash;and does not a halo rest on
      misfortune borne with courage and dignity? Stretched on her mattress, the
      hunchback appeared so weak, that even if Agricola had not been detained on
      the ground floor with Cephyse, now dying a dreadful death, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville would have waited some time, before inducing Mother Bunch to
      rise and accompany her to her carriage. Thanks to the presence of mind and
      pious fraud of Adrienne, the sewing-girl was persuaded that Cephyse had
      been carried to a neighboring hospital, to receive the necessary succors,
      which promised to be crowned with success. The hunchback&rsquo;s faculties
      recovering slowly from their stupor, she at first received this fable
      without the least suspicion&mdash;for she did not even know that Agricola
      had accompanied Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is to you, lady, that Cephyse and I owe our lives,&rdquo;
      said she, turning her mild and melancholy face towards Adrienne, &ldquo;you,
      kneeling in this garret, near this couch of misery, where I and my sister
      meant to die&mdash;for you assure me, lady, that Cephyse was succored in
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied! I was told just now that she was recovering her
      senses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they told her I was living, did they not, lady? Otherwise, she
      would perhaps regret having survived me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite easy, my dear girl!&rdquo; said Adrienne, pressing the
      poor hands in her own, and gazing on her with eyes full of tears; &ldquo;they
      have told her all that was proper. Do not trouble yourself about anything;
      only think of recovering&mdash;and I hope you will yet enjoy that
      happiness of which you have known so little, my poor child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind you are, lady! After flying from your house&mdash;and when
      you must think me so ungrateful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, when you are not so weak, I have a great deal to tell
      you. Just now, it would fatigue you too much. But how do you feel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better, lady. This fresh air&mdash;and then the thought, that,
      since you are come&mdash;my poor sister will no more be reduced to
      despair; for I will tell you all, and I am sure you will have pity on
      Cephyse&mdash;will you not, lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rely upon me, my child,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, forced to
      dissemble her painful embarrassment; &ldquo;you know I am interested in
      all that interests you. But tell me,&rdquo; added Mdlle. de Cardoville, in
      a voice of emotion, &ldquo;before taking this desperate resolution, did
      you not write to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, sorrowfully; &ldquo;and when you
      received no answer&mdash;how cruel, how ungrateful you must have thought
      me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! never, lady, did I accuse you of such feelings; my poor sister
      will tell you so. You had my gratitude to the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&mdash;for I knew your heart. But how then did you
      explain my silence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had justly offended you by my sudden departure, lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offended!&mdash;Alas! I never received your letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you know that I wrote to you, lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my poor girl; I know, also, that you wrote to me at my porter&rsquo;s
      lodge. Unfortunately, he delivered your letter to one of my women, named
      Florine, telling her it came from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine! the young woman that was so kind to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Florine deceived me shamefully; she was sold to my enemies, and
      acted as a spy on my actions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She!&mdash;Good Heavens!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch. &ldquo;Is it
      possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She herself,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, bitterly; &ldquo;but, after
      all, we must pity as well as blame her. She was forced to obey by a
      terrible necessity, and her confession and repentance secured my pardon
      before her death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is dead&mdash;so young! so fair!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of her faults, I was greatly moved by her end. She
      confessed what she had done, with such heart-rending regrets. Amongst her
      avowals, she told me she had intercepted a letter, in which you asked for
      an interview that might save your sister&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, lady; such were the terms of my letter. What interest
      had they to keep it from you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They feared to see you return to me, my good guardian angel. You
      loved me so tenderly, and my enemies dreaded your faithful affection, so
      wonderfully aided by the admirable instinct of your heart. Ah! I shall
      never forget how well-deserved was the horror with which you were inspired
      by a wretch whom I defended against your suspicions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin?&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Adrienne; &ldquo;but we will not talk of these
      people now. Their odious remembrance would spoil the joy I feel in seeing
      you restored to life&mdash;for your voice is less feeble, your cheeks are
      beginning to regain a little color. Thank God! I am so happy to have found
      you once more;&mdash;if you knew all that I hope, all that I expect from
      our reunion&mdash;for we will not part again&mdash;promise me that, in the
      name of our friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;your friend!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, timidly casting down
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few days before your departure from my house, did I not call you
      my friend, my sister? What is there changed? Nothing, nothing,&rdquo;
      added Mdlle. de Cardoville, with deep emotion. &ldquo;One might say, on
      the contrary, that a fatal resemblance in our positions renders your
      friendship even dearer to me. And I shall have it, shall I not. Oh, do not
      refuse it me&mdash;I am so much in want of a friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, lady? you in want of the friendship of a poor creature like
      me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, as she gazed on the other with an
      expression of intense grief; &ldquo;nay, more, you are perhaps the only
      person, to whom I could venture to confide my bitter sorrows.&rdquo; So
      saying, Mdlle. de Cardoville colored deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do I deserve such marks of confidence?&rdquo; asked Mother
      Bunch, more and more surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve it by the delicacy of your heart, by the steadiness of
      your character,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, with some hesitation; &ldquo;then&mdash;you
      are a woman&mdash;and I am certain you will understand what I suffer, and
      pity me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity you, lady?&rdquo; said the other, whose astonishment continued
      to increase. &ldquo;You, a great lady, and so much envied&mdash;I, so
      humble and despised, pity you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, my poor friend,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, after some
      moments of silence, &ldquo;are not the worst griefs those which we dare
      not avow to any one, for fear of raillery and contempt? How can we venture
      to ask interest or pity, for sufferings that we hardly dare avow to
      ourselves, because they make us blush?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sewing-girl could hardly believe what she heard. Had her benefactress
      felt, like her, the effects of an unfortunate passion, she could not have
      held any other language. But the sempstress could not admit such a
      supposition; so, attributing to some other cause the sorrows of Adrienne,
      she answered mournfully, whilst she thought of her own fatal love for
      Agricola, &ldquo;Oh! yes, lady. A secret grief, of which we are ashamed,
      must be frightful&mdash;very frightful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then what happiness to meet, not only a heart noble enough to
      inspire complete confidence, but one which has itself been tried by a
      thousand sorrows, and is capable of affording you pity, support and
      counsel!&mdash;Tell me, my dear child,&rdquo; added Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      as she looked attentively at Mother Bunch, &ldquo;if you were weighed down
      by one of those sorrows, at which one blushes, would you not be happy,
      very happy, to find a kindred soul, to whom you might entrust your griefs,
      and half relieve them by entire and merited confidence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life, Mother Bunch regarded Mdlle. de Cardoville
      with a feeling of suspicion and sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words of the young lady seemed to her full of meaning &ldquo;Doubtless,
      she knows my secret,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch to herself; &ldquo;doubtless,
      my journal has fallen into her hands.&mdash;She knows my love for
      Agricola, or at least suspects it. What she has been saying to me is
      intended to provoke my confidence, and to assure herself if she has been
      rightly informed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts excited in the workgirl&rsquo;s mind no bitter or
      ungrateful feeling towards her benefactress; but the heart of the
      unfortunate girl was so delicately susceptible on the subject of her fatal
      passion, that, in spite of her deep and tender affection for Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, she suffered cruelly at the thought of Adrienne&rsquo;s being
      mistress of her secret.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. MORE CONFESSIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he fancy, at first
      so painful, that Mdlle. de Cardoville was informed of her love for
      Agricola was soon exchanged in the hunchbacks heart, thanks to the
      generous instincts of that rare and excellent creature, for a touching
      regret, which showed all her attachment and veneration for Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch to herself, &ldquo;conquered by
      the influence of the adorable kindness of my protectress, I might have
      made to her a confession which I could make to none other, and revealed a
      secret which I thought to carry with me to my grave. It would, at least,
      have been a mark of gratitude to Mdlle. de Cardoville; but, unfortunately,
      I am now deprived of the sad comfort of confiding my only secret to my
      benefactress. And then&mdash;however generous may be her pity for me,
      however intelligent her affection, she cannot&mdash;she, that is so fair
      and so much admired&mdash;she cannot understand how frightful is the
      position of a creature like myself, hiding in the depth of a wounded
      heart, a love at once hopeless and ridiculous. No, no&mdash;in spite of
      the delicacy of her attachment, my benefactress must unconsciously hurt my
      feelings, even whilst she pities me&mdash;for only sympathetic sorrows can
      console each other. Alas! why did she not leave me to die?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections presented themselves to the thinker&rsquo;s mind as
      rapidly as thought could travel. Adrienne observed her attentively; she
      remarked that the sewing-girl&rsquo;s countenance, which had lately
      brightened up, was again clouded, and expressed a feeling of painful
      humiliation. Terrified at this relapse into gloomy dejection, the
      consequences of which might be serious, for Mother Bunch was still very
      weak, and, as it were, hovering on the brink of the grave, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville resumed hastily: &ldquo;My friend, do not you think with me,
      that the most cruel and humiliating grief admits of consolation, when it
      can be entrusted to a faithful and devoted heart?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lady,&rdquo; said the young sempstress, bitterly; &ldquo;but
      the heart which suffers in silence, should be the only judge of the moment
      for making so painful a confession. Until then, it would perhaps be more
      humane to respect its fatal secret, even if one had by chance discovered
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my child,&rdquo; said Adrienne, sorrowfully, &ldquo;if
      I choose this solemn moment to entrust you with a very painful secret, it
      is that, when you have heard me, I am sure you will set more value on your
      life, as knowing how much I need your tenderness, consolation, and pity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, the other half raised herself on the mattress, and looked
      at Mdlle. de Cardoville in amazement. She could scarcely believe what she
      heard; far from designing to intrude upon her confidence, it was her
      protectress who was to make the painful confession, and who came to
      implore pity and consolation from her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; stammered she; &ldquo;you, lady!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to tell you that I suffer, and am ashamed of my sufferings.
      Yes,&rdquo; added the young lady, with a touching expression, &ldquo;yes&mdash;of
      all confessions, I am about to make the most painful&mdash;I love&mdash;and
      I blush for my love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like myself!&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, involuntarily, clasping her
      hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, with a long-pent-up grief; &ldquo;I
      love, and am not beloved&mdash;and my love is miserable, is impossible&mdash;it
      consumes me&mdash;it kills me&mdash;and I dare not confide to any one the
      fatal secret!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like me,&rdquo; repeated the other, with a fixed look. &ldquo;She&mdash;a
      queen in beauty, rank, wealth, intelligence&mdash;suffers like me. Like
      me, poor unfortunate creature! she loves, and is not loved again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes! like you, I love and am not loved again,&rdquo; cried
      Mdlle. de Cardoville; &ldquo;was I wrong in saying, that to you alone I
      could confide my secret&mdash;because, having suffered the same pangs, you
      alone can pity them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, lady,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, casting down her eyes, and
      recovering from her first amazement, &ldquo;you knew&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew all, my poor child&mdash;but never should I have mentioned
      your secret, had I not had one to entrust you with, of a still more
      painful nature. Yours is cruel, but mine is humiliating. Oh, my sister!&rdquo;
      added Mdlle. de Cardoville, in a tone impossible to describe, &ldquo;misfortune,
      you, see, blends and confounds together what are called distinctions of
      rank and fortune&mdash;and often those whom the world envies are reduced
      by suffering far below the poorest and most humble, and have to seek from
      the latter pity and consolation.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30175.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then, drying her tears, which nosy flowed abundantly, Mdlle. de Cardoville
      resumed, in a voice of emotion: &ldquo;Come, sister! courage, courage! let
      us love and sustain each other. Let this sad and mysterious bond unite us
      forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lady! forgive me. But now that you know the secret of my life,&rdquo;
      said the workgirl, casting down her eyes, and unable to vanquish her
      confusion, &ldquo;it seems to me, that I can never look at you without
      blushing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why? because you love Agricola?&rdquo; said Adrienne. &ldquo;Then
      I must die of shame before you, since, less courageous than you, I had not
      the strength to suffer and be resigned, and so conceal my love in the
      depths of my heart. He that I love, with a love henceforth deprived of
      hope, knew of that love and despised it&mdash;preferring to me a woman,
      the very choice of whom was a new and grievous insult, if I am not much
      deceived by appearances. I sometimes hope that I am deceived on this
      point. Now tell me&mdash;is it for you to blush?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, lady! who could tell you all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you only entrusted to your journal? Well, then&mdash;it was
      the dying Florine who confessed her misdeeds. She had been base enough to
      steal your papers, forced to this odious act, by the people who had
      dominion over her. But she had read your journal&mdash;and as every good
      feeling was not dead within her, your admirable resignation, your
      melancholy and pious love, had left such an impression on her mind, that
      she was able to repeat whole passages to me on her death bed, and thus to
      explain the cause of your sudden disappearance&mdash;for she had no doubt
      that the fear of seeing your love for Agricola divulged had been the cause
      of your flight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is but too true, lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; answered Adrienne, bitterly; &ldquo;those who
      employed the wretched girl to act as she did, well knew the effect of the
      blow. It was not their first attempt. They reduced you to despair, they
      would have killed you, because you were devoted to me, and because you had
      guessed their intentions. Oh! these black-gowns are implacable, and their
      power is great!&rdquo; said Adrienne, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fearful, lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do not be alarmed, dear child; you see, that the arms of the
      wicked have turned against themselves; for the moment I knew the cause of
      your flight, you became dearer to me than ever. From that time I made
      every exertion to find out where you were; after long efforts, it was only
      this morning that the person I had employed succeeded in discovering that
      you inhabited this house. Agricola was with me when I heard it, and
      instantly asked to accompany me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola!&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, clasping her hands; &ldquo;he
      came&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child&mdash;be calm. Whilst I attended to you, he was busy
      with your poor sister. You will soon see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, lady!&rdquo; resumed the hunchback, in alarm. &ldquo;He
      doubtless knows&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love! No, no; be satisfied. Only think of the happiness of
      again seeing your good and worthy brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, lady! may he never know what caused me so much shame, that I
      was like to die of it. Thank God, he is not aware of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us have no more sad thoughts, my child. Only remember,
      that this worthy brother came here in time to save us from everlasting
      regrets&mdash;and you from a great fault. Oh! I do not speak of the
      prejudices of the world, with regard to the right of every creature to
      return to heaven a life that has become too burdensome!&mdash;I only say
      that you ought not to have died, because those who love you, and whom you
      love, were still in need of your assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you happy; Agricola was married to the girl of his
      choice, who will, I am sure, make him happy. To whom could I be useful?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, to myself, as you see&mdash;and then, who tells you that
      Agricola will never have need of you? Who tells you, that his happiness,
      or that of his family, will last forever, and will not be tried by cruel
      shocks? And even if those you love had been destined to be always happy,
      could their happiness be complete without you? And would not your death,
      with which they would perhaps have reproached themselves, have left behind
      it endless regrets?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, lady,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;I was wrong&mdash;the
      dizziness of despair had seized me&mdash;frightful misery weighed upon us&mdash;we
      had not been able to find work for some days&mdash;we lived on the charity
      of a poor woman, and her the cholera carried off. To-morrow or next day,
      we must have died of hunger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die of hunger!&mdash;and you knew where I lived!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had written to you, lady, and receiving no answer, I thought you
      offended at my abrupt departure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, dear child! you must have been, as you say, seized with
      dizziness in that terrible moment; so that I have not the courage to
      reproach you for doubting me a single instant. How can I blame you? Did I
      not myself think of terminating my life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, lady!&rdquo; cried the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought of it&mdash;when they came to tell me, that Florine,
      dying, wished to speak to me. I heard what she had to say; her revelations
      changed my projects. This dark and mournful life which had become
      insupportable to me, was suddenly lighted up. The sense of duty woke
      within me. You were no doubt a prey to horrible misery; it was my duty to
      seek and save you. Florine&rsquo;s confessions unveiled to me the new
      plots of the enemies of my scattered family, dispersed by sorrows and
      cruel losses; it was my duty to warn them of their danger, and to unite
      them against the common enemy. I had been the victim of odious manoeuvres:
      it was my duty to punish their authors, for fear that, encouraged by
      impunity, these black-gowns should make other victims. Then the sense of
      duty gave me strength, and I was able to rouse myself from my lethargy.
      With the help of Abbe Gabriel, a sublime, oh! a sublime priest&mdash;the
      ideal of a true Christian&mdash;the worthy brother of Agricola&mdash;I
      courageously entered on the struggle. What shall I say to you, my child?
      The performance of these duties, the hope of finding you again, have been
      some relief to me in my trouble. If I was not consoled, I was at least
      occupied. Your tender friendship, the example of your resignation, will do
      the rest&mdash;I think so&mdash;I am sure so&mdash;and I shall forget this
      fatal love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Adrienne pronounced these words, rapid footsteps were heard
      upon the stairs, and a young, clear voice exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh! dear me,
      poor Mother Bunch! How lucky I have come just now! If only I could be of
      some use to her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately, Rose-Pompon entered the garret with precipitation.
      Agricola soon followed the grisette, and pointing to the open window,
      tried to make Adrienne understand by signs, that she was not to mention to
      the girl the deplorable end of the Bacchanal Queen. This pantomime was
      lost on Mdlle. de Cardoville. Adrienne&rsquo;s heart swelled with grief,
      indignation, pride, as she recognized the girl she had seen at the Porte
      Saint-Martin in company with Djalma, and who alone was the cause of the
      dreadful sufferings she endured since that fatal evening. And, strange
      irony of fate! it was at the very moment when Adrienne had just made the
      humiliating and cruel confession of her despised love, that the woman, to
      whom she believed herself sacrificed, appeared before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the surprise of Mdlle. de Cardoville was great, Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s was
      not less so. Not only did she recognize in Adrienne the fair young lady
      with the golden locks, who had sat opposite to her at the theatre, on the
      night of the adventure of the black panther, but she had serious reasons
      for desiring most ardently this unexpected interview. It is impossible to
      paint the look of malignant joy and triumph, that she affected to cast
      upon Adrienne. The first impulse of Mdlle. de Cardoville was to quit the
      room. But she could not bear to leave Mother Bunch at this moment, or to
      give, in the presence of Agricola, her reasons for such an abrupt
      departure, and moreover, an inexplicable and fatal curiosity held her
      back, in spite of her offended pride. She remained, therefore, and was
      about to examine closely, to hear and to judge, this rival, who had nearly
      occasioned her death, to whom, in her jealous agony, she had ascribed so
      many different aspects, in order to explain Djalma&rsquo;s love for such a
      creature.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE RIVALS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>ose-Pompon, whose
      presence caused such deep emotion in Mdlle. de Cardoville, was dressed in
      the most showy and extravagant bad taste. Her very small, narrow,
      rose-colored satin bonnet, placed so forward over her face as almost to
      touch the tip of her little nose, left uncovered behind half of her light,
      silky hair; her plaid dress, of an excessively broad pattern, was open in
      front, and the almost transparent gauze, rather too honest in its
      revelations, hardly covered the charms of the form beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grisette having run all the way upstairs, held in her hands the ends
      of her large blue shawl, which, falling from her shoulders, had slid down
      to her wasp-like waist, and there been stopped by the swell of the figure.
      If we enter into these details, it is to explain how, at the sight of this
      pretty creature, dressed in so impertinent and almost indecent, a fashion,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, who thought she saw in her a successful rival, felt
      her indignation, grief, and shame redoubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But judge of the surprise and confusion of Adrienne, when Mdlle. Rose
      Pompon said to her, with the utmost freedom and pertness, &ldquo;I am
      delighted to see you, madame. You and I must have a long talk together.
      Only I must begin by kissing poor Mother Bunch&mdash;with your permission,
      madame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand the tone and manner with which this word, &ldquo;madame&rdquo;
      was pronounced, you must have been present at some stormy discussion
      between two Rose-Pompons, jealous of each other; then you would be able to
      judge how much provoking hostility may be compressed into the word &ldquo;madame,&rdquo;
      under certain circumstances. Amazed at the impudence of Rose-Pompon,
      Mdlle. de Cardoville remained mute; whilst Agricola, entirely occupied
      with the interest he took in the workgirl, who had never withdrawn her
      eyes from him since he entered the room, and with the remembrance of the
      painful scene he had just quitted, whispered to Adrienne, without
      remarking the grisette&rsquo;s effrontery, &ldquo;Alas, lady! it is all
      over. Cephyse has just breathed her last sigh, without recovering her
      senses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate girl!&rdquo; said Adrienne, with emotion; and for the
      moment she forgot Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must keep this sad news from Mother Bunch, and only let her know
      it hereafter, with great caution,&rdquo; resumed Agricola. &ldquo;Luckily,
      little Rose Pompon knows nothing about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed to the grisette, who was now stooping down by the side of
      the workgirl. On hearing Agricola speak so familiarly of Rose-Pompon,
      Adrienne&rsquo;s amazement increased. It is impossible to describe what
      she felt; yet, strangely enough, her sufferings grew less and less, and
      her anxiety diminished, as she listened to the chatter of the grisette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good dear!&rdquo; said the latter, with as much volubility
      as emotion, while her pretty blue eyes were filled with tears; &ldquo;is
      it possible that you did so stupid a thing? Do not poor people help one
      another? Could you not apply to me? You knew that others are welcome to
      whatever is mine, and I would have made a raffle of Philemon&rsquo;s
      bazaar,&rdquo; added this singular girl, with a burst of feeling, at once
      sincere, touching, and grotesque; &ldquo;I would have sold his three
      boots, pipes, boating-costume, bed, and even his great drinking-glass, and
      at all events you should not have been brought to such an ugly pass.
      Philemon would not have minded, for he is a good fellow; and if he had
      minded, it would have been all the same. Thank heaven! we are not married.
      I am only wishing to remind you that you should have thought of little
      Rose-Pompon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are obliging and kind, miss,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch:
      for she had heard from her sister that Rose-Pompon, like so many of her
      class, had a warm and generous heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; resumed the grisette, wiping with the back of her
      hand the tip of her little nose, down which a tear was trickling, &ldquo;you
      may tell me that you did not know where I had taken up my quarters. It&rsquo;s
      a queer story, I can tell you. When I say queer,&rdquo; added Rose-Pompon,
      with a deep sigh, &ldquo;it is quite the contrary&mdash;but no matter: I
      need not trouble you with that. One thing is certain; you are getting
      better&mdash;and you and Cephyse will not do such a thing again. She is
      said to be very weak. Can I not see her yet, M. Agricola?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the smith, with embarrassment, for Mother Bunch
      kept her eyes fixed upon him; &ldquo;you must have patience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I may see her to-day, Agricola?&rdquo; exclaimed the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will talk about that. Only be calm, I entreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30181m.jpg" alt="30181m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30181.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agricola is right; you must be reasonable, my good dear,&rdquo;
      resumed Rose Pompon; &ldquo;we will wait patiently. I can wait too, for I
      have to talk presently to this lady;&rdquo; and Rose-Pompon glanced at
      Adrienne with the expression of an angry cat. &ldquo;Yes, yes; I can wait;
      for I long to tell Cephyse also that she may reckon upon me.&rdquo; Here
      Rose-Pompon bridled up very prettily, and thus continued, &ldquo;Do not be
      uneasy! It is the least one can do, when one is in a good position, to
      share the advantages with one&rsquo;s friends, who are not so well off. It
      would be a fine thing to keep one&rsquo;s happiness to one&rsquo;s self!
      to stuff it with straw, and put it under a glass, and let no one touch it!
      When I talk of happiness, it&rsquo;s only to make talk; it is true in one
      sense; but to another, you see, my good dear&mdash;Bah! I am only
      seventeen&mdash;but no matter&mdash;I might go on talking till tomorrow,
      and you would not be any the wiser. So let me kiss you once more, and don&rsquo;t
      be down-hearted&mdash;nor Cephyse either, do you hear? for I shall be
      close at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, stooping still lower, Rose-Pompon cordially embraced Mother Bunch. It
      is impossible to express what Mdlle. de Cardoville felt during this
      conversation, or rather during this monologue of the grisette on the
      subject of the attempted suicide. The eccentric jargon of Mdlle. Rose
      Pompon, her liberal facility in disposing of Philemon&rsquo;s bazaar, to
      the owner of which (as she said) she was luckily not married&mdash;the
      goodness of her heart, which revealed itself in her offers of service&mdash;her
      contrasts, her impertinence, her drollery&mdash;all this was so new and
      inexplicable to Mdlle. de Cardoville, that she remained for some time mute
      and motionless with surprise. Such, then, was the creature to whom Djalma
      had sacrificed her!
    </p>
    <p>
      If Adrienne&rsquo;s first impression at sight of Rose-Pompon had been
      horribly painful, reflection soon awakened doubts, which were to become
      shortly ineffable hopes. Remembering the interview she had overheard
      between Rodin and Djalma, when, concealed in the conservatory, she had
      wished to prove the Jesuit&rsquo;s fidelity, Adrienne, asked herself if it
      was reasonable, if it was possible to believe, that the prince, whose
      ideas of love seemed to be so poetical, so elevated, so pure, could find
      any charm in the disjointed and silly chat of this young girl? Adrienne
      could not hesitate; she pronounced the thing impossible, from the moment
      she had seen her rival near, and witnessed her style both of manners and
      conversation, which, without detracting from the prettiness of her
      features, gave them a trivial and not very attractive character. Adrienne&rsquo;s
      doubts with regard to the deep love of the prince for Rose Pompon were
      hence soon changed to complete incredulity. Endowed with too much sense
      and penetration, not to perceive that this apparent connection, so
      inconceivable on the part of Djalma, must conceal some mystery, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville felt her hopes revive. As this consoling thought arose in her
      mind, her heart, until now so painfully oppressed, began once more to
      dilate; she felt vague aspirations towards a better future; and yet,
      cruelly warned by the past, she feared to yield too readily to a mere
      illusion, for she remembered the notorious fact that the prince had really
      appeared in public with this girl. But now that Mdlle. de Cardoville could
      fully appreciate what she was, she found the conduct of the prince only
      the more incomprehensible. And how can we judge soundly and surely of that
      which is enveloped in mystery? And then a secret presentiment told her,
      that it would, perhaps, be beside the couch of the poor sempstress, whom
      she had just saved from death, that, by a providential coincidence, she
      would learn the secret on which depended the happiness of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emotions which agitated she heart of Adrienne, became so violent, that
      her fine face was flushed with a bright red, her bosom heaved, and her
      large, black eyes, lately dimmed by sadness, once more shone with a mild
      radiance. She waited with inexpressible impatience for what was to follow.
      In the interview, with which Rose-Pompon had threatened her, and which a
      few minutes before Adrienne would have declined with all the dignity of
      legitimate indignation, she now hoped to find the explanation of a
      mystery, which it was of such importance for her to clear up. After once
      more tenderly embracing Mother Bunch, Rose-Pompon got up from the ground,
      and, turning towards Adrienne, eyed her from head to foot, with the utmost
      coolness, and said to her, in a somewhat impertinent tone: &ldquo;It is
      now our turn, madame&rdquo;&mdash;the word &ldquo;madame&rdquo; still
      pronounced with the accent before described&mdash;&ldquo;we have a little
      matter to settle together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your order,&rdquo; answered Adrienne, with much mildness
      and simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the triumphant and decisive air of Rose-Pompon, and on hearing
      her challenge to Mdlle. de Cardoville, the worthy Agricola, after
      exchanging a few words with Mother Bunch, opened his eyes and ears very
      wide, and remained staring in amazement at the effrontery of the grisette;
      then, advancing towards her, he whispered, as he plucked her by the
      sleeve: &ldquo;I say, are you mad? Do you know to whom you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what then? Is not one pretty woman worth another! I say that
      for the lady. She will not eat me, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Rose-Pompon,
      aloud, and with an air of defiance. &ldquo;I have to talk with madame,
      here. I am sure, she knows why and wherefore. If not, I will tell her; it
      will not take me long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, who feared some ridiculous exposure on the subject of Djalma, in
      the presence of Agricola, made a sign to the latter, and thus answered the
      grisette: &ldquo;I am ready to hear you, miss, but not in this place. You
      will understand why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, madame, I have my key. You can come to any apartments&rdquo;&mdash;the
      last word pronounced with an air of ostentatious importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go then to your apartments, miss since you to me the honor
      to receive me there,&rdquo; answered Mdlle. de Cardoville, in her mild,
      sweet voice, and with a slight inclination of the head, so full of
      exquisite politeness, that Rose-Pompon was daunted, notwithstanding all
      her effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, lady!&rdquo; said Agricola to Adrienne; &ldquo;you are good
      enough&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Agricola,&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville, interrupting him,
      &ldquo;please to remain with our poor friend: I shall soon be back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, approaching Mother Bunch, who shared in Agricola&rsquo;s
      astonishment she said to her: &ldquo;Excuse me for leaving you a few
      seconds. Only regain a little strength, and, when I return, I will take
      you home with me, dear sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning towards Rose-Pompon, who was more and more surprised at
      hearing so fine a lady call the workgirl her sister, she added: &ldquo;I
      am ready whenever you please, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, madame, if I go first to show you the way, but it&rsquo;s
      a regular break-neck sort of a place,&rdquo; answered Rose-Pompon,
      pressing her elbows to her sides, and screwing up her lips to prove that
      she was no stranger to polite manners and fine language. And the two
      rivals quitted the garret together, leaving Agricola alone with Mother
      Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, the disfigured remains of the Bacchanal Queen had been carried
      into Mother Arsene&rsquo;s subterraneous shop, so that the crowd of
      spectators, always attracted by any fatal event, had assembled in front of
      the house; and Rose-Pompon, meeting no one in the little court she had to
      traverse with Adrienne, continued in ignorance of the tragical death of
      her old friend Cephyse. In a few moments the grisette and Mdlle. de
      Cardoville had reached Philemon&rsquo;s apartment. This singular abode
      remained in the same state of picturesque disorder in which Rose-Pompon
      had left it, when Ninny Moulin came to fetch her to act the heroine of a
      mysterious adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, completely ignorant of the eccentric modes of life of students
      and their companions, could not, in spite of the thoughts which occupied
      her mind, forebear examining, with a mixture of surprise and curiosity,
      this strange and grotesque chaos, composed of the most dissimilar objects&mdash;disguises
      for masked balls, skulls with pipes in their mouths, odd boots standing on
      book shelves, monstrous bottles, women&rsquo;s clothes, ends of tobacco
      pipes, etc., etc. To the first astonishment of Adrienne succeeded an
      impression of painful repugnance. The young lady felt herself uneasy and
      out of place in this abode, not of poverty, but disorder; whilst, on the
      contrary, the sewing-girl&rsquo;s miserable garret had caused her no such
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose-Pompon, notwithstanding all her airs, was considerably troubled when
      she found herself alone with Mdlle, de Cardoville; the rare beauty of the
      young patrician, her fashionable look, the elegance of her manners, the
      style, both dignified and affable, with which she had answered the
      impertinent address of the grisette, began to have their effect upon the
      latter, who, being moreover a good-natured girl, had been touched at
      hearing Mdlle. de Cardoville call the hunchback &ldquo;friend and sister.&rdquo;
      Without knowing exactly who Adrienne was, Rose-Pompon was not ignorant
      that she belonged to the richest and highest class of society; she felt
      already some remorse at having attacked her so cavalierly; and her
      intentions, at first very hostile with regard to Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      were gradually much modified. Yet, being very obstinate, and not wishing
      to appear to submit to an influence that offended her pride, Rose-Pompon
      endeavored to recover her assurance; and, having bolted the door, she said
      to Adrienne: &ldquo;Pray do me the favor to sit down, madame&rdquo;&mdash;still
      with the intention of showing that she was no stranger to refined manners
      and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. de Cardoville was about mechanically to take a chair, when Rose
      Pompon, worthy to practise those ancient virtues of hospitality, which
      regarded even an enemy as sacred in the person of a guest, cried out
      hastily: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take that chair, madame; it wants a leg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne laid her hand on another chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor that either; the back is quite loose,&rdquo; again exclaimed
      Rose-Pompon. And she spoke the truth; for the chair-back, which was made
      in the form of a lyre, remained in the hands of Mdlle. de Cardoville, who
      said, as she replaced it discreetly in its former position: &ldquo;I
      think, miss, that we can very well talk standing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, madame,&rdquo; replied Rose-Pompon, steadying
      herself the more bravely the more uneasy she felt. And the interview of
      the lady and the grisette began in this fashion.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter a minute&rsquo;s
      hesitation, Rose-Pompon said to Adrienne, whose heart was beating
      violently: &ldquo;I will tell you directly, madame, what I have on my
      mind. I should not have gone out of my way to seek you, but, as I happen
      to fall in with you, it is very natural I should take advantage of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, miss,&rdquo; said Adrienne, mildly, &ldquo;may I at least know
      the subject of the conversation we are to have together?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; replied Rose-Pompon, affecting an air of still
      more decided confidence; &ldquo;first of all, you must not suppose I am
      unhappy, or going to make a scene of jealousy, or cry like a forsaken
      damsel. Do not flatter yourself! Thank heaven, I have no reason to
      complain of Prince Charming&mdash;that is the pet name I gave him&mdash;on
      the contrary, he has made me very happy. If I left him, it was against his
      will, and because I chose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rose-Pompon, whose heart was swelling in spite of her fine
      airs, could not repress a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;I left him because I chose&mdash;for
      he quite doted on me. If I had liked, he would have married me&mdash;yes,
      madame, married me&mdash;so much the worse, if that gives you pain.
      Though, when I say &lsquo;so much the worse,&rsquo; it is true that I
      meant to pain you. To be sure I did&mdash;but then, just now when I saw
      you so kind to poor Mother Bunch, though I was certainly in the right,
      still I felt something. However, to cut matters short, it is clear that I
      detest you, and that you deserve it,&rdquo; added Rose-Pompon, stamping
      her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all this it resulted, even for a person much less sagacious than
      Adrienne, and much less interested in discovering the truth, that Rose
      Pompon, notwithstanding her triumphant airs in speaking of him whom she
      represented as so much attached to her, and even anxious to wed her, was
      in reality completely disappointed, and was now taking refuge in a
      deliberate falsehood. It was evident that she was not loved, and that
      nothing but violent jealousy had induced her to desire this interview with
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, in order to make what is vulgarly called a scene,
      considering Adrienne (the reason will be explained presently) as her
      successful rival. But Rose-Pompon, having recovered her good-nature, found
      it very difficult to continue the scene in question, particularly as, for
      many reasons, she felt overawed by Adrienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she had expected, if not the singular speech of the grisette, at
      least something of the same result&mdash;for she felt it was impossible
      that the prince could entertain a serious attachment for this girl&mdash;Mdlle.
      de Cardoville was at first delighted to hear the confirmation of her hopes
      from the lips of her rival; but suddenly these hopes were succeeded by a
      cruel apprehension, which we will endeavor to explain. What Adrienne had
      just heard ought to have satisfied her completely. Sure that the heart of
      Djalma had never ceased to belong to her, she ought, according to the
      customs and opinions of the world, to have cared little if, in the
      effervescence of an ardent youth, he had chanced to yield to some
      ephemeral caprice for this creature, who was, after all, very pretty and
      desirable&mdash;the more especially as he had now repaired his error by
      separating from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding these good reasons, such an error of the senses would not
      have been pardoned by Adrienne. She did not understand that complete
      separation of the body and soul that would make the one exempt from the
      stains of the other. She did not think it a matter of indifference to toy
      with one woman whilst you were thinking of another. Her young, chaste,
      passionate love demanded an absolute fealty&mdash;a fealty as just in the
      eyes of heaven and nature as it may be ridiculous and foolish in the eyes
      of man. For the very reason that she cherished a refined religion of the
      senses, and revered them as an adorable and divine manifestation, Adrienne
      had all sorts of delicate scruples and nice repugnances, unknown to the
      austere spirituality of those ascetic prudes who despise vile matter too
      much to take notice of its errors, and allow it to grovel in filth, to
      show the contempt in which they hold it. Mdlle. de Cardoville was not one
      of those wonderfully modest creatures who would die of confusion rather
      than say plainly that they wished for a young and handsome husband, at
      once ardent and pure. It is true that they generally marry old, ugly, and
      corrupted men, and make up for it by taking two or three lovers six months
      after. But Adrienne felt instinctively how much of virginal and celestial
      freshness there is in the equal innocence of two loving and passionate
      beings&mdash;what guarantees for the future in the remembrance which a man
      preserves of his first love!
    </p>
    <p>
      We say, then, that Adrienne was only half-satisfied, though convinced by
      the vexation of Rose-Pompon that Djalma had never entertained a serious
      attachment for the grisette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you detest me, miss?&rdquo; said Adrienne mildly, when
      Rose-Pompon had finished her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! bless me, madame!&rdquo; replied the latter, forgetting
      altogether her assumption of triumph, and yielding to the natural
      sincerity of her character; &ldquo;pretend that you don&rsquo;t know why I
      detest you!&mdash;Oh, yes! people go and pick bouquets from the jaws of a
      panther for people that they care nothing about, don&rsquo;t they? And if
      it was only that!&rdquo; added Rose-Pompon, who was gradually getting
      animated, and whose pretty face, at first contracted into a sullen pout,
      now assumed an expression of real and yet half-comic sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it was only the nosegay!&rdquo; resumed she. &ldquo;Though
      it gave me a dreadful turn to see Prince Charming leap like a kid upon the
      stage, I might have said to myself: &lsquo;Pooh! these Indians have their
      own way of showing politeness. Here, a lady drops her nosegay, and a
      gentleman picks it up and gives it to her; but in India it is quite
      another thing; the man picks up the nosegay, and does not return it to the
      woman&mdash;he only kills a panther before her eyes.&rsquo; Those are good
      manners in that country, I suppose; but what cannot be good manners
      anywhere is to treat a woman as I have been treated. And all thanks to
      you, madame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These complaints of Rose-Pompon, at once bitter and laughable, did not at
      all agree with what she had previously stated as to Djalma&rsquo;s
      passionate love for her; but Adrienne took care not to point out this
      contradiction, and said to her, mildly: &ldquo;You must be mistaken, miss,
      when you suppose that I had anything to do with your troubles. But, in any
      case, I regret sincerely that you should have been ill-treated by any one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think I have been beaten, you are quite wrong,&rdquo;
      exclaimed Rose Pompon. &ldquo;Ah! well, I am sure! No, it is not that. But
      I am certain that, had it not been for you, Prince Charming would have got
      to love me a little. I am worthy of the trouble, after all&mdash;and then
      there are different sorts of love&mdash;I am not so very particular&mdash;not
      even so much as that,&rdquo; added Rose-Pompon, snapping her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;when Ninny Moulin came to fetch
      me, and brought me jewels and laces to persuade me to go with him, he was
      quite right in saying there was no harm in his offers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ninny Moulin?&rdquo; asked Mdlle. de Cardoville, becoming more and
      more interested; &ldquo;who is this Ninny Moulin, miss?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30189.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A religious writer,&rdquo; answered Rose-Pompon, pouting; &ldquo;the
      right-hand man of a lot of old sacristans, whose money he takes on
      pretense of writing about morality and religion. A fine morality it is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words&mdash;&ldquo;a religious writer&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;sacristans&rdquo;
      Adrienne instantly divined some new plot of Rodin or Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      of which she and Djalma were to have been the victims. She began vaguely
      to perceive the real state of the case, as she resumed: &ldquo;But, miss,
      under what pretence could this man take you away with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to fetch me, and said I need not fear for my virtue, and
      was only to make myself look pretty. So I said to myself: &lsquo;Philemon&rsquo;s
      out of town, and it&rsquo;s very dull here all alone: This seems a droll
      affair; what can I risk by it?&rsquo;&mdash;Alas! I didn&rsquo;t know what
      I risked,&rdquo; added Rose Pompon, with a sigh. &ldquo;Well! Ninny Moulin
      takes me away in a fine carriage. We stop in the Place du Palais-Royal. A
      sullen-looking man, with a yellow face, gets up in the room of Ninny
      Moulin, and takes me to the house of Prince Charming. When I saw him&mdash;la!
      he was so handsome, so very handsome, that I was quite dizzy-like; and he
      had such a kind, noble air, that I said to myself, &lsquo;Well! there will
      be some credit if I remain a good girl now!&rsquo;&mdash;I did not know
      what a true word I was speaking. I have been good&mdash;oh! worse than
      good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, miss! do you regret having been so virtuous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, I regret, at least, that I have not had the pleasure
      of refusing. But how can you refuse, when nothing is asked&mdash;when you
      are not even thought worth one little loving word?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, miss, allow me to observe to you that the indifference of
      which you complain does not see to have prevented your making a long stay
      in the house in question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know why the prince kept me there, or took me out
      riding with him, or to the play? Perhaps it is the fashion in his savage
      country to have a pretty girl by your side, and to pay no attention to her
      at all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, then, did you remain, miss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I remain?&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon, stamping her loot with
      vexation. &ldquo;I remained because, without knowing how it happened, I
      began to get very fond of Prince Charming; and what is queer enough, I,
      who am as gay as a lark, loved him because he was so sorrowful, which
      shows that it was a serious matter. At last, one day, I could hold out no
      longer. I said: &lsquo;Never mind; I don&rsquo;t care for the
      consequences. Philemon, I am sure, is having his fun in the country.&rsquo;
      That set my mind at ease. So one morning, I dress myself in my best, all
      very pretty, look in my glass, and say: &lsquo;Well, that will do&mdash;he
      can&rsquo;t stand that! and, going to his room, I tell him all that passes
      through my head; I laugh, I cry&mdash;at last I tell him that I adore him.
      What do you think he answers, in his mild voice, and as cold as a piece of
      marble? Why, &lsquo;Poor child&mdash;poor child&mdash;poor child!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      added Rose-Pompon, with indignation; &ldquo;neither more nor less than if
      I had come to complain to him of the toothache. But the worst of it is
      that I am sure, if he were not in love elsewhere, he would be all fire and
      gunpowder. Only now he is so sad, so dejected!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, pausing a moment, Rose-Pompon added: &ldquo;No, I will not tell you
      that; you would be too pleased.&rdquo; But, after another pause, she
      continued: &ldquo;Well, never mind; I will tell you, though&rdquo;; and
      this singular girl looked at Mdlle. de Cardoville with a mixture of
      sympathy and deference. &ldquo;Why should I keep it from you? I began by
      riding the high horse, and saying that the prince wished to marry me; and
      I finished by confessing that he almost turned me out. Well, it&rsquo;s
      not my fault; when I try to fib, I am sure to get confused. So, madame,
      this is the plain truth:&mdash;When I met you at poor Mother Bunch&rsquo;s,
      I was at first as angry as a little turkey-cock; but when I heard you,
      that are such a fine great lady, speak so kindly to the poor girl, and
      treat her as your sister, do what I would, my anger began to go away.
      Since we have been here, I have done my utmost to get it up again; but I
      find it impossible, and the more I see the difference between us, the more
      I perceive that Prince Charming was right in thinking so much of you. For
      you must know, madame, that he is over head and ears in love with you. I
      don&rsquo;t say so merely because he killed the panther for you at the
      Porte-Saint-Martin; but if you knew all the tricks he played with your
      bouquet, and how he will sit up all night weeping in that room where he
      saw you for the first time&mdash;and then your portrait, that he has drawn
      upon glass, after the fashion of his country, and so many other things&mdash;the
      fact is, that I, who was fond of him, and saw all this was at first in a
      great rage; but afterwards it was so touching that it brought the tears
      into my eyes. Yes, madame, just as it does now, when I merely think of the
      poor prince. Oh, madame!&rdquo; added Rose-Pompon, her eyes swimming in
      tears, and with such an expression of sincere interest, that Adrienne was
      much moved by it; &ldquo;oh, madame, you look so mild and good, that you
      will not make this poor prince miserable. Pray love him a little bit; what
      can it matter to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rose-Pompon, with a perfectly simple, though too familiar,
      gesture, took hold of Adrienne&rsquo;s hand, as if to enforce her request.
      It had required great self-command in Mdlle. de Cardoville to repress the
      rush of joy that was mounting from her heart to her lips, to check the
      torrent of questions which she burned to address to Rose-Pompon, and to
      restrain the sweet tears of happiness that for some seconds had trembled
      in her eyes; and, strangely enough, when Rose-Pompon took her hand,
      Adrienne, instead of withdrawing it, pressed the offered hand almost
      affectionately, and led her towards the window, as if to examine her sweet
      face more attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the room, the grisette had thrown her bonnet and shawl down
      upon the bed, so that Adrienne could admire the thick and silky masses of
      light hair that crowned the fresh face of the charming girl, with its
      firm, rosy cheeks, its mouth as red as a cherry, and its large blue
      laughing eyes; and, thanks to the somewhat scanty dress of Rose-Pompon,
      Adrienne could fully appreciate the various graces of her nymph-like
      figure. Strange as it may appear, Adrienne was delighted at finding the
      girl still prettier than she had at first imagined. The stoical
      indifference of Djalma to so attractive a creature was the best proof of
      the sincerity of the passion by which he was actuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having taken the hand of Adrienne, Rose-Pompon was herself confused and
      surprised at the kindness with which Mdlle. de Cardoville permitted this
      familiarity. Emboldened by this indulgence, and by the silence of
      Adrienne, who for some moments had been contemplating her with almost
      grateful benevolence, the grisette resumed: &ldquo;Oh, you will not
      refuse, madame? You will take pity on this poor prince?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot tell how Adrienne would have answered this indiscreet question
      of Rose-Pompon, for suddenly a loud, wild, shrill, piercing sound,
      evidently intended to imitate the crowing of a cock, was heard close to
      the door of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne started in alarm; but the countenance of Rose Pompon, just now so
      sad, brightened up joyously at this signal, and, clapping her hands she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;It is Philemon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;who?&rdquo; said Adrienne, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lover; oh, the monster! he must have come upstairs on tiptoe, to
      take me by surprise with his crowing. Just like him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A second cock-a-doodle-doo, still louder than the first, was heard close
      to the door. &ldquo;What a stupid, droll creature it is! Always the same
      joke, and yet it always amuses me,&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And drying her tears with the back of her hand, she began to laugh like
      one bewitched at Philemon&rsquo;s jest, which, though well known to her,
      always seemed new and agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not open the door,&rdquo; whispered Adrienne, much embarrassed;
      &ldquo;do not answer, I beg of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though the door is bolted, the key is on the outside; Philemon can
      see that there is some one at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter&mdash;do not let him in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, madame, he lives here; the room belongs to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Philemon, probably growing tired of the little effect produced by
      his two ornithological imitations, turned the key in the lock, and finding
      himself unable to open the door, said in a deep bass voice: &ldquo;What,
      dearest puss, have you shut yourself in? Are you praying Saint Flambard
      for the return of Philly?&rdquo; (short for Philemon.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne, not coshing to increase, by prolonging it, the awkwardness of
      this ridiculous situation, went straight to the door and opened it, to the
      great surprise of Philemon, who recoiled two or three steps.
      Notwithstanding the annoyance of this incident, Mdlle. de Cardoville could
      not help smiling at sight of Rose-Pompon&rsquo;s lover, and of the
      articles he carried in his hand or under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philemon was a tall fellow, with dark hair and a very fresh color, and,
      being just arrived from a journey, he wore a white cap; his thick, black
      beard flowed down on his sky-blue waistcoat; and a short olive-colored
      velvet shooting-coat, with extravagantly large plaid trousers, completed
      his costume. As for the accessories which had provoked a smile from
      Adrienne, they consisted: first, of a portmanteau tucked under his arm,
      with the head and neck of a goose protruding from it; secondly, of a cage
      held in his hand, with an enormous white rabbit all alive within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the darling white rabbit! what pretty red eyes!&rdquo; Such, it
      must be confessed, was the first exclamation of Rose-Pompon, though
      Philemon, to whom it was not addressed, had returned after a long absence;
      but the student far from being shocked at seeing himself thus sacrificed
      to his long-earned companion, smiled complacently, rejoicing at the
      success of his attempt to please his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this passed very rapidly. While Rose-Pompon, kneeling before the cage,
      was still occupied with her admiration of the rabbit, Philemon, struck
      with the lofty air of Mdlle. de Cardoville, raised his hand to his cap,
      and bowed respectfully as he made way for her to pass. Adrienne returned
      his salutation with politeness, full of grace and dignity, and, lightly
      descending the stairs, soon disappeared. Dazzled by her beauty, as well as
      impressed with her noble and lofty bearing, and curious to know how in the
      world Rose-Pompon had fallen in with such an acquaintance, Philemon said
      to her, in his amorous jargon: &ldquo;Dearest puss! tell her Philly who is
      that fine lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my school-fellows, you great satyr!&rdquo; said Rose-Pompon,
      still playing with the rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, glancing at a box, which Philemon deposited close to the cage and
      the portmanteau, she added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager anything you have
      brought me some more preserves!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philly has brought something better to his dear puss,&rdquo; said
      the student, imprinting two vigorous kisses on the rosy cheeks of
      Rose-Pompon, who had at length, consented to stand up; &ldquo;Philly has
      brought her his heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo; said the grisette, delicately placing the thumb of
      her left hand on the tip of her nose, and opening the fingers, which she
      slightly moved to and fro. Philemon answered this provocation by putting
      his arm around her waist; and then the happy pair shut their door.

      CHAPTER XXXVII. SOOTHING WORDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the
      interview of Adrienne with Rose-Pompon a touching scene took place between
      Agricola and Mother Bunch, who had been much surprised at Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&rsquo;s condescension with regard to the grisette. Immediately
      after the departure of Adrienne, Agricola had knelt down beside Mother
      Bunch, and said to her, with profound emotion: &ldquo;We are alone, and I
      can at length tell you what weighs upon my heart. This act is too cruel&mdash;to
      die of misery and despair, and not to send to me for assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Agricola&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there is no excuse for this. What! we called each other by the
      names of brother and sister, and for fifteen years gave every proof of
      sincere affection&mdash;and, when the day of misfortune comes, you quit
      life without caring for those you must leave behind&mdash;without
      considering that to kill yourself is to tell them they are indifferent to
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Agricola! it is true. I had never thought of that,&rdquo;
      said the workgirl, casting down her eyes; &ldquo;but poverty&mdash;want of
      work&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misery! want of work! and was I not here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And despair!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why despair? This generous young lady had received you in her
      house; she knew your worth, and treated you as her friend&mdash;and just
      at the moment when you had every chance of happiness, you leave the house
      abruptly, and we remain in the most horrible anxiety on your account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared&mdash;to be&mdash;to be a burden to my benefactress,&rdquo;
      stammered she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a burden to Mdlle. de Cardoville, that is so rich and good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared to be indiscreet,&rdquo; said the sewing-girl, more and
      more embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering his adopted sister, Agricola remained silent, and
      contemplated her for some moments with an undefinable expression; then he
      exclaimed suddenly, as if replying to a question put by himself: &ldquo;She
      will forgive me for disobeying her.&mdash;I am sure of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He next turned towards Mother Bunch, who was looking at him in
      astonishment, and said to her in a voice of emotion: &ldquo;I am too frank
      to keep up this deception. I am reproaching you&mdash;blaming you&mdash;and
      my thoughts are quite different.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so, Agricola?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart aches, when I think of the evil I have done you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, my friend; you have never done me any
      evil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! never? even in little things? when, for instance, yielding to
      a detestable habit, I, who loved and respected you as my sister, insulted
      you a hundred times a day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insulted me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;when I gave you an odious and ridiculous nickname,
      instead of calling you properly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Mother Bunch looked at the smith in the utmost alarm,
      trembling lest he had discovered her painful secret, notwithstanding the
      assurance she had received from Mdlle. de Cardoville. Yet she calmed
      herself a little when she reflected, that Agricola might of himself have
      thought of the humiliation inflicted on her by calling her Mother Bunch,
      and she answered him with a forced smile. &ldquo;Can you be grieved at so
      small a thing? It was a habit, Agricola, from childhood. When did your
      good and affectionate mother, who nevertheless loved me as her daughter,
      ever call me anything else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did my mother consult you about my marriage, speak to you of
      the rare beauty of my bride, beg you to come and see her, and study her
      character, in the hope that the instinct of your affection for me would
      warn you&mdash;if I made a bad choice? Did my mother have this cruelty?&mdash;No;
      it was I, who thus pierced your heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fears of the hearer were again aroused; there could be but little
      doubt that Agricola knew her secret. She felt herself sinking with
      confusion; yet, making a last effort not to believe the discovery, she
      murmured in a feeble voice: &ldquo;True, Agricola! It was not your mother,
      but yourself, who made me that request&mdash;and I was grateful to you for
      such a mark of confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grateful, my poor girl!&rdquo; cried the smith, whilst his eyes
      filled with tears; &ldquo;no, it is not true. I pained you fearfully&mdash;I
      was merciless&mdash;heaven knows, without being aware of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the other, in a voice now almost unintelligible,
      &ldquo;what makes you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love for me!&rdquo; cried the smith, trembling with emotion,
      as he clasped Mother Bunch in a brotherly embrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh heaven!&rdquo; murmured the unfortunate creature, as she covered
      her face with her hands, &ldquo;he knows all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know all,&rdquo; resumed Agricola, with an expression of
      ineffable tenderness and respect: &ldquo;yes, I know all, and I will not
      have you blush for a sentiment, which honors me, and of which I feel so
      justly proud. Yes, I know all; and I say to myself with joy and pride,
      that the best, the most noble heart in the world is mine&mdash;will be
      mine always. Come, Magdalen; let us leave shame to evil passions. Raise
      your eyes, and look at me! You know, if my countenance was ever false&mdash;if
      it ever reflected a feigned emotion. Then look and tell me, if you cannot
      read in my features, how proud I am, Magdalen, how justly proud of your
      love!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Overwhelmed with grief and confusion, Mother Bunch had not dared to look
      on Agricola; but his words expressed so deep a conviction, the tones of
      his voice revealed so tender an emotion, that the poor creature felt her
      shame gradually diminish, particularly when Agricola added, with rising
      animation: &ldquo;Be satisfied, my sweet, my noble Magdalen; I will be
      worthy of this love. Believe me, it shall yet cause you as much happiness
      as it has occasioned tears. Why should this love be a motive for
      estrangement, confusion, fear? For what is love, in the sense in which it
      is held by your generous heart? Is it not a continual exchange of
      devotion, tenderness, esteem, of mutual and blind confidence?&mdash;Why,
      Magdalen! we may have all this for one another&mdash;devotion, tenderness,
      confidence&mdash;even more than in times past; for, on a thousand
      occasions, your secret inspired you with fear and suspicion&mdash;while,
      for the future, on the contrary, you will see me take such delight in the
      place I fill in your good and valiant heart, that you will be happy in the
      happiness you bestow. What I have just said may seem very selfish and
      conceited; so much the worse! I do not know how to lie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The longer the smith spoke, the less troubled became Mother Bunch. What
      she had above all feared in the discovery of her secret was to see it
      received with raillery, contempt, or humiliating compassion; far from
      this, joy and happiness were distinctly visible on the manly and honest
      face of Agricola. The hunchback knew him incapable of deception; therefore
      she exclaimed, this time without shame or confusion, but rather with a
      sort of pride.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30205.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every sincere and pure passion is so far good and con soling as to
      end by deserving interest and sympathy, when it has triumphed over its
      first excess! It is alike honorable to the heart which feels and that
      which inspires it!&mdash;Thanks to you, Agricola&mdash;thanks to the kind
      words, which have raised me in my own esteem&mdash;I feel that, instead of
      blushing, I ought to be proud of this love. My benefactress is right&mdash;you
      are right: why should I be ashamed of it? Is it not a true and sacred
      love? To be near you, to love you, to tell you so, to prove it by constant
      devotion, what did I ever desire more? And yet shame and fear, joined with
      that dizziness of the brain which extreme misery produces, drove me to
      suicide!&mdash;But then some allowance must be made for the suspicions of
      a poor creature, who has been the subject of ridicule from her cradle. So
      my secret was to die with me, unless some unforeseen accident should
      reveal it to you; and, in that case, you are right&mdash;sure of myself,
      sure of you, I ought to have feared nothing. But I may claim some
      indulgence; mistrust, cruel mistrust of one&rsquo;s self makes one doubt
      others also. Let us forget all that. Agricola, my generous brother, I will
      say to you, as you said to me just now, &lsquo;Look at me; you know my
      countenance cannot lie. Look at me: see if I shun your gaze; see if, ever
      in my life, I looked so happy&rsquo;&mdash;and yet, even now, I was about
      to die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke the truth. Agricola himself could not have hoped so prompt an
      effect from his words. In spite of the deep traces which misery, grief,
      and sickness had imprinted on the girl&rsquo;s features, they now shone
      with radiant happiness and serenity, whilst her blue eyes, gentle and pure
      as her soul, were fixed, without embarrassment, on those of Agricola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thanks, thanks!&rdquo; cried the smith, in a rapture of
      delight: &ldquo;when I see you so calm, and so happy, Magdalen, I am
      indeed grateful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am calm, I am happy,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;and happy I
      shall be, for I can now tell you my most secret thoughts. Yes, happy; for
      this day, which began so fatally, ends like a divine dream. Far from being
      afraid, I now look at you with hope and joy. I have again found my
      generous benefactress, and I am tranquil as to the fate of my poor sister.
      Oh! shall we not soon see her? I should like her to take part in this
      happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed so happy, that the smith did not dare to inform her of the
      death of Cephyse, and reserved himself to communicate the same at a more
      fitting opportunity. Therefore he answered: &ldquo;Cephyse, being the
      stronger, has been the more shaken; it will not be prudent, I am told, to
      see her to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait then. I can repress my impatience, I have so much to
      say to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, gentle Magdalen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend!&rdquo; cried the girl, interrupting Agricola, with
      tears of joy: &ldquo;I cannot tell you what I feel, when I hear you call
      me Magdalen. It is so sweet, so soothing, that my heart expands with
      delight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl! how dreadfully she must have suffered!&rdquo; cried the
      smith, with inexpressible emotion, &ldquo;when she displays so much
      happiness, so much gratitude, at being called by her own poor name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But consider, my friend; that word in your mouth contains a new
      life for me. If you only knew what hopes, what pleasures I can now see
      gleaming in the future! If you knew all the cherished longings of my
      tenderness! Your wife, the charming Angela, with her angel face and
      angel-soul&mdash;oh! in my turn, I can say to, you, &lsquo;Look at me, and
      see how sweet that name is to my lips and heart!&rsquo; Yes, your
      charming, your good Angela will call me Magdalen&mdash;and your children,
      Agricola, your children!&mdash;dear little creatures!&mdash;to them also I
      shall be Magdalen&mdash;their good Magdalen&mdash;and the love I shall
      bear them will make them mine, as well as their mother&rsquo;s&mdash;and I
      shall have my part in every maternal care&mdash;and they will belong to us
      three; will they not, Agricola?&mdash;Oh! let me, let me weep! These tears
      without bitterness do me so much good; they are tears that need not be
      concealed. Thank heaven! thank you, my friend! those other tears are I
      trust dried forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some seconds, this affecting scene had been overlooked by an invisible
      witness. The smith and Mother Bunch had not perceived Mdlle. de Cardoville
      standing on the threshold of the door. As Mother Bunch had said, this day,
      which dawned with all under such fatal auspices, had become for all a day
      of ineffable felicity. Adrienne, too, was full of joy, for Djalma had been
      faithful to her, Djalma loved her with passion. The odious appearances, of
      which she had been the dupe and victim, evidently formed part of a new
      plot of Rodin, and it only remained for Mdlle. de Cardoville to discover
      the end of these machinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another joy was reserved for her. The happy are quick in detecting
      happiness in others, and Adrienne guessed, by the hunchback&rsquo;s last
      words, that there was no longer any secret between the smith and the
      sempstress. She could not therefore help exclaiming, as she entered:
      &ldquo;Oh! this will be the brightest day of my life, for I shall not be
      happy alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola and Mother Bunch turned round hastily. &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said
      the smith, &ldquo;in spite of the promise I made you, I could not conceal
      from Magdalen that I knew she loved me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I no longer blush for this love before Agricola, why
      should I blush for it before you, lady, that told me to be proud of it,
      because it is noble and pure?&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, to whom her
      happiness gave strength enough to rise, and to lean upon Agricola&rsquo;s
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, my friend,&rdquo; said Adrienne, as she threw her arms
      round her to support her; &ldquo;only one word, to excuse the indiscretion
      with which you will perhaps reproach me. If I told your secret to M.
      Agricola&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why it was, Magdalen?&rdquo; cried the smith,
      interrupting Adrienne. &ldquo;It was only another proof of the lady&rsquo;s
      delicate generosity. &lsquo;I long hesitate to confide to you this secret,&rsquo;
      said she to me this morning, &lsquo;but I have at length made up my mind
      to it. We shall probably find your adopted sister; you have been to her
      the best of brothers: but many times, without knowing it, you have wounded
      her feelings cruelly&mdash;and now that you know her secret, I trust in
      your kind heart to keep it faithfully, and so spare the poor child a
      thousand pangs&mdash;pangs the more bitter, because they come from you,
      and are suffered in silence. Hence, when you speak to her of your wife,
      your domestic happiness, take care not to gall that noble and tender
      heart.&rsquo;&mdash;Yes, Magdalen, these were the reasons that led the
      lady to commit what she called an indiscretion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want words to thank you now and ever,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, my friend,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, &ldquo;how often the
      designs of the wicked turn against themselves. They feared your devotion
      to me, and therefore employed that unhappy Florine to steal your journal&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as to drive me from your house with shame, lady, When I supposed
      my most secret thoughts an object of ridicule to all. There can be no
      doubt such was their plan,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, my child. Well! this horrible wickedness, which nearly caused
      your death, now turns to the confusion of the criminals. Their plot is
      discovered&mdash;and, luckily, many other of their designs,&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, as she thought of Rose-Pompon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she resumed, with heartfelt joy: &ldquo;At last, we are again united,
      happier than ever, and in our very happiness we shall find new resources
      to combat our enemies. I say our enemies&mdash;for all that love me are
      odious to these wretches. But courage, the hour is come, and the good
      people will have their turn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven, lady,&rdquo; said the smith; &ldquo;or my part, I
      shall not be wanting in zeal. What delight to strip them of their mask!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me remind you, M. Baudoin, that you have an appointment for to
      morrow with M. Hardy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not forgotten it, lady, any more than the generous offers I
      am to convey to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing. He belongs to my family. Tell him (what indeed I
      shall write to him this evening), that the funds necessary to reopen his
      factory are at his disposal; I do not say so for his sake only, but for
      that of a hundred families reduced to want. Beg him to quit immediately
      the fatal abode to which they have taken him: for a thousand reasons he
      should be on his guard against all that surround him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied, lady. The letter he wrote to me in reply to the one I
      got secretly delivered to him, was short, affectionate, sad&mdash;but he
      grants me the interview I had asked for, and I am sure I shall be able to
      persuade him to leave that melancholy dwelling, and perhaps to depart with
      me, he has always had so much confidence in my attachment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M. Baudoin, courage!&rdquo; said Adrienne, as she threw her
      cloak over the workgirl&rsquo;s shoulders, and wrapped her round with
      care. &ldquo;Let us be gone, for it is late. As soon as we get home, I
      will give you a letter for M. Hardy, and to-morrow you will come and tell
      me the result of your visit. No, not to-morrow,&rdquo; she added, blushing
      slightly. &ldquo;Write to me to-morrow, and the day after, about twelve,
      come to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes later, the young sempstress, supported by Agricola and
      Adrienne, had descended the stairs of that gloomy house, and, being placed
      in the carriage by the side of Mdlle. de Cardoville, she earnestly
      entreated to be allowed to see Cephyse; it was in vain that Agricola
      assured her it was impossible, and that she should see her the next day.
      Thanks to the information derived from Rose-Pompon, Mdlle. de Cardoville
      was reasonably suspicious of all those who surrounded Djalma, and she
      therefore took measures, that, very evening, to have a letter delivered to
      the prince by what she considered a sure hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE TWO CARRIAGES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is the evening
      of the day on which Mdlle. de Cardoville prevented the sewing-girl&rsquo;s
      suicide. It strikes eleven; the night is dark; the wind blows with
      violence, and drives along great black clouds, which completely hide the
      pale lustre of the moon. A hackney-coach, drawn by two broken-winded
      horses, ascends slowly and with difficulty the slope of the Rue Blanche,
      which is pretty steep near the barrier, in the part where is situated the
      house occupied by Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach stops. The coachman, cursing the length of an interminable drive
      &ldquo;within the circuit,&rdquo; leading at last to this difficult
      ascent, turns round on his box, leans over towards the front window of the
      vehicle, and says in a gruff tone to the person he is driving: &ldquo;Come!
      are we almost there? From the Rue de Vaugirard to the Barriere Blanche, is
      a pretty good stretch, I think, without reckoning that the night is so
      dark, that one can hardly see two steps before one&mdash;and the
      street-lamps not lighted because of the moon, which doesn&rsquo;t shine,
      after all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for a little door with a portico-drive on about twenty
      yards beyond&mdash;and then stop close to the wall,&rdquo; answered a
      squeaking voice, impatiently, and with an Italian accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a beggarly Dutchman, that will make me as savage as a bear?&rdquo;
      muttered the angry Jehu to himself. Then he added: &ldquo;Thousand
      thunders! I tell you that I can&rsquo;t see. How the devil can I find out
      your little door?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no sense? Follow the wall to the right, brush against it,
      and you will easily find the little door. It is next to No. 50. If you do
      not find it, you must be drunk,&rdquo; answered the Italian, with
      increased bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman only replied by swearing like a trooper, and whipping up his
      jaded horses. Then, keeping close to the wall, he strained his eyes in
      trying to read the numbers of the houses, by the aid of his carriage
      lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some moments, the coach again stopped. &ldquo;I have passed No. 50,
      and here is a little door with a portico,&rdquo; said the coachman.
      &ldquo;Is that the one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Now go forward some twenty
      yards, and then stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I never&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get down from your box, and give twice three knocks at the
      little door we have just passed&mdash;you understand me?&mdash;twice three
      knocks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you give me to drink?&rdquo; cried the exasperated
      coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have taken me back to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where I
      live, you shall have something handsome, if you do but manage matters
      well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! now the Faubourg Saint-Germain! Only that little bit of
      distance!&rdquo; said the driver, with repressed rage. &ldquo;And I who
      have winded my horses, wanted to be on the boulevard by the time the play
      was out. Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; Then, putting a good face on his
      bad luck, and consoling himself with the thought of the promised
      drink-money, he resumed: &ldquo;I am to give twice three knocks at the
      little door?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; three knocks first&mdash;then pause&mdash;then three other
      knocks. Do you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the person who comes, that he is waited for, and bring him
      here to the coach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil burn you!&rdquo; said the coachman to himself, as he
      turned round on the box, and whipped up his horses, adding: &ldquo;this
      crusty old Dutchman has something to do with Free-masons, or, perhaps,
      smugglers, seeing we are so near the gates. He deserves my giving him in
      charge, for bringing me all the way from the Rue de Vaugirard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At twenty steps beyond the little door, the coach again stopped, and the
      coachman descended from the box to execute the orders he had received.
      Going to the little door, he knocked three times; then paused, as he had
      been desired, and then knocked three times more. The clouds, which had
      hitherto been so thick as entirely to conceal the disk of the moon, just
      then withdrew sufficiently to afford a glimmering light, so that when the
      door opened at the signal, the coachman saw a middle-sized person issue
      from it, wrapped in a cloak, and wearing a colored cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man carefully locked the door, and then advanced two steps into the
      street. &ldquo;They are waiting for you,&rdquo; said the coachman; &ldquo;I
      am to take you along with me to the coach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Preceding the man with the cloak, who only answered him by a nod, he led
      him to the coach-door, which he was about to open, and to let down the
      step, when the voice exclaimed from the inside: &ldquo;It is not
      necessary. The gentleman may talk to me through the window. I will call
      you when it is time to start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means that I shall be kept here long enough to send you to
      all the devils!&rdquo; murmured the driver. &ldquo;However, I may as well
      walk about, just to stretch my legs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he began to walk up and down, by the side of the wall in which
      was the little door. Presently he heard the distant sound of wheels, which
      soon came nearer and nearer, and a carriage, rapidly ascending the slope,
      stopped on the other side of the little garden-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I say! a private carriage!&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;Good
      horses those, to come up the Rue Blanche at a trot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman was just making this observation, when, by favor of a
      momentary gleam of light, he saw a man step from the carriage, advance
      rapidly to the little door, open it, and go in, closing it after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gets thicker and thicker!&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;One
      comes out, and the other goes in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he walked up to the carriage. It was splendidly harnessed, and
      drawn by two handsome and vigorous horses. The driver sat motionless, in
      his great box-coat, with the handle of his whip resting on his right knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s weather to drive about in, with such tidy dukes as
      yours, comrade!&rdquo; said the humble hackney-coachman to this automaton,
      who remained mute and impassible, without even appearing to know that he
      was spoken to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand French&mdash;he&rsquo;s an Englishman.
      One could tell that by his horses,&rdquo; said the coachman, putting this
      interpretation on the silence of his brother whip. Then, perceiving a tall
      footman at a little distance, dressed in a long gray livery coat, with
      blue collar and silver buttons, the coachman addressed himself to him, by
      way of compensation, but without much varying his phrase: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      nice weather to stand about in, comrade!&rdquo; On the part of the
      footman, he was met with the same imperturbable silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both Englishmen,&rdquo; resumed the coachman,
      philosophically; and, though somewhat astonished at the incident of the
      little door, he recommenced his walk in the direction of his own vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these facts were passing, the man in the cloak, and the man with the
      Italian accent continued their conversation, the one still in the coach,
      and the other leaning with his hand on the door. It had already lasted for
      some time, and was carried on in Italian. They were evidently talking of
      some absent person, as will appear from the following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the voice from the coach, &ldquo;that is agreed to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; answered the man in the cloak; &ldquo;but only
      in case the eagle should become a serpent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in the contrary event, you will receive the other half of the
      ivory crucifix I gave you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall know what it means, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continue to merit and preserve his confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will merit and preserve it, my lord, because I admire and respect
      this man, who is stronger than the strongest, by craft, and courage, and
      will. I have knelt before him with humility, as I would kneel before one
      of the three black idols that stand between Bowanee and her worshippers;
      for his religion, like mine, teaches to change life into nothingness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the voice, in a tone of some embarrassment;
      &ldquo;these comparisons are useless and inaccurate. Only think of obeying
      him, without explaining your obedience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him speak, and I perform his will! I am in his hands like a
      corpse, as he himself expresses it. He has seen, he sees every day, my
      devotion to his interests with regard to Prince Djalma. He has only to
      say: &lsquo;Kill him!&rsquo; and this son of a king&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s salve, do not have such ideas!&rdquo; cried the
      voice, interrupting the man in the cloak. &ldquo;Thank heaven, you will
      never be asked for such proofs of your submission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I am ordered I do. Bowanee sees me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt your zeal. I know that you are a loving and
      intelligent barrier, placed between the prince and many guilty interests;
      and it is because I have heard of that zeal, of your skill in
      circumventing this young Indian, and, above all, of the motives of your
      blind devotion, that I have wished to inform you of everything. You are
      the fanatical worshipper of him you serve. That is well; man should be the
      obedient slave of the god he chooses for himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord; so long as the god remains a god.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We understand each other perfectly. As for your recompense, you
      know what I have promised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I have my reward already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Then as for secrecy&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have securities, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and sufficient ones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The interest of the cause I serve, my lord, would alone be enough
      to secure my zeal and discretion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; you are a man of firm and ardent convictions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I strive to be so, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after all, a very religious man in your way. It is very
      praiseworthy, in these irreligious times, to have any views at all on such
      matters&mdash;particularly when those views will just enable me to count
      upon your aid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may count upon it, my lord, for the same reason that the
      intrepid hunter prefers a jackal to ten foxes, a tiger to ten jackals, a
      lion to ten tigers, and the welmiss to ten lions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the welmiss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what spirit is to matter, the blade to the scabbard, the
      perfume to the flower, the head to the body.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. There never was a more just comparison. You are a man
      of sound judgment. Always recollect what you have just told me, and make
      yourself more and more worthy of the confidence of&mdash;your idol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he soon be in a state to hear me, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two or three days, at most. Yesterday a providential crisis
      saved his life; and he is endowed with so energetic a will, that his cure
      will be very rapid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you see him again to-morrow, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, before my departure, to bid him farewell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell him a strange circumstance, of which I have not been able
      to inform him, but which happened yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had gone to the garden of the dead. I saw funerals everywhere,
      and lighted torches, in the midst of the black night, shining upon tombs.
      Bowanee smiled in her ebon sky. As I thought of that divinity of
      destruction, I beheld with joy the dead-cart emptied of its coffins. The
      immense pit yawned like the mouth of hell; corpses were heaped upon
      corpses, and still it yawned the same. Suddenly, by the light of a torch,
      I saw an old man beside me. He wept. I had seen him before. He is a Jew&mdash;the
      keeper of the house in the Rue Saint-Francois&mdash;you know what I mean.&rdquo;
      Here the man in the cloak started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but what is the matter? why do you stop short?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because in that house there has been for a hundred and fifty years
      the portrait of a man whom I once met in the centre of India, on the banks
      of the Ganges.&rdquo; And the man in the cloak again paused and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A singular resemblance, no doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord, a singular resemblance&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Jew&mdash;the old Jew?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to that, my lord. Still weeping, he said to a
      gravedigger, &lsquo;Well! and the coffin?&rsquo; &lsquo;You were right,&rsquo;
      answered the man; &lsquo;I found it in the second row of the other grave.
      It had the figure of a cross on it, formed by seven black nails. But how
      could you know the place and the mark?&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas! it is no
      matter,&rsquo; replied the old Jew, with bitter melancholy. &lsquo;You see
      that I was but too well informed on the subject. But where is the coffin?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Behind the great tomb of black marble; I have hidden it there. So
      make haste; for, in the confusion, nothing will be noticed. You have paid
      me well, and I wish you to succeed in what you require.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did the old Jew do with the coffin marked with the seven
      black nails?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men accompanied him, my lord, bearing a covered litter, with
      curtains drawn round it. He lighted a lantern, and, followed by these two
      men, went towards the place pointed out by the gravedigger. A stoppage,
      occasioned by the dead-carts, made me lose sight of the old Jew, whom I
      was following amongst the tombs. Afterwards I was unable to find him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed a strange affair. What could this old Jew want with
      the coffin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is said, my lord, that they use dead bodies in preparing their
      magic charms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those unbelievers are capable of anything&mdash;even of holding
      communication with the Enemy of mankind. However, we will look after this:
      the discovery may be of importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a clock struck twelve in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Midnight! already?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be gone. Good-bye&mdash;but for the last time swear to me
      that, should matters so turn out, as soon as you receive the other half of
      the ivory crucifix I have just given you, you will keep your promise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sworn it by Bowanee, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that, to make all sure, the person who will
      deliver to you the other half of the crucifix is to say&mdash;come, what
      is he to say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is to say, my lord: &lsquo;There is many a slip &lsquo;twixt the
      cup and the lip.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Adieu! secrecy and fidelity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secrecy and fidelity, my lord,&rdquo; answered the man in the
      cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some seconds after the hackney-coach started, carrying with it Cardinal
      Malipieri, one of the speakers in the above dialogue. The other, whom the
      reader has no doubt recognized as Faringhea, returned to the little
      garden-door of the house occupied by Djalma. At the moment he was putting
      the key into the lock, the door opened, to his great astonishment, and a
      man came forth. Faringhea rushed upon the unknown, seized him violently by
      the collar, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Who are you? whence came you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger evidently found the tone of this question anything but
      satisfactory; for, instead of answering, he struggled to disengage himself
      from Faringhea&rsquo;s hold, and cried out, in a loud voice: &ldquo;Help!
      Peter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the carriage, which had been standing a few yards off, dashed up
      at full speed, and Peter, the tall footman, seizing the half-breed by the
      shoulders, flung him back several paces, and thus made a seasonable
      diversion in favor of the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; said the latter to Faringhea, shaking himself, and
      still protected by the gigantic footman, &ldquo;I am in a state to answer
      your questions, though you certainly have a very rough way of receiving an
      old acquaintance. I am Dupont, ex-bailiff of the estate of Cardoville, and
      it was I who helped to fish you out of the water, when the ship was
      wrecked in which you had embarked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the carriage-lamps, indeed, the half-caste recognized the
      good, honest face of Dupont, formerly bailiff, and now house-steward, to
      Mdlle. de Cardoville. It must not be forgotten that Dupont had been the
      first to write to Mdlle. de Cardoville, to ask her to interest herself for
      Djalma, who was then detained at Cardoville Castle by the injuries he had
      received during the shipwreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, what is your business here? Why do you introduce yourself
      clandestinely into this house?&rdquo; said Faringhea, in an abrupt and
      suspicious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;just observe to you that there is nothing clandestine
      in the matter. I came here in a carriage, with servants in the livery of
      my excellent mistress, Mdlle. de Cardoville, charged by her, without any
      disguise or mystery, to deliver a letter to Prince Djalma, her cousin,&rdquo;
      replied Dupont, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these words, Faringhea trembled with mute rage, as he answered: &ldquo;And
      why, sir, come at this late hour, and introduce yourself by this little
      door?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came at this hour, my dear sir, because such was Mdlle. de
      Cardoville&rsquo;s command, and I entered by this little gate because
      there is every reason to believe that if I had gone around to the other I
      should not have been permitted to see the prince.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; replied the half-caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible: but as we knew that the prince usually passed a
      good portion of the night in the little saloon, which communicates with
      the greenhouse, and as Mdlle. de Cardoville had kept a duplicate key of
      this door, I was pretty certain, by taking this course, to be able to
      deliver into the prince&rsquo;s own hands the letter from Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, his cousin, which I have now had the honor of doing, my dear
      sir; and I have been deeply touched by the kindness with which the prince
      deigned to receive me and to remember our last interview.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who kept you so well informed, sir, of the prince&rsquo;s
      habits?&rdquo; said Faringhea, unable to control his vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have been well informed as to his habits, my dear sir, I have
      had no such correct knowledge of yours,&rdquo; answered Dupont, with a
      mocking air; &ldquo;for I assure you that I had no more notion of seeing
      you than you had of seeing me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, M. Dupont bowed with something like mock politeness to the
      half-caste, and got into the carriage, which drove off rapidly, leaving
      Faringhea in a state of the utmost surprise and anger.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. THE APPOINTMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he morning after&mdash;Dupont&rsquo;s
      mission to Prince Djalma, the latter was walking with hasty and impatient
      step up and down the little saloon, which communicated, as we already
      know, with the greenhouse from which Adrienne had entered when she first
      appeared to him. In remembrance of that day, he had chosen to dress
      himself as on the occasion in question; he wore the same tunic of white
      cashmere, with a cherry-colored turban, to match with his girdle; his
      gaiters, of scarlet velvet, embroidered with silver, displayed the fine
      form of his leg, and terminated in small white morocco slippers, with red
      heels. Happiness has so instantaneous, and, as it were, material an
      influence upon young, lively, and ardent natures, that Djalma, dejected
      and despairing only the day before, was no longer like the same person.
      The pale, transparent gold of his complexion was no longer tarnished by a
      livid hue. His large eyes, of late obscured like black diamonds by a humid
      vapor, now shone with mild radiance in the centre of their pearly setting;
      his lips, long pale, had recovered their natural color, which was rich and
      soft as the fine purple flowers of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever and anon, pausing in his hasty walk, he stopped suddenly, and drew
      from his bosom a little piece of paper, carefully folded, which he pressed
      to his lips with enthusiastic ardor. Then, unable to restrain the
      expression of his full happiness, he uttered a full and sonorous cry of
      joy, and with a bound he was in front of the plate-glass which separated
      the saloon from the conservatory, in which he had first seen Mdlle. de
      Cardoville. By a singular power of remembrance, or marvellous
      hallucination of a mind possessed by a fixed idea, Djalma had often seen,
      or fancied he saw, the adored semblance of Adrienne appear to him through
      this sheet of crystal. The illusion had been so complete, that, with his
      eyes ardently fixed on the vision he invoked, he had been able, with the
      aid of a pencil dipped in carmine, to trace with astonishing exactness,
      the profile of the ideal countenance which the delirium of his imagination
      had presented to his view.(42) It was before these delicate lines of
      bright carmine that Djalma now stood in deep contemplation, after perusing
      and reperusing, and raising twenty times to his lips, the letter he had
      received the night before from the hands of Dupont. Djalma was not alone.
      Faringhea watched all the movements of the prince, with a subtle,
      attentive, and gloomy aspect. Standing respectfully in a corner of the
      saloon, the half-caste appeared to be occupied in unfolding and spreading
      out Djalma&rsquo;s sash, light, silky Indian web, the brown ground of
      which was almost entirely concealed by the exquisite gold and silver
      embroidery with which it was overlaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of the half-caste wore a dark and gloomy expression. He
      could not deceive himself. The letter from Mdlle. de Cardoville, delivered
      by Dupont to Djalma, must have been the cause of the delight he now
      experienced, for, without doubt, he knew himself beloved. In that event,
      his obstinate silence towards Faringhea, ever since the latter had entered
      the saloon, greatly alarmed the half-caste, who could not tell what
      interpretation to put upon it. The night before, after parting with
      Dupont, he had hastened, in a state of anxiety easily understood, to look
      for the prince, in the hope of ascertaining the effect produced by Mdlle.
      de Cardoville&rsquo;s letter. But he found the parlor door closed, and
      when he knocked, he received no answer from within. Then, though the night
      was far advanced, he had dispatched a note to Rodin, in which he informed
      him of Dupont&rsquo;s visit and its probable intention. Djalma had indeed
      passed the night in a tumult of happiness and hope, and a fever of
      impatience quite impossible to describe. Repairing to his bed-chamber only
      towards the morning, he had taken a few moments of repose, and had then
      dressed himself without assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times, but in vain, the half-caste had discreetly knocked at the door
      of Djalma&rsquo;s apartment. It was only in the early part of the
      afternoon that the prince had rung the bell to order his carriage to be
      ready by half-past two. Faringhea having presented himself, the prince had
      given him the order without looking at him, as he might have done to any
      other of his servants. Was this suspicion, aversion, or mere absence of
      mind on the part of Djalma? Such were the questions which the half caste
      put to himself with growing anguish; for the designs of which he was the
      most active and immediate instrument might all be ruined by the least
      suspicion in the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the hours&mdash;the hours&mdash;how slow they are!&rdquo; cried
      the young Indian, suddenly, in a low and trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before yesterday, my lord, you said the hours were very
      long,&rdquo; observed Faringhea, as he drew near Djalma in order to
      attract his attention. Seeing that he did not succeed in this he advanced
      a few steps nearer, and resumed: &ldquo;Your joy seems very great, my
      lord; tell the cause of it to your poor and faithful servant, that he also
      may rejoice with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30215.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      If he heard the words, Djalma did not pay any attention to them. He made
      no answer, and his large black eyes gazed upon vacancy. He seemed to smile
      admiringly upon some enchanting vision, and he folded his two hands upon
      his bosom, in the attitude which his countrymen assume at the hour of
      prayer. After some instants of contemplation, he said: &ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock
      is it?&rdquo;&mdash;but he asked this question of himself, rather than of
      any third person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will soon be two o&rsquo;clock, my lord,&rdquo; said Faringhea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having heard this answer, Djalma seated himself, and hid his face in his
      hands, as if completely absorbed in some ineffable meditation. Urged on by
      his growing anxiety, and wishing at any cost to attract the attention of
      Djalma, Faringhea approached still nearer to him, and, almost certain of
      the effect of the words he was about to utter, said to him in a slow and
      emphatic voice: &ldquo;My lord, I am sure that you owe the happiness which
      now transports you to Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had this name been pronounced, than Djalma started from his chair,
      looked the half-breed full in the face, and exclaimed, as if only just
      aware of his presence, &ldquo;Faringhea! you here!&mdash;what is the
      matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your faithful servant shares in your joy, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What joy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which the letter of Mdlle. de Cardoville has occasioned, my
      lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma returned no answer, but his eye shone with so much serene
      happiness, that the half-caste recovered from his apprehensions. No cloud
      of doubt or suspicion obscured the radiant features of the prince. After a
      few moments of silence, Djalma fixed upon the half-caste a look
      half-veiled with a tear of joy, and said to him, with the expression of
      one whose heart overflows with love and happiness: &ldquo;Oh! such delight
      is good&mdash;great&mdash;like heaven!&mdash;for it is heaven which&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve this happiness, my lord, after so many sufferings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sufferings?&mdash;Oh! yes. I formerly suffered at Java; but
      that was years ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, this great good fortune does not astonish me. What have I
      always told you? Do not despair; feign a violent passion for some other
      woman, and then this proud young lady&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Djalma looked at the half-caste with so piercing a glance,
      that the latter stopped short; but the prince said to him with
      affectionate goodness, &ldquo;Go on! I listen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, leaning his chin upon his hand, and his elbow on his knee, he gazed
      so intently on Faringhea, and yet with such unutterable mildness, that
      even that iron soul was touched for a moment with a slight feeling of
      remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying, my lord,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that by following
      the counsels of your faithful slave, who persuaded you to feign a
      passionate love for another woman, you have brought the proud Mdlle. de
      Cardoville to come to you. Did I not tell you it would be so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did tell me so,&rdquo; answered Djalma, still maintaining
      the same position, and examining the half-caste with the same fixed and
      mild attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise of Faringhea increased; generally, the prince, without
      treating him with the least harshness, preserved the somewhat distant and
      imperious manners of their common country, and he had never before spoken
      to him with such extreme mildness. Knowing all the evil he had done the
      prince, and suspicious as the wicked must ever be, the half-caste thought
      for a moment, that his master&rsquo;s apparent kindness might conceal a
      snare. He continued, therefore, with less assurance, &ldquo;Believe me, my
      lord, this day, if you do but know how to profit by your advantages, will
      console you for all your troubles, which have indeed been great&mdash;for
      only yesterday, though you were generous enough to forget it, only
      yesterday you suffered cruelly&mdash;but you were not alone in your
      sufferings. This proud young lady suffered also!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is quite sure, my lord. What must she not have felt, when
      she saw you at the theatre with another woman!&mdash;If she loved you only
      a little, she must have been deeply wounded in her self-esteem; if she
      loved you with passion, she must have been struck to the heart. At length,
      you see, wearied out with suffering, she has come to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, any way, she must have suffered&mdash;and that does not
      move your pity?&rdquo; said Djalma, in a constrained, but still very mild
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before thinking of others, my lord, I think of your distresses; and
      they touch me too nearly to leave me any pity for other woes,&rdquo; added
      Faringhea hypocritically, so greatly had the influence of Rodin already
      modified the character of the Phansegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange!&rdquo; said Djalma, speaking to himself, as he
      viewed the half caste with a glance still kind but piercing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is strange, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. But tell me, since your advice has hitherto prospered so
      well, what think you of the future?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the future, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in an hour I shall be with Mdlle. de Cardoville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a serious matter, my lord. The whole future will depend
      upon this interview.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I was just thinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, my lord, women never love any so well, as the bold man
      who spares them the embarrassment of a refusal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain more fully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lord, they despise the timid and languishing lover, who
      asks humbly for what he might take by force.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to-day I shall meet Mdlle. de Cardoville for the first time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have met her a thousand times in your dreams, my lord; and
      depend upon it, she has seen you also in her dreams, since she loves you.
      Every one of your amorous thoughts has found an echo in her heart. All
      your ardent adorations have been responded to by her. Love has not two
      languages, and, without meeting, you have said all that you had to say to
      each other. Now, it is for you to act as her master, and she will be yours
      entirely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange&mdash;very strange!&rdquo; said Djalma, a second
      time, without removing his eyes from Faringhea&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistaking the sense which the prince attached to these words, the half
      caste resumed: &ldquo;Believe me, my lord, however strange it may appear,
      this is the wisest course. Remember the past. Was it by playing the part
      of a timid lover that you have brought to your feet this proud young lady,
      my lord? No, it was by pretending to despise her, in favor of another
      woman. Therefore, let us have no weakness. The lion does not woo like the
      poor turtle-dove. What cares the sultan of the desert for a few plaintive
      howls from the lioness, who is more pleased than angry at his rude and
      wild caresses? Soon submissive, fearful and happy, she follows in the
      track of her master. Believe me, my lord&mdash;try everything&mdash;dare
      everything&mdash;and to-day you will become the adored sultan of this
      young lady, whose beauty all Paris admires.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes&rsquo; silence, Djalma, shaking his head with an
      expression of tender pity, said to the half-caste, in his mild, sonorous
      voice: &ldquo;Why betray me thus? Why advise me thus wickedly to use
      violence, terror, and surprise, towards an angel of purity, whom I respect
      as my mother? Is it not enough for you to have been so long devoted to my
      enemies, whose hatred has followed me from Java?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Djalma sprung upon the half-caste with bloodshot eye, menacing brow,
      and lifted poniard, the latter would have been less surprised, and perhaps
      less frightened, than when he heard the prince speak of his treachery in
      this tone of mild reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back hastily, as if about to stand on his guard. But Djalma
      resumed, with the same gentleness, &ldquo;Fear nothing. Yesterday I should
      have killed you! But to-day happy love renders me too just, too merciful
      for that. I pity you, without any feeling of bitterness&mdash;for you must
      have been very unhappy, or you could not have become so wicked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord!&rdquo; said the half-caste, with growing amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must have suffered much, and met with little mercy, poor
      creature, to have become so merciless, in your hate, and proof against the
      sight of a happiness like mine. When I listened to you just now, and saw
      the sad perseverance of your hatred, I felt the deepest commiseration for
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, my lord&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; stammered the
      half-caste, and was unable to find words to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now&mdash;what harm have I ever done you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, my lord,&rdquo; answered Faringhea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you hate me thus? why pursue me with so much animosity?
      Was it not enough to give me the perfidious counsel to feign a shameful
      love for the young girl that was brought hither, and who quitted the house
      disgusted at the miserable part she was to play?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your feigned love for that young girl, my lord,&rdquo; replied
      Faringhea, gradually recovering his presence of mind, &ldquo;conquered the
      coldness of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say that,&rdquo; resumed the prince, interrupting him with
      the same mildness. &ldquo;If I enjoy this happiness, which makes me
      compassionate towards you, and raises me above myself, it is because Mdlle
      de Cardoville now knows that I have never for a moment ceased to love her
      as she ought to be loved, with adoration and reverence. It was your
      intention to have parted us forever, and you had nearly succeeded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think this of me, my lord, you must look upon me as your
      most mortal enemy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, I tell you. I have no right to blame you. In the
      madness of my grief, I listened to you and followed your advice. I was not
      only your dupe, but your accomplice. Only confess that, when you saw me at
      your mercy, dejected, crushed, despairing, it was cruel in you to advise
      the course that might have been most fatal to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ardor of my zeal may have deceived me, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to believe it. And yet again to-day there were the
      same evil counsels. You had no more pity for my happiness than for my
      sorrow. The rapture of my heart inspires you with only one desire&mdash;that
      of changing this rapture into despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, my lord!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you. It was your intention to ruin me&mdash;to dishonor me
      forever in the eyes of Mdlle. de Cardoville. Now, tell me&mdash;why this
      furious hate? what have I done to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misjudge me, my lord&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me. I do not wish you to be any longer wicked and
      treacherous. I wish to make you good. In our country, they charm serpents,
      and tame the wildest tigers. You are a man, with a mind to reason, a heart
      to love, and I will tame you too by gentleness. This day has bestowed on
      me divine happiness; you shall have good cause to bless this day. What can
      I do for you? what would you have&mdash;gold? You shall have it. Do you
      desire more than gold? Do you desire a friend, to console you for the
      sorrows that made you wicked, and to teach you to be good? Though a king&rsquo;s
      son, I will be that friend&mdash;in spite of the evil&mdash;ay, because of
      the evil you have done me. Yes; I will be your sincere friend, and it
      shall be my delight to say to myself: &lsquo;The day on which I learned
      that my angel loved me, my happiness was great indeed&mdash;for, in the
      morning, I had an implacable enemy, and, ere night, his hatred was changed
      to friendship.&rsquo; Believe me, Faringhea, misery makes crime, but
      happiness produces virtue. Be happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the clock struck two. The prince started. It was time to go
      on his visit to Adrienne. The handsome countenance of Djalma, doubly
      embellished by the mild, ineffable expression with which it had been
      animated whilst he was talking to the half-caste, now seemed illumined
      with almost divine radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching Faringhea, he extended his hand with the utmost, grace and
      courtesy, saying to him, &ldquo;Your hand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-caste, whose brow was bathed with a cold sweat, whose countenance
      was pale and agitated, seemed to hesitate for an instant; then, overawed,
      conquered, fascinated, he offered his trembling hand to the prince, who
      pressed it, and said to him, in their country&rsquo;s fashion, &ldquo;You
      have laid your hand honestly in a friend&rsquo;s; this hand shall never be
      closed against you. Faringhea, farewell! I now feel myself more worthy to
      kneel before my angel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Djalma went out, on his way to the appointment with Adrienne. In spite
      of his ferocity, in spite of the pitiless hate he bore to the whole human
      race, the dark sectary of Bowanee was staggered by the noble and clement
      words of Djalma, and said to himself, with terror, &ldquo;I have taken his
      hand. He is now sacred for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, a thought occurred to him, and he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but he will not be sacred for him who,
      according to the answer of last night, waits for him at the door of the
      house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the half-caste hastened into the next room, which looked upon
      the street, and, raising a corner of the curtain, muttered anxiously to
      himself, &ldquo;The carriage moves off&mdash;the man approaches.
      Perdition! it is gone and I see no more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. ANXIETY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>y a singular
      coincidence of ideas, Adrienne, like Djalma, had wished to be dressed
      exactly in the same costume as at their interview in the house in the Rue
      Blanche. For the site of this solemn meeting, so important to her future
      happiness, Adrienne had chosen, with habitual tact, the grand drawing-room
      of Cardoville House, in which hung many family portraits. The most
      apparent were those of her father and mother. The room was large and
      lofty, and furnished, like those which preceded it, with all the imposing
      splendor of the age of Louis XIV. The ceiling, painted by Lebrun, to
      represent the Triumph of Apollo, displayed his bold designing and vigorous
      coloring, in the centre of a wide cornice, magnificently carved and gilt,
      and supported at its angles by four large gilt figures, representing the
      Seasons. Huge panels, covered with crimson damask, and set in frames,
      served as the background to the family portraits which adorned this
      apartment. It is easier to conceive than describe the thousand conflicting
      emotions which agitated the bosom of Mdlle. de Cardoville as the moment
      approached for her interview with Djalma. Their meeting had been hitherto
      prevented by so many painful obstacles, and Adrienne was so well aware of
      the vigilant and active perfidy of her enemies, that even now she doubted
      of her happiness. Every instant, in spite of herself, her eyes wandered to
      the clock. A few minutes more, and the hour of the appointment would
      strike. It struck at last. Every reverberation was echoed from the depth
      of Adrienne&rsquo;s heart. She considered that Djalma&rsquo;s modest
      reserve had, doubtless, prevented his coming before the moment fixed by
      herself. Far from blaming this discretion, she fully appreciated it. But,
      from that moment, at the least noise in the adjoining apartments, she held
      her breath and listened with the anxiety of expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few minutes which followed the hour at which she expected
      Djalma, Mdlle. de Cardoville felt no serious apprehension, and calmed her
      impatience by the notion (which appears childish enough to those who have
      never known the feverish agitation of waiting for a happy meeting), that
      perhaps the clocks in the Rue Blanche might vary a little from those in
      the Rue d&rsquo;Anjou. But when this supposed variation, conceivable
      enough in itself, could no longer explain a delay of a quarter of an hour,
      of twenty minutes, of more, Adrienne felt her anxiety gradually increase.
      Two or three times the young girl rose, with palpitating heart, and went
      on tip-toe to listen at the door of the saloon. She heard nothing. The
      clock struck half-past three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to suppress her growing terror, and clinging to a last hope,
      Adrienne returned towards the fireplace and rang the bell. After which she
      endeavored to compose her features, so as to betray no outward sign of
      emotion. In a few seconds, a gray-haired footman, dressed in black, opened
      the door, and waited in respectful silence for the orders of his mistress.
      The latter said to him, in a calm voice, &ldquo;Andrew, request Hebe to
      give you the smelling bottle that I left on the chimney-piece in my room,
      and bring it me here.&rdquo; Andrew bowed; but just as he was about to
      withdraw to execute Adrienne&rsquo;s orders, which was only a pretext to
      enable her to ask a question without appearing to attach much importance
      to it in her servant&rsquo;s eyes, already informed of the expected visit
      of the prince, Mdlle. de Cardoville added, with an air of indifference.
      &ldquo;Pray, is that clock right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew drew out his watch, and replied as he cast his eyes upon it,
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle. I set my watch by the Tuileries. It is more than
      half past three.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;thank you!&rdquo; said Adrienne kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew again bowed; but, before going out, he said to Adrienne, &ldquo;I
      forgot to tell you, lady, that Marshal Simon called about an hour ago;
      but, as you were only to be at home to Prince Djalma, we told him that you
      received no company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Adrienne. With another low bow, Andrew
      quitted the room, and all returned to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the precise reason that, up to the last minute of the hour previous to
      the time fixed for her interview with Djalma, the hopes of Adrienne had
      not been disturbed by the slightest shadow of doubt, the disappointment
      she now felt was the more dreadful. Casting a desponding look at one of
      the portraits placed above her, she murmured, with a plaintive and
      despairing accent, &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Mdlle. de Cardoville uttered the words than the windows were
      slightly shaken by a carriage rolling into the courtyard. The young lady
      started, and was unable to repress a low cry of joy. Her heart bounded at
      the thought of meeting Djalma, for this time she felt that he was really
      come. She was quite as certain of it as if she had seen him. She resumed
      her seat and brushed away a tear suspended from her long eyelashes. Her
      hand trembled like a leaf. The sound of several doors opening and shutting
      proved that the young lady was right in her conjecture. The gilded panels
      of the drawing-room door soon turned upon their hinges, and the prince
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a second footman ushered in Djalma, Andrew placed on a gilded table,
      within reach of his mistress, a little silver salver, on which stood the
      crystal smelling-bottle. Then he withdrew, and the door of the room was
      closed. The prince and Mdlle. de Cardoville were left alone together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. ADRIENNE AND DJALMA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he prince had
      slowly approached Mdlle. de Cardoville. Notwithstanding the impetuosity of
      the Oriental&rsquo;s passions, his uncertain and timid step&mdash;timid,
      yet graceful&mdash;betrayed his profound emotion. He did not venture to
      lift his eyes to Adrienne&rsquo;s face; he had suddenly become very pale,
      and his finely formed hands, folded over his bosom in the attitude of
      adoration, trembled violently. With head bent down, he remained standing
      at a little distance from Adrienne. This embarrassment, ridiculous in any
      other person, appeared touching in this prince of twenty years of age,
      endowed with an almost fabulous intrepidity, and of so heroic and generous
      a character, that no traveller could speak of the son of Kadja sing
      without a tribute of admiration and respect. Sweet emotion! chaste
      reserve! doubly interesting if we consider that the burning passions of
      this youth were all the more inflammable, because they had hitherto been
      held in check.
    </p>
    <p>
      No less embarrassed than her cousin, Adrienne de Cardoville remained
      seated. Like Djalma, she cast down her eyes; but the burning blush on her
      cheeks, the quick heaving of her virgin bosom, revealed an emotion that
      she did not even attempt to hide. Notwithstanding the powers of her mind,
      by turns gay, graceful, and witty&mdash;notwithstanding the decision of
      her proud and independent character, and her complete acquaintance with
      the manners of the world&mdash;Adrienne shared Djalma&rsquo;s simple and
      enchanting awkwardness, and partook of that kind of temporary weakness,
      beneath which these two pure, ardent, and loving beings appeared sinking&mdash;as
      if unable to support the boiling agitation of the senses, combined with
      the intoxicating excitement of the heart. And yet their eyes had not met.
      Each seemed to fear the first electric shock of the other&rsquo;s glance&mdash;that
      invincible attraction of two impassioned beings&mdash;that sacred fire,
      which suddenly kindles the blood, and lifts two mortals from earth to
      heaven; for it is to approach the Divinity to give one&rsquo;s self up
      with religious fervor to the most noble and irresistible sentiment that He
      has implanted within us&mdash;the only sentiment that, in His adorable
      wisdom, the Dispenser of all good has vouchsafed to sanctify, by endowing
      it with a spark of His own creative energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma was the first to raise his eyes. They were moist and sparkling. The
      excitement of passionate love, the burning ardor of his age, so long
      repressed, the intense admiration in which he held ideal beauty, were all
      expressed in his look, mingled with respectful timidity, and gave to the
      countenance of this youth an undefinable, irresistible character. Yes,
      irresistible!&mdash;for, when Adrienne encountered his glance, she
      trembled in every limb, and felt herself attracted by a magnetic power.
      Already, her eyes were heavy with a kind of intoxicating languor, when, by
      a great effort of will and dignity, she succeeded in overcoming this
      delicious confusion, rose from her chair, and said to Djalma in a
      trembling voice: &ldquo;Prince, I am happy to receive you here.&rdquo;
      Then, pointing to one of the portraits suspended above her, she added, as
      if introducing him to a living person: &ldquo;Prince&mdash;my mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an instinct of rare delicacy, Adrienne had thus summoned her mother
      to be present at her interview with Djalma. It seemed a security for
      herself and the prince, against the seductions of a first interview&mdash;which
      was likely to be all the more perilous, that they both knew themselves
      madly loved that they both were free, and had only to answer to Providence
      for the treasures of happiness and enjoyment with which He had so
      magnificently endowed them. The prince understood Adrienne&rsquo;s
      thoughts; so that, when the young lady pointed to the portrait, Djalma, by
      a spontaneous movement full of grace and simplicity, knelt down before the
      picture, and said to it in a gentle, but manly voice: &ldquo;I will love
      and revere you as my mother. And, in thought, my mother too shall be
      present, and stand like you, beside your child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No better answer could have been given to the feeling which induced Mdlle.
      de Cardoville to place herself, as it were, under the protection of her
      mother. From that moment, confident in Djalma, confident in herself, the
      young lady felt more at her ease, and the delicious sense of happiness
      replaced those exciting emotions, which had at first so violently agitated
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seating herself once more, she said to Djalma, as she pointed to the
      opposite chair: &ldquo;Pray take a seat, my dear cousin; and allow me to
      call you so, for there is too much ceremony in the word prince; and do you
      call me cousin also, for I find other names too grave. Having settled this
      point, we can talk together like old friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes cousin,&rdquo; answered Djalma, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, as frankness is proper between friends,&rdquo; resumed
      Adrienne, &ldquo;I have first to make you a reproach,&rdquo; she added,
      with a half-smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had remained standing, with his arm resting on the chimney
      piece, in an attitude full of grace and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, cousin,&rdquo; continued Adrienne, &ldquo;a reproach, that you
      will perhaps forgive me for making. I had expected you a little sooner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, cousin, you may blame me for having come so soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the moment when I left home, a man, whom I did not know,
      approached my carriage, and said to me, with such an air of sincerity that
      I believed him: &lsquo;You are able to save the life of a person who has
      been a second father to you. Marshal Simon is in great danger, and, to
      rescue him, you must follow me on the instant&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a snare,&rdquo; cried Adrienne, hastily. &ldquo;Marshal
      Simon was here, scarcely an hour ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Djalma, joyfully, and as if he had been
      relieved from a great weight. &ldquo;Then there will be nothing to sadden
      this happy day!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, cousin,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, &ldquo;how came you not to
      suspect this emissary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some words, which afterwards escaped from him, inspired me with
      doubts,&rdquo; answered Djalma: &ldquo;but at first I followed him,
      fearing the marshal might be in danger&mdash;for I know that he also has
      enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I reflect on it, you were quite right, cousin, for some
      new plot against the marshal was probable enough; and the least doubt was
      enough to induce you to go to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so&mdash;even though you were waiting for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a generous sacrifice; and my esteem for you is increased by
      it, if it could be increased,&rdquo; said Adrienne, with emotion. &ldquo;But
      what became of this man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my desire, he got into the carriage with me. Anxious about the
      marshal, and in despair at seeing the time wasted, that I was to have
      passed with you, cousin, I pressed him with all sorts of questions.
      Several times, he replied to me with embarrassment, and then the idea
      struck me that the whole might be a snare. Remembering all that they had
      already attempted, to ruin me in your opinion, I immediately changed my
      course. The vexation of the man who accompanied me then because so
      visible, that I ought to have had no doubt upon the subject. Still, when I
      thought of Marshal Simon, I felt a kind of vague remorse, which you,
      cousin, have now happily set at rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those people are implacable!&rdquo; said Adrienne; &ldquo;but our
      happiness will be stronger than their hate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, she resumed, with her habitual frankness:
      &ldquo;My dear cousin, it is impossible for me to conceal what I have at
      heart. Let us talk for a few seconds of the past, which was made so
      painful to us, and then we will forget it forever, like an evil dream.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer you sincerely, at the risk of injuring myself,&rdquo;
      said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you make up your mind to exhibit yourself in public with&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that young girl?&rdquo; interrupted Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, cousin,&rdquo; replied Mdlle. de Cardoville, and she waited
      for Djalma&rsquo;s answer with anxious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger to the customs of this country,&rdquo; said Djalma,
      without any embarrassment, for he spoke the truth, &ldquo;with a mind
      weakened with despair, and misled by the fatal counsels of a man devoted
      to my enemies, I believed, even as I was told, that, by displaying before
      you the semblance of another love, I should excite your jealousy, and thus&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, cousin; I understand it all,&rdquo; said Adrienne hastily,
      interrupting Djalma in her turn, that she might spare him a painful
      confession. &ldquo;I too must have been blinded by despair, not to have
      seen through this wicked plot, especially after your rash and intrepid
      action. To risk death for the sake of my bouquet!&rdquo; added Adrienne,
      shuddering at the mere remembrance. &ldquo;But one last question,&rdquo;
      she resumed, &ldquo;though I am already sure of your answer. Did you
      receive a letter that I wrote to you, on the morning of the day in which I
      saw you at the theatre?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma made no reply. A dark cloud passed over his fine countenance, and,
      for a second, his features assumed so menacing an expression, that
      Adrienne was terrified at the effect produced by her words. But this
      violent agitation soon passed away, and Djalma&rsquo;s brow became once
      more calm and serene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been more merciful that I thought,&rdquo; said the prince to
      Adrienne, who looked at him with astonishment. &ldquo;I wished to come
      hither worthy of you, my cousin. I pardoned the man who, to serve my
      enemies, had given me all those fatal counsels. The same person, I am
      sure, must have intercepted your letter. Just now, at the memory of the
      evils he thus caused me, I, for a moment, regretted my clemency. But then,
      again, I thought of your letter of yesterday&mdash;and my anger is all
      gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the sad time of fear and suspicion is over&mdash;suspicion,
      that made me doubt of your sentiments, and you of mine. Oh, yes! far
      removed from us be that fatal past!&rdquo; cried Adrienne de Cardoville,
      with deep joy..
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30229m.jpg" alt="30229m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30229.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then, as if she had relieved her heart from the last thought of sadness,
      she continued: &ldquo;The future is all your own&mdash;the radiant future,
      without cloud or obstacle, pure in the immensity of its horizon, and
      extending beyond the reach of sight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the tone of enthusiastic hope which
      accompanied these words. But suddenly Adrienne&rsquo;s features assumed an
      expression of touching melancholy, and she added, in a voice of profound
      emotion: &ldquo;And yet&mdash;at this hour&mdash;so many unfortunate
      creatures suffer pain!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple touch of pity for the misfortunes of others, at the moment
      when the noble maiden herself attained to the highest point of happiness,
      had such an effect on Djalma, that involuntarily he fell on his knees
      before Adrienne, clasped his hands together, and turned towards her his
      fine countenance, with an almost daring expression. Then, hiding his face
      in his hands, he bowed his head without speaking a single word. There was
      a moment of deep silence. Adrienne was the first to break it, as she saw a
      tear steal through the slender fingers of the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend! what is the matter?&rdquo; she exclaimed, as with a
      movement rapid as thought, she stooped forward, and taking hold of Djalma&rsquo;s
      hands, drew them from before his face. That face was bathed in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weep!&rdquo; cried Mdlle. de Cardoville, so much agitated that
      she kept the hands of Djalma in her own; and, unable to dry his tears, the
      young Hindoo allowed them to flow like so many drops of crystal over the
      pale gold of his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not in this wide world a happiness like to mine!&rdquo;
      said the prince, in his soft, melodious voice, and with a kind of
      exhaustion: &ldquo;therefore do I feel great sadness, and so it should be.
      You give me heaven&mdash;and were I to give you the whole earth, it would
      be but a poor return. Alas! what can man do for a divinity, but humbly
      bless and adore? He can never hope to return the gifts bestowed: and this
      makes him suffer&mdash;not in his pride&mdash;but in his heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma did not exaggerate. He said what he really felt: and the rather
      hyperbolical form, familiar to Oriental nations, could alone express his
      thought. The tone of his regret was so sincere, his humility so gentle and
      full of simplicity, that Adrienne, also moved to tears, answered him with
      an effusion of serious tenderness, &ldquo;My friend, we are both at the
      supreme point of happiness. Our future felicity appears to have no limits,
      and yet, though derived from different sources, sad reflections have come
      to both of us. It is, you see, that there are some sorts of happiness,
      which make you dizzy with their own immensity. For a moment, the heart,
      the mind, the soul, are incapable of containing so much bliss; it
      overflows and drowns us. Thus the flowers sometimes hang their heads,
      oppressed by the too ardent rays of the sun, which is yet their love and
      life. Oh, my friend! this sadness may be great, but it also sweet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered these words, the voice of Adrienne grew fainter and
      fainter, and her head bowed lower, as if she were indeed sinking beneath
      the weight of her happiness. Djalma had remained kneeling before her, his
      hands in hers&mdash;so that as she thus bent forward, her ivory forehead
      and golden hair touched the amber-colored brow and ebon curls of Djalma.
      And the sweet, silent tears of the two young lovers flowed together, and
      mingled as they fell on their clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this scene was passing in Cardoville House, Agricola had gone to
      the Rue de Vaugirard, to deliver a letter from Adrienne to M. Hardy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. &ldquo;THE IMITATION.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s we have already
      said, M. Hardy occupied a pavilion in the &ldquo;Retreat&rdquo; annexed to
      the house in the Rue de Vaugirard, inhabited by a goodly number of the
      reverend fathers of the Company of Jesus. Nothing could be calmer and more
      silent than this dwelling. Every one spoke in whispers, and the servants
      themselves had something oily in their words, something sanctified in
      their very walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all that is subject to the chilling and destructive influences of
      these men, this mournfully quiet house was entirely wanting in life and
      animation. The boarders passed an existence of wearisome and icy monotony,
      only broken by the use of certain devotional exercises; and thus, in
      accordance with the selfish calculation of the reverend fathers, the mind,
      deprived of all nourishment and all external support, soon began to droop
      and pine away in solitude. The heart seemed to beat more slowly, the soul
      was benumbed, the character weakened; at last, all freewill, all power of
      discrimination, was extinguished, and the boarders, submitting to the same
      process of self-annihilation as the novices of the Company, became, like
      them, mere &ldquo;corpses&rdquo; in the hands of the brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of these manoeuvres was clear and simple. They secured the
      means of obtaining all kinds of donations, the constant aim of the
      skillful policy and merciless cupidity of these priests. By the aid of
      enormous sums, of which they thus become the possessors or the trustees,
      they follow out and obtain the success of their projects, even though
      murder, incendiarism, revolt, and all the horrors of civil war, excited by
      and through them, should drench in blood the lands over which they seek to
      extend their dark dominion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, was the asylum of peace and innocence in which Francois Hardy
      had taken refuge. He occupied the ground-floor of a summer-house, which
      opened upon a portion of the garden. His apartments had been judiciously
      chosen, for we know with what profound and diabolical craft the reverend
      fathers avail themselves of material influences, to make a deep impression
      upon the minds they are moulding to their purpose. Imagine a prospect
      bounded by a high wall, of a blackish gray, half-covered with ivy, the
      plant peculiar to ruins. A dark avenue of old yew-trees, so fit to shade
      the grave with their sepulchral verdure, extended from this wall to a
      little semicircle, in front of the apartment generally occupied by M.
      Hardy. Two or three mounds of earth, bordered with box, symmetrically cut,
      completed the charms of this garden, which in every respect resembled a
      cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Though the April sun
      shone brightly, its rays, intercepted by the high wall of which we have
      spoken, could not penetrate into that portion of the garden, obscure,
      damp, and cold as a cavern, which communicated with M. Hardy&rsquo;s
      apartment. The room was furnished with a perfect sense of the comfortable.
      A soft carpet covered the floor; thick curtains of dark green baize, the
      same color as the walls, sheltered an excellent bed, and hung in folds
      about the glass door, which opened on the garden. Some pieces of mahogany
      furniture, plain, but very clean and bright, stood round the room. Above
      the secretary, placed just in front of the bed, was a large ivory
      crucifix, upon a black velvet ground. The chimney-piece was adorned with a
      clock, in an ebony case, with ivory ornaments representing all sorts of
      gloomy emblems, such as hour-glasses, scythes, death&rsquo;s-heads, etc.
      Now imagine this scene in twilight, with its solitary and mournful
      silence, only broken at the hour of prayer by the lugubrious sound of the
      bells of the neighboring chapel, and you will recognize the infernal
      skill, with which these dangerous priests know how to turn to account
      every external object, when they wish to influence the mind of those they
      are anxious to gain over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was not all. After appealing to the senses, it was necessary to
      address themselves to the intellect&mdash;and this was the method adopted
      by the reverend fathers. A single book&mdash;but one&mdash;was left, as if
      by chance, within reach. This book was Thomas a Kempis&rsquo; &ldquo;Imitation.&rdquo;
      But as it might happen that M. Hardy would not have the courage or the
      desire to read this book, thoughts and reflections borrowed from its
      merciless pages, and written in very large characters, were suspended in
      black frames close to the bed, or at other parts within sight, so that,
      involuntarily, in the sad leisure of his inactive dejection, the dweller&rsquo;s
      eyes were almost necessarily attracted by them. To that fatal circle of
      despairing thoughts they confined the already weakened mind of this
      unfortunate man, so long a prey to the most acute sorrow. What he read
      mechanically, every instant of the day and night, whenever the blessed
      sleep fled from his eyes inflamed with tears, was not enough merely to
      plunge the soul of the victim into incurable despair, but also to reduce
      him to the corpse-like obedience required by the Society of Jesus. In that
      awful book may be found a thousand terrors to operate on weak minds, a
      thousand slavish maxims to chain and degrade the pusillanimous soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now imagine M. Hardy carried wounded into this house; while his heart,
      torn by bitter grief and the sense of horrible treachery, bled even faster
      than his external injuries. Attended with the utmost care, and thanks to
      the acknowledged skill of Dr. Baleinier, M. Hardy soon recovered from the
      hurts he had received when he threw himself into the embers of his burning
      factory. Yet, in order to favor the projects of the reverend fathers, a
      drug, harmless enough in its effects, but destined to act for a time upon
      the mind of the patient, and often employed for that purpose in similar
      important cases by the pious doctor, was administered to Hardy, and had
      kept him pretty long in a state of mental torpor. To a soul agonized by
      cruel deceptions, it appears an inestimable benefit to be plunged into
      that kind of torpor, which at least prevents one from dwelling upon the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardy resigned himself entirely to this profound apathy, and at length
      came to regard it as the supreme good. Thus do unfortunate wretches,
      tortured by cruel diseases, accept with gratitude the opiate which kills
      them slowly, but which at least deadens the sense of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sketching the portrait of M. Hardy, we tried to give some idea of the
      exquisite delicacy of his tender soul, of his painful susceptibility with
      regard to anything base or wicked, and of his extreme goodness,
      uprightness, and generosity. We now allude to these admirable qualities,
      because we must observe, that with him, as with almost all who possess
      them, they were not, and could not be, united with an energetic and
      resolute character. Admirably persevering in good deeds, the influence of
      this excellent man, was insinuating rather than commanding; it was not by
      the bold energy and somewhat overbearing will, peculiar to other men of
      great and noble heart, that Hardy had realized the prodigy of his Common
      Dwelling-house; it was by affectionate persuasion, for with him mildness
      took the place of force. At sight of any baseness or injustice, he did not
      rouse himself, furious and threatening; but he suffered intense pain. He
      did not boldly attack the criminal, but he turned away from him in pity
      and sorrow. And then his loving heart, so full of feminine delicacy, had
      an irresistible longing for the blessed contact of dear affections; they
      alone could keep it alive. Even as a poor, frail bird dies with the cold,
      when it can no longer lie close to its brethren, and receive and
      communicate the sweet warmth of the maternal nest. And now this sensitive
      organization, this extremely susceptible nature, receives blow after blow
      from sorrows and deceptions, one of which would suffice to shake, if it
      did not conquer, the firmest and most resolute character. Hardy&rsquo;s
      best friend has infamously betrayed him. His adored mistress has abandoned
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house which he had founded for the benefit of his workmen, whom he
      loved as brethren, is reduced to a heap of ashes. What then happens? All
      the springs of his soul are at once broken. Too feeble to resist such
      frightful attacks, too fatally deceived to seek refuge in other
      affections, too much discouraged to think of laying the first stone of any
      new edifice&mdash;this poor heart, isolated from every salutary influence,
      finds oblivion of the world and of itself in a kind of gloomy torpor. And
      if some remaining instincts of life and affection, at long intervals,
      endeavored to rouse themselves within him, and if, half-opening his mind&rsquo;s
      eye, which he had kept closed against the present, the past, and the
      future, Hardy looks around him&mdash;what does he see? Only these
      sentences, so full of terrible despair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art nothing but dust and ashes. Grief and tears art thy
      portion. Believe not in any son of man. There are no such things as
      friendship or ties of kindred. All human affections are false. Die in the
      morning, and thou wilt be forgotten before night. Be humble&mdash;despise
      thyself&mdash;and let others despise thee. Think not, reason not, live not&mdash;but
      commit thy fate to the hands of a superior, who will think and reason for
      thee. Weep, suffer, think upon death. Yes, death! always death&mdash;that
      should be thy thought when thou thinkest&mdash;but it is better not to
      think at all. Let a feeling of ceaseless woe prepare thy way to heaven. It
      is only by sorrow that we are welcome to the terrible God whom we adore!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the consolations offered to this unfortunate man. Affrighted, he
      again closed his eyes, and fell back into his lethargy. As for leaving
      this gloomy retreat, he could not, or rather he did not desire to do so.
      He had lost the power of will; and then, it must be confessed, he had
      finished by getting accustomed to this house, and liked it well&mdash;they
      paid him such discreet attentions, and yet left him so much alone with his
      grief&mdash;there reigned all around such a death-like silence, which
      harmonized closely with the silence of his heart; and that was now the
      tomb of his last love, last friendship, last hope. All energy was dead
      within him! Then began that slow, but inevitable transformation, so
      judiciously foreseen by Rodin, who directed the whole of this machination,
      even in its smallest details. At first alarmed by the dreadful maxims
      which surrounded him, M. Hardy had at length accustomed himself to read
      them over almost mechanically, just as the captive, in his mournful hours
      of leisure, counts the nails in the door of his prison, or the bars of the
      grated window. This was already a great point gained by the reverend
      fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon his weakened mind was struck with the apparent correctness of
      these false and melancholy aphorisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he read: &ldquo;Do not count upon the affection of any human creature&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he had himself been shamefully betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man is born to sorrow and despair&rdquo;&mdash;and he was himself
      despairing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no rest save in the cessation of thought&rdquo;&mdash;and
      the slumber of his mind had brought some relief to his pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peepholes, skillfully concealed by the hangings and in the wainscoting of
      these apartments, enabled the reverend fathers at all times to see and
      hear the boarders, and above all to observe their countenance and manner,
      when they believed themselves to be alone. Every exclamation of grief
      which escaped Hardy in his gloomy solitude, was repeated to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      by a mysterious listener. The reverend father, following scrupulously
      Rodin&rsquo;s instructions, had at first visited his boarder very rarely.
      We have said, that when Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny wished it, he could
      display an almost irresistible power of charming, and accordingly he threw
      all his tact and skill into the interviews he had with Hardy, when he came
      from time to time to inquire after his health. Informed of everything by
      his spies, and aided by his natural sagacity, he soon saw all the use that
      might be made of the physical and moral prostration of the boarder.
      Certain beforehand that Hardy would not take the hint, he spoke to him
      frequently of the gloom of the house, advising him affectionately to leave
      it, if he felt oppressed by its monotony, or at all events to seek beyond
      its walls for some pleasure and amusement. To speak of pleasure and
      amusement to this unfortunate man, was in his present state to insure a
      refusal, and so it of course happened. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny did not at
      first try to gain the recluse&rsquo;s confidence, nor did he speak to him
      of sorrow; but every time he came, he appeared to take such a tender
      interest in him, and showed it by a few simple and well timed words. By
      degrees, these interviews, at first so rare, became more frequent and
      longer. Endowed with a flow of honeyed, insinuating, and persuasive
      eloquence, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny naturally took for his theme those
      gloomy maxims, to which Hardy&rsquo;s attention was now so often directed.

    <p>
      Supple, prudent, skillful, knowing that the hermit had hitherto professed
      that generous natural religion which teaches the grateful adoration of
      God, the love of humanity, the worship of what is just and good, and
      which, disdaining dogmas, professes the same veneration for Marcus
      Aurelius as for Confucius, for Plato as for Christ, for Moses as for
      Lycurgus&mdash;Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny did not at first attempt to convert
      him, but began by incessantly reminding him of the abominable deceptions
      practised upon him; and, instead of describing such treachery as an
      exception in life&mdash;instead of trying to calm, encourage, and revive
      his drooping soul&mdash;instead of exhorting Hardy to seek oblivion and
      consolation in the discharge of his duties toward humanity, towards his
      brethren, whom he had previously loved and succored&mdash;Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      strove to inflame the bleeding wounds of the unfortunate man, painted the
      human race in the most atrocious blackness, and, by declaring all men
      treacherous, ungrateful, wicked, succeeded in rendering his despair
      incurable. Having attained this object, the Jesuit took another step.
      Knowing Hardy&rsquo;s admirable goodness of heart, and profiting by the
      weakened state of his mind, he spoke to him of the consolation to be
      derived by a man overwhelmed with sorrow, from the belief that every one
      of his tears, instead of being unfruitful, was in fact agreeable to God,
      and might aid in the salvation of souls&mdash;the belief, as the reverend
      father adroitly added, that by faith alone can sorrow be made useful to
      humanity, and acceptable to Divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever impiety, whatever atrocious Machiavelism there was in these
      detestable maxims, which make of a loving-kind Deity a being delighted
      with the tears of his creatures, was thus skillfully concealed from Hardy&rsquo;s
      eyes, whose generous instincts were still alive. Soon did this loving and
      tender soul, whom unworthy priests were driving to a sort of moral
      suicide, find a mournful charm in the fiction, that his sorrows would at
      least be profitable to other men. It was at first only a fiction; but the
      enfeebled mind which takes pleasure in such a fable, finishes by receiving
      it as a reality, and by degrees will submit to the consequences. Such was
      Hardy&rsquo;s moral and physical state, when, by means of a servant who
      had been bought over, he received from Agricola Baudoin a letter
      requesting an interview. Alone, the workman could not have broken the band
      of the Jesuit&rsquo;s pleadings, but he was accompanied by Gabriel, whose
      eloquence and reasonings were of a most convincing nature to a spirit like
      Hardy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to point out to the reader, with what dignified reserve
      Gabriel had confined himself to the most generous means of rescuing Hardy
      from the deadly influence of the reverend fathers. It was repugnant to the
      great soul of the young missionary, to stoop to a revelation of the odious
      plots of these priests. He would only have taken this extreme course, had
      his powerful and sympathetic words have failed to have any effect on Hardy&rsquo;s
      blindness. About a quarter of an hour had elapsed since Gabriel&rsquo;s
      departure, when the servant appointed to wait on this boarder of the
      reverend fathers entered and delivered to him a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom is this?&rdquo; asked Hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a boarder in the house, sir,&rdquo; answered the servant
      bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man had a crafty hypocritical face; he wore his hair combed over his
      forehead, spoke in a low voice, and always cast clown his eyes. Waiting
      the answer, he joined his hands, and began to twiddle his thumbs. Hardy
      opened the letter, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR,&mdash;I have only just heard, by mere chance, that you also
      inhabit this respectable house: a long illness, and the retirement in
      which I live, will explain my ignorance of your being so near. Though we
      have only met once, sir, the circumstance which led to that meeting was of
      so serious a nature, that I cannot think you have forgotten it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardy stopped, and tasked his memory for an explanation, and not finding
      anything to put him on the right track, he continued to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This circumstance excited in me a feeling of such deep and
      respectful sympathy for you, sir, that I cannot resist my anxious desire
      to wait upon you, particularly as I learn, that you intend leaving this
      house to day&mdash;a piece of information I have just derived from the
      excellent and worthy Abbe Gabriel, one of the men I most love, esteem, and
      reverence. May I venture to hope, sir, that just at the moment of quitting
      our common retreat to return to the world, you will deign to receive
      favorably the request, however intrusive, of a poor old man, whose life
      will henceforth be passed in solitude, and who cannot therefore have any
      prospect of meeting you, in that vortex of society which he has abandoned
      forever. Waiting the honor of your answer, I beg you to accept, sir, the
      assurance of the sentiments of high esteem with which I remain, sir, with
      the deepest respect,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very humble and most obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RODIN.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading this letter and the signature of the writer, Hardy remained
      for some time in deep thought, without being able to recollect the name of
      Rodin, or to what serious circumstances he alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence of some duration, he said to the servant &ldquo;M. Rodin
      gave you this letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is M. Rodin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good old gentleman, who is just recovering from a long illness,
      that almost carried him off. Lately, he has been getting better, but he is
      still so weak and melancholy, that it makes one sad to see him. It is a
      great pity, for there is not a better and more worthy gentleman in the
      house&mdash;unless it be you, sir,&rdquo; added the servant, bowing with
      an air of flattering respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Rodin;&rdquo; said Hardy, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It is singular,
      that I should not remember the name nor any circumstance connected with
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will give me your answer, sir,&rdquo; resumed the servant,
      &ldquo;I will take it to M. Rodin. He is now with Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      to whom he is bidding farewell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, the post-horses have just come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Post-horses for whom?&rdquo; asked Hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going on a journey then!&rdquo; said Hardy, with some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he will not, I think be long absent,&rdquo; said the servant,
      with a confidential air, &ldquo;for the reverend father takes no one with
      him, and but very light luggage. No doubt, the reverend father will come
      to say farewell to you, sir, before he starts. But what answer shall I
      give M. Rodin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, just received, was couched in such polite terms&mdash;it spoke
      of Gabriel with so much respect&mdash;that Hardy, urged moreover by a
      natural curiosity, and seeing no motive to refuse this interview before
      quitting the house, said to the servant: &ldquo;Please tell M. Rodin, that
      if he will give himself the trouble to come to me, I shall be glad to see
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will let him know immediately, sir,&rdquo; answered the servant,
      bowing as he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When alone, Hardy, while wondering who this M. Rodin could be, began to
      make some slight preparations for his departure. For nothing in the world
      would he have passed another night in this house; and, in order to keep up
      his courage, he recalled every instant the mild, evangelical language of
      Gabriel, just as the superstitious recite certain litanies, with a view of
      escaping from temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant soon returned, and said: &ldquo;M. Rodin is here, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg him to walk in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin entered, clad in his long black dressing-gown, and with his old silk
      cap in his hand. The servant then withdrew. The day was just closing.
      Hardy rose to meet Rodin, whose features he did not at first distinguish.
      But as the reverend father approached the window, Hardy looked narrowly at
      him for an instant, and then uttered an exclamation, wrung from him by
      surprise and painful remembrance. But, recovering himself from this first
      movement, Hardy said to the Jesuit, in an agitated voice: &ldquo;You here,
      sir? Oh, you are right! It was indeed a very serious circumstance that
      first brought us together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear sir!&rdquo; said Rodin, in a kindly and unctuous tone;
      &ldquo;I was sure you would not have forgotten me.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XLIII. PRAYER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t will doubtless
      be remembered that Rodin had gone (although a stranger to Hardy) to visit
      him at his factory, and inform him of De Blessac&rsquo;s shameful
      treachery&mdash;a dreadful blow, which had only preceded by a few moments
      a second no less horrible misfortune; for it was in the presence of Rodin
      that Hardy had learned the unexpected departure of the woman he adored.
      Painful to him must have been the sudden appearance of Rodin. Yes, thanks
      to the salutary influence of Gabriel&rsquo;s counsels, he recovered
      himself by degrees, and the contraction of his features being succeeded by
      a melancholy calm, he said to Rodin: &ldquo;I did not indeed expect to
      meet you, sir, in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir!&rdquo; answered Rodin, with a sigh, &ldquo;I did not
      expect to come hither, probably to end my days beneath this roof, when I
      went, without being acquainted with you, but only as one honest man should
      serve another, to unveil to you a great infamy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir, you then rendered me a true service; perhaps, in that
      painful moment, I did not fully express my gratitude; for, at the same
      moment in which you revealed to me the treachery of M. de Blessac&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were overwhelmed by another piece of painful intelligence,&rdquo;
      said Rodin, interrupting M. Hardy; &ldquo;I shall never forget the sudden
      arrival of that poor woman, who, pale and affrighted, and without
      considering my presence, came to inform you that a person who was
      exceedingly dear to you had quitted Paris abruptly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and, without stopping to thank you, I set out
      immediately,&rdquo; answered Hardy, with a mournful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, &ldquo;that there are sometimes very strange coincidences?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what do you allude, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I went to inform you that you were betrayed in so infamous a
      manner&mdash;I was myself&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin paused, as if unable to control his deep emotion, and his
      countenance wore the expression of such overpowering grief that Hardy said
      to him, with interest: &ldquo;What ails you, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; replied Rodin, with a bitter smile. &ldquo;Thanks
      to the ghostly counsels of the angelic Abbe Gabriel, I have reached a sort
      of resignation. Still, there are certain memories which affect me with the
      most acute pain. I told you,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, in a firmer voice,
      &ldquo;or was going to tell you, that the very day after that on which I
      informed you of the treachery practised against you, I was myself the
      victim of a frightful deception. An adopted son&mdash;a poor unfortunate
      child, whom I had brought up&mdash;&rdquo; He paused again, drew his
      trembling hand over his eyes, and added: &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, for
      speaking of matters which must be indifferent to you. Excuse the intrusive
      sorrow of a poor, broken hearted old man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have suffered too much myself, sir, to be indifferent to any kind
      of sorrow,&rdquo; replied Hardy. &ldquo;Besides, you are no stranger to me&mdash;for
      you did me a real service&mdash;and we both agree in our veneration for
      the same young priest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbe Gabriel!&rdquo; cried Rodin, interrupting Hardy; &ldquo;ah,
      sir! he is my deliverer, my benefactor. If you knew all his care and
      devotion, during my long illness, caused by intense grief&mdash;if you
      knew the ineffable sweetness of his counsels&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them, sir,&rdquo; cried Hardy; &ldquo;oh, yes! I know how
      salutary is the influence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his mouth, sir, the precepts of religion are full of mildness,&rdquo;
      resumed Rodin, with excitement. &ldquo;Do they not heal and console? do
      they not make us love and hope, instead of fear and tremble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, sir! in this very house,&rdquo; said Hardy, &ldquo;I have
      been able to make the comparison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was happy enough,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;to have the angelic
      Abbe Gabriel for my confessor, or, rather, my confidant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hardy, &ldquo;for he prefers confidence to
      confession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well you know him!&rdquo; said Rodin, in a tone of the utmost
      simplicity. Then he resumed: &ldquo;He is not a man but an angel. His
      words would convert the most hardened sinner. Without being exactly
      impious, I had myself lived in the profession of what is called Natural
      Religion; but the angelic Abbe Gabriel has, by degrees, fixed my wavering
      belief, given it body and soul, and, in fact, endowed me with faith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! he is a truly Christian priest&mdash;a priest of love and
      pardon!&rdquo; cried Hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is perfectly true,&rdquo; replied Rodin; &ldquo;for I
      came here almost mad with grief, thinking only of the unhappy boy who had
      repaid my paternal goodness with the most monstrous ingratitude, and
      sometimes I yielded to violent bursts of despair, and sometimes sank into
      a state of mournful dejection, cold as the grave itself. But, suddenly,
      the Abbe Gabriel appeared&mdash;and the darkness fled before the dawning
      of a new day.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, sir; there are strange coincidences,&rdquo; said
      Hardy, yielding more and more to the feeling of confidence and sympathy,
      produced by the resemblance of his real position to Rodin&rsquo;s
      pretended one. &ldquo;And to speak frankly,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am
      very glad I have seen you before quitting this house. Were I capable of
      falling back into fits of cowardly weakness, your example alone would
      prevent me. Since I listen to you, I feel myself stronger in the noble
      path which the angelic Abbe Gabriel has opened before me, as you so well
      express it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor old man will not then regret having listened to the first
      impulse of his heart, which urged him to come to you,&rdquo; said Robin,
      with a touching expression. &ldquo;You will sometimes remember me in that
      world to which you are returning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure of it, sir; but allow me to ask one question: You remain,
      you say, in this house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do? There reigns here a calm repose, and one
      is not disturbed in one&rsquo;s prayers,&rdquo; said Rodin, in a very
      gentle tone. &ldquo;You see, I have suffered so much&mdash;the conduct of
      that unhappy youth was so horrible&mdash;he plunged into such shocking
      excesses&mdash;that the wrath of heaven must be kindled against him. Now I
      am very old, and it is only by passing the few days that are left me in
      fervent prayer that I can hope to disarm the just anger of the Lord. Oh!
      prayer&mdash;prayer! It was the Abbe Gabriel who revealed to me all its
      power and sweetness&mdash;and therewith the formidable duties it imposes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its duties are indeed great and sacred,&rdquo; answered Hardy, with
      a pensive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the life of Rancey?&rdquo; said Rodin, abruptly, as
      he darted a peculiar glance at Hardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The founder of La Trappe?&rdquo; said Hardy, surprised at Rodin&rsquo;s
      question. &ldquo;I remember hearing a very vague account, some time ago,
      of the motives of his conversion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, mark you, no more striking an example of the power of
      prayer, and of the state of almost divine ecstasy, to which it may lead a
      religious soul. In a few words, I will relate to you this instructive and
      tragic history. Rancey&mdash;but I beg your pardon; I fear I am
      trespassing on your time.&rdquo;
    </p>

      <a href="images/30261.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Hardy, hastily; &ldquo;You cannot think how
      interested I am in what you tell me. My interview with the Abbe Gabriel
      was abruptly broken off, and in listening to you I fancy that I hear the
      further development of his views. Go on, I conjure you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart. I only wish that the instruction which, thanks
      to our angelic priest, I derived from the story of Rancey might be as
      profitable to you as it was to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, also came from the Abbe Gabriel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He related to me this kind of parable in support of his
      exhortations,&rdquo; replied Rodin. &ldquo;Oh, sir! do I not owe to the
      consoling words of that young priest all that has strengthened and revived
      my poor old broken heart?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall listen to you with a double interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rancey was a man of the world,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, as he looked
      attentively at Hardy; &ldquo;a gentleman&mdash;young, ardent, handsome. He
      loved a young lady of high rank. I cannot tell what impediments stood in
      the way of their union. But this love, though successful, was kept secret,
      and every evening Rancey visited his mistress by means of a private
      staircase. It was, they say, one of those passionate loves which men feel
      but once in their lives. The mystery, even the sacrifice made by the
      unfortunate girl, who forgot every duty, seemed to give new charms to this
      guilty passion. In the silence and darkness of secrecy, these two lovers
      passed two years of voluptuous delirium, which amounted almost to ecstasy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Hardy started. For the first time of late his brow was
      suffused with a deep blush; his heart throbbed violently; he remembered
      that he too had once known the ardent intoxication of a guilty and hidden
      love. Though the day was closing rapidly, Rodin cast a sidelong glance at
      Hardy, and perceived the impression he had made. &ldquo;Some times,&rdquo;
      he continued, &ldquo;thinking of the dangers to which his mistress was
      exposed, if their connection should be discovered, Rancey wished to sever
      these delicious ties; but the girl, beside herself with passion, threw
      herself on the neck of her lover, and threatened him, in the language of
      intense excitement, to reveal and to brave all, if he thought of leaving
      her. Too weak and loving to resist the prayers of his mistress, Rancey
      again and again yielded, and they both gave themselves up to a torrent of
      delight, which carried them along, forgetful of earth and heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Hardy listened to Rodin with feverish and devouring avidity. The
      Jesuit, in painting, with these almost sensual colors, an ardent and
      secret love, revived in Hardy burning memories, which till now had been
      drowned in tears. To the beneficent calm produced by the mild language of
      Gabriel had succeeded a painful agitation, which, mingled with the
      reaction of the shocks received that day, began to throw his mind into a
      strange state of confusion.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30285m.jpg" alt="30285m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30285.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Rodin, having so far succeeded in his object, continued as follows:
      &ldquo;A fatal day came at last. Rancey, obliged to go to the wars,
      quitted the girl; but, after a short campaign, he returned, more in love
      than ever. He had written privately, to say he would arrive almost
      immediately after his letter. He came accordingly. It was night. He
      ascended, as usual, the private staircase which led to the chamber of his
      mistress; he entered the room, his heart beating with love and hope. His
      mistress had died that morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Hardy, covering his face with his hands, in
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was dead,&rdquo; resumed Rodin. &ldquo;Two wax-candles were
      burning beside the funeral couch. Rancey could not, would not believe that
      she was dead. He threw himself on his knees by the corpse. In his
      delirium, he seized that fair, beloved head, to cover it with kisses. The
      head parted from the body, and remained in his hands! Yes,&rdquo; resumed
      Rodin as Hardy drew back, pale and mute with terror, &ldquo;yes, the girl
      had fallen a victim to so swift and extraordinary a disease, that she had
      not been able to receive the last sacraments. After her death, the
      doctors, in the hope of discovering the cause of this unknown malady, had
      begun to dissect that fair form&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Rodin reached this part of his narrative, night was almost come. A sort
      of hazy twilight alone reigned in this silent chamber, in the centre of
      which appeared the pale and ghastly form of Rodin, clad in his long black
      gown, whilst his eyes seemed to sparkle with diabolic fire. Overcome by
      the violent emotions occasioned by this story, in which thoughts of death
      and voluptuousness, love and horror, were so strangely mingled, Hardy
      remained fixed and motionless, waiting for the words of Rodin, with a
      combination of curiosity, anguish and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rancey?&rdquo; said he, at last, in an agitated voice, whilst
      he wiped the cold sweat from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After two days of furious delirium,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;he
      renounced the world, and shut himself up in impenetrable solitude. The
      first period of his retreat was frightful; in his despair, he uttered loud
      yells of grief and rage, that were audible at some distance. Twice he
      attempted suicide, to escape from the terrible visions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had visions, then?&rdquo; said Hardy, with an increased agony of
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Rodin, in a solemn tone, &ldquo;he had fearful
      visions. He saw the girl, who, for his sake, had died in mortal sin,
      plunged in the heat of the everlasting flames of hell! On that fair face,
      disfigured by infernal tortures, was stamped the despairing laugh of the
      damned! Her teeth gnashed with pain; her arms writhed in anguish! She wept
      tears of blood, and, with an agonized and avenging voice, she cried to her
      seducer: &lsquo;Thou art the cause of my perdition&mdash;my curse, my
      curse be upon thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced these last words, Rodin advanced three steps nearer to
      Hardy, accompanying each step with a menacing gesture. If we remember the
      state of weakness, trouble, and fear, in which M. Hardy was&mdash;if we
      remember that the Jesuit had just roused in the soul of this unfortunate
      man all the sensual and spiritual memories of a love, cooled, but not
      extinguished, in tears&mdash;if we remember, too, that Hardy reproached
      himself with the seduction of a beloved object, whom her departure from
      her duties might (according to the Catholic faith) doom to everlasting
      flames&mdash;we shall not wonder at the terrible effect of this
      phantasmagoria, conjured up in silence and solitude, in the evening dusk,
      by this fearful priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect on Hardy was indeed striking, and the more dangerous, that the
      Jesuit, with diabolical craft, seemed only to be carrying out, from
      another point of view, the ideas of Gabriel. Had not the young priest
      convinced Hardy that nothing is sweeter, than to ask of heaven forgiveness
      for those who have sinned, or whom we have led astray? But forgiveness
      implies punishment; and it was to the punishment alone that Rodin drew the
      attention of his victim, by painting it in these terrible hues. With hands
      clasped together, and eye fixed and dilated, Hardy trembled in all his
      limbs, and seemed still listening to Rodin, though the latter had ceased
      to speak. Mechanically, he repeated: &ldquo;My curse, my curse be upon
      thee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he exclaimed, in a kind of frenzy: &ldquo;The curse is on me
      also! The woman, whom I taught to forget her sacred duties, and to commit
      mortal sin&mdash;one day plunged in the everlasting flames&mdash;her arms
      writhing in agony&mdash;weeping tears of blood&mdash;will cry to me from
      the bottomless pit: &lsquo;My curse, my curse be upon thee!&rsquo;&mdash;One
      day,&rdquo; he added, with redoubled terror, &ldquo;one day?&mdash;who
      knows? perhaps at this moment!&mdash;for if the sea voyage had been fatal
      to her&mdash;if a shipwreck&mdash;oh, God! she too would have died in
      mortal sin&mdash;lost, lost, forever!&mdash;Oh, have mercy on her, my God!
      Crush me in Thy wrath&mdash;but have mercy on her&mdash;for I alone am
      guilty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the unfortunate man, almost delirious, sank with clasped hands upon
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Rodin, in an affectionate voice, as he hastened
      to lift him up, &ldquo;my dear sir&mdash;my dear friend&mdash;be calm!
      Comfort yourself. I cannot bear to see you despond. Alas! my intention was
      quite the contrary to that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curse! the curse! yes, she will curse me also&mdash;she, that I
      loved so much&mdash;in the everlasting flames!&rdquo; murmured Hardy,
      shuddering, and apparently insensible to the other&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir, listen to me, I entreat you,&rdquo; resumed the
      latter; &ldquo;let me finish my story, and then you will find it as
      consoling as it now seems terrible. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, remember the
      adorable words of our angelic Abbe Gabriel, with regard to the sweetness
      of prayer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Gabriel, Hardy recovered himself a little, and exclaimed,
      in a heart-rending tone: &ldquo;Ay! his words were sweet and beneficent.
      Where are they now? For mercy&rsquo;s sake, repeat to me those consoling
      words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our angelic Abbe Gabriel,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;spoke to you
      of the sweetness of prayer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! prayer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear sir, listen to me, and you shall see how prayer saved
      Rancey, and made a saint of him. Yes, these frightful torments, that I
      have just described, these threatening visions, were all conquered by
      prayer, and changed into celestial delights.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you,&rdquo; said Hardy, in a faint voice, &ldquo;speak to
      me of Gabriel, speak to me of heaven&mdash;but no more flames&mdash;no
      more hell&mdash;where sinful women weep tears of blood&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Rodin; and even as, in describing hell, his
      tone had been harsh and threatening, it now became warm and tender, as he
      uttered the following words: &ldquo;No; we will have no more images of
      despair&mdash;for, as I have told you, after suffering infernal tortures,
      Rancey, thanks to the power of prayer, enjoyed the delights of paradise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The delights of paradise?&rdquo; repeated Hardy, listening with
      anxious attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, at the height of his grief, a priest, a good priest&mdash;another
      Abbe Gabriel&mdash;came to Rancey. Oh, happiness! oh, providential change!
      In a few days, he taught the sufferer the sacred mysteries of prayer&mdash;that
      pious intercession of the creature, addressed to the Creator, in favor of
      a soul exposed to the wrath of heaven. Then Rancey seemed transformed. His
      grief was at once appeased. He prayed; and the more he prayed, the greater
      was his hope. He felt that God listened to his prayer. Instead of trying
      to forget his beloved, he now thought of her constantly, and prayed for
      her salvation. Happy in his obscure cell, alone with that adored
      remembrance, he passed days and nights in praying for her&mdash;plunged in
      an ineffable, burning, I had almost said amorous ecstasy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to give an idea of the tone of almost sensual energy with
      which Rodin pronounced the word &ldquo;amorous.&rdquo; Hardy started,
      changing from hot to cold. For the first time, his weakened mind caught a
      glimpse of the fatal pleasures of asceticism, and of that deplorable
      catalepsy, described in the lives of St. Theresa, St. Aubierge and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin perceived the other&rsquo;s thoughts, and continued &ldquo;Oh,
      Rancey was not now the man to content himself with a vague, passing
      prayer, uttered in the whirl of the world&rsquo;s business, which swallows
      it up, and prevents it from reaching the ear of heaven. No, no; in the
      depth of solitude, he endeavored to make his prayers even more
      efficacious, so ardently did he desire the eternal salvation of his
      mistress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do then&mdash;oh! what did he do in his solitude?&rdquo;
      cried Hardy, who was now powerless in the hands of the Jesuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; said Rodin, with a slight emphasis, &ldquo;he
      became a monk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A monk!&rdquo; repeated Hardy, with a pensive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;he became a monk, because his
      prayers were thus more likely to be favorably accepted. And then, as in
      solitude our thoughts are apt to wander, he fasted, and mortified his
      flesh, and brought into subjection all that was carnal within him, so
      that, becoming all spirit, his prayers might issue like a pure flame from
      his bosom, and ascend like the perfume of incense to the throne of the
      Most High!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a delicious dream!&rdquo; cried Hardy, more and more under
      the influence of the spell; &ldquo;to pray for the woman we have adored,
      and to become spirit&mdash;perfume&mdash;light!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; spirit, perfume, light!&rdquo; said Rodin, with emphasis.
      &ldquo;But it is no dream. How many monks, how many hermits, like Rancey,
      have, by prayers, and austerity, and macerations, attained a divine
      ecstasy! and if you only knew the celestial pleasures of such ecstasies!&mdash;Thus,
      after he became a monk, the terrible dreams were succeeded by enchanting
      visions. Many times, after a day of fasting, and a night passed in prayers
      and macerations, Rancey sank down exhausted on the floor of his cell! Then
      the spirit freed itself from the vile clogs of matter. His senses were
      absorbed in pleasure; the sound of heavenly harmony struck upon his
      ravished car; a bright, mild light, which was not of this world, dawned
      upon his half-closed eyes; and, at the height of the melodious vibrations
      of the golden harps of the Seraphim, in the centre of a glory, compared to
      which the sun is pale, the monk beheld the image of that beloved woman&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom by his prayers he had at length rescued from the eternal
      flames?&rdquo; said Hardy, in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, herself,&rdquo; replied Rodin, with eloquent enthusiasm, for
      this monster was skilled in every style of speech. &ldquo;Thanks to the
      prayers of her lover, which the Lord had granted, this woman no longer
      shed tears of blood&mdash;no longer writhed her beautiful arms in the
      convulsions of infernal anguish. No, no; still fair&mdash;oh! a thousand
      times fairer than when she dwelt on earth&mdash;fair with the everlasting
      beauty of angels&mdash;she smiled on her lover with ineffable ardor, and,
      her eyes beaming with a mild radiance, she said to him in a tender and
      passionate voice: &lsquo;Glory to the Lord! glory to thee, O my beloved!
      Thy prayers and austerities have saved me. I am numbered amongst the
      chosen. Thanks, my beloved, and glory!&rsquo;&mdash;And therewith, radiant
      in her felicity, she stooped to kiss, with lips fragrant with immortality,
      the lips of the enraptured monk&mdash;and their souls mingled in that
      kiss, burning as love, chaste as divine grace immense as eternity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Hardy, completely beside himself; &ldquo;a whole
      life of prayer, fasting, torture, for such a moment&mdash;with her, whom I
      mourn&mdash;with her, whom I have perhaps led to perdition!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say? such a moment!&rdquo; cried Rodin, whose yellow
      forehead was bathed in sweat like that of a magnetizer, and who now took
      Hardy by the hand, and drew still closer, as if to breathe into him the
      burning delirium; &ldquo;it was not once in his religious life&mdash;it
      was almost every day, that Rancey, plunged in divine ecstasy, enjoyed
      these delicious, ineffable, superhuman pleasures, which are to the
      pleasures of earth what eternity is to man&rsquo;s existence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing, no doubt, that Hardy was now at the point to which he wished to
      bring him, and the night being almost entirely come, the reverend father
      coughed two or three times in a significant manner, and looked towards the
      door. At this moment, Hardy, in the height of his frenzy, exclaimed, with
      a supplicating voice: &ldquo;A cell&mdash;a tomb&mdash;and the Ecstatic
      Vision!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room opened, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny entered, with a
      cloak under his arm. A servant followed him, bearing a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten minutes after this scene, a dozen robust men with frank, open
      countenances, led by Agricola, entered the Rue de Vaugirard, and advanced
      joyously towards the house of the reverend fathers. It was a deputation
      from the former workmen of M. Hardy. They came to escort him, and to
      congratulate him on his return amongst them. Agricola walked at their
      head. Suddenly he saw a carriage with post-horses issuing from the gateway
      of the house. The postilion whipped up the horses, and they started at
      full gallop. Was it chance or instinct? The nearer the carriage approached
      the group of which he formed a part, the more did Agricola&rsquo;s heart
      sink within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression became so vivid that it was soon changed into a terrible
      apprehension; and at the moment when the vehicle, which had its blinds
      down, was about to pass close by him, the smith, in obedience to a
      resistless impulse, exclaimed, as he rushed to the horses&rsquo; heads:
      &ldquo;Help, friends! stop them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postilion! ten louis if you ride over him!&rdquo; cried from the
      carriage the military voice of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cholera was still raging. The postilion had heard of the murder of the
      poisoners. Already frightened at the sudden attack of Agricola, he struck
      him a heavy blow on the head with the butt of his whip which stretched him
      senseless on the ground. Then, spurring with all his might, he urged his
      three horses into a triple gallop, and the carriage rapidly disappeared,
      whilst Agricola&rsquo;s companions, who had neither understood his actions
      nor the sense of his words, crowded around the smith, and did their best
      to revive him.

      CHAPTER XLIV. REMEMBRANCES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ther events took
      place a few days after the fatal evening in which M. Hardy, fascinated and
      misled by the deplorable, mystic jargon of Rodin, had implored Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      on his knees to remove him far from Paris, into some deep solitude where
      he might devote himself to a life of prayer and ascetic austerities.
      Marshal Simon, since his arrival in Paris, had occupied, with his two
      daughters, a house in the Rue des Trois-Freres. Before introducing the
      reader into this modest dwelling, we are obliged to recall to his memory
      some preceding facts. The day of the burning of Hardy &lsquo;s factory,
      Marshal Simon had come to consult with his father on a question of the
      highest importance, and to communicate to him his painful apprehensions on
      the subject of the growing sadness of his twin daughters, which he was
      unable to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshal Simon held in religious reverence the memory of the Great Emperor.
      His gratitude to the hero was boundless, his devotion blind, his
      enthusiasm founded upon reason, his affection warm as the most sincere and
      passionate friendship. But this was not all.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the emperor, in a burst of joy and paternal tenderness, had led
      the marshal to the cradle of the sleeping King of Rome, and said to him,
      as he proudly pointed to the beautiful child: &ldquo;My old friend, swear
      to me that you will serve the son as you have served the father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30293m.jpg" alt="30293m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30293.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Marshal Simon took and kept that vow. During the Restoration, the chief of
      a military conspiracy in favor of Napoleon II., he had attempted in vain
      to secure a regiment of cavalry, at that time commanded by the Marquis d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      Betrayed and denounced, the marshal, after a desperate duel with the
      future Jesuit, had succeeded in reaching Poland, and thus escaping a
      sentence of death. It is useless to repeat the series of events which led
      the marshal from Poland to India, and then brought him back to Paris after
      the Revolution of July&mdash;an epoch at which a number of his old
      comrades in arms had solicited and obtained from the government, without
      his knowledge, the confirmation of the rank and title which the emperor
      had bestowed upon him just before Waterloo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Paris, after his long exile, in spite of all the
      happiness he felt in at length embracing his children, Marshal Simon was
      deeply affected on learning the death of their mother, whom he adored.
      Till the last moment, he had hoped to find her in Paris. The
      disappointment was dreadful, and he felt it cruelly, though he sought
      consolation in his children&rsquo;s affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon new causes of trouble and anxiety were interwoven with his life
      by the machinations of Rodin. Thanks to the secret intrigues of the
      reverend father at the Courts of Rome and Vienna, one of his emissaries,
      in a condition to inspire full confidence, and provided with undeniable
      evidence to support his words, went to Marshal Simon, and said to him:
      &ldquo;The son of the emperor is dying, the victim of the fears with which
      the name of Napoleon still inspires Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From this slow expiring, you, Marshal Simon, one of the emperor&rsquo;s
      most faithful friends, are able to rescue this unfortunate prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The correspondence in my hand proves that it would be easy to open
      relations, of the surest and most secret nature, with one of the most
      influential persons about the King of Rome, and this person would be
      disposed to favor the prince&rsquo;s escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible, by a bold, unexpected stroke, to deliver Napoleon
      II. from the custody of Austria, which would leave him to perish by inches
      in an atmosphere that is fatal to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The enterprise may be a rash one, but it has chances of success
      that you Marshal Simon, more than any other, could change into
      certainties; for your devotion to the emperor is well known, and we
      remember with what adventurous audacity you conspired, in 1815, in favor
      of Napoleon II.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of languor and decline of the King of Rome was then in France a
      matter of public notoriety. People even went so far as to affirm that the
      son of the hero was carefully trained by priests, who kept him in complete
      ignorance of the glory of his paternal name; and that, by the most
      execrable machinations, they strove day by day to extinguish every noble
      and generous instinct that displayed itself in the unfortunate youth. The
      coldest hearts were touched and softened at the story of so sad and fatal
      a destiny. When we remember the heroic character and chivalrous loyalty of
      Marshal Simon, and his passionate devotion to the emperor, we can
      understand how the father of Rose and Blanche was more interested than any
      one else in the fate of the young prince, and how, if occasion offered, he
      would feel himself obliged not to confine his efforts to mere regrets.
      With regard to the reality of the correspondence produced by Rodin&rsquo;s
      emissary, it had been submitted by the marshal to a searching test, by
      means of his intimacy with one of his old companions in arms, who had been
      for a long period on a mission to Vienna, in the time of the empire. The
      result of this investigation, conducted with as much prudence as address,
      so that nothing should transpire, showed that the marshal might give his
      serious attention to the advances made him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, this proposition threw the father of Rose and Blanche into a cruel
      perplexity; for, to attempt so bold and dangerous an enterprise, he must
      once more abandon his children; whilst, on the contrary, if, alarmed at
      this separation, he renounced the endeavor to save the King of Rome, whose
      lingering death was perfectly true and well authenticated, the marshal
      would consider himself as false to the vow he had sworn to the emperor. To
      end these painful hesitations, full of confidence in the inflexible
      uprightness of his father&rsquo;s character, the marshal had gone to ask
      his advice; unfortunately the old republican workman, mortally wounded
      during the attack on M. Hardy&rsquo;s factory, but still pondering over
      the serious communication of his son, died with these words upon his Lips:
      &ldquo;My son, you have a great duty to perform, under pain of not acting
      like a man of honor, and of disobeying my last will. You must, without
      hesitation&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, by a deplorable fatality, the last words, which would have completed
      the sense of the old workman&rsquo;s thought, were spoken in so feeble a
      voice as to be quite unintelligible. He died, leaving Marshal Simon in a
      worse state of anxiety, as one of the two courses open to him had now been
      formally condemned by his father, in whose judgment he had the most
      implicit and merited confidence. In a word, his mind was now tortured by
      the doubt whether his father had intended, in the name of honor and duty,
      to advise him not to abandon his children, to engage in so hazardous an
      enterprise, or whether, on the contrary, he had wished him to leave them
      for a time, to perform the vow made to the emperor, and endeavor at least
      to rescue Napoleon II. from a captivity that might soon be mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      This perplexity, rendered more cruel by certain circumstances, to be
      related hereafter, the tragical death of his father, who had expired in
      his arms; the incessant and painful remembrance of his wife, who had
      perished in a land of exile; and finally, the grief he felt at perceiving
      the overgrowing sadness of Rose and Blanche, occasioned severe shocks to
      Marshal Simon. Let us add that, in spite of his natural intrepidity, so
      nobly proved by twenty years of war, the ravages of the cholera, the same
      terrible malady to which his wife had fallen a victim in Siberia, filled
      the marshal with involuntary dread. Yes, this man of iron nerves, who had
      coolly braved death in so many battles, felt the habitual firmness of his
      character give way at sight of the scenes of desolation and mourning which
      Paris offered at every step. Yet, when Mdlle. de Cardoville gathered round
      her the members of her family, to warn them against the plot of their
      enemies, the affectionate tenderness of Adrienne for Rose and Blanche
      appeared to exercise so happy an influence on their mysterious sorrow,
      that the marshal, forgetting for a moment his fatal regrets, thought only
      of enjoying this blessed change, which, alas! was but of short duration.
      Having now recalled these facts to the mind of the reader, we shall
      continue our story.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. THE BLOCKHEAD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e have stated that
      Marshal Simon occupied a small house in the Rue des Trois-Freres. Two o&rsquo;clock
      in the afternoon had just struck in the marshal&rsquo;s sleeping-chamber,
      a room furnished with military simplicity. In the recess, in which stood
      the bed, hung a trophy composed of the arms used by the marshal during his
      campaigns. On the secretary opposite was a small bronze bust of the
      emperor, the only ornament of the apartment. Out of doors the temperature
      was far from warm, and the marshal had become susceptible to cold during
      his long residence in India. A good fire therefore blazed upon the hearth.
      A door, concealed by the hangings, and leading to a back staircase, opened
      slowly, and a man entered the chamber. He carried a basket of wood, and
      advanced leisurely to the fireplace, before which he knelt clown, and
      began to arrange the logs symmetrically in a box that stood besides the
      hearth. After some minutes occupied in this manner, still kneeling, he
      gradually approached another door, at a little distance from the chimney,
      and appeared to listen with deep attention, as if he wished to hear what
      was passing in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, employed as an inferior servant in the house, had the most
      ridiculously stupid look that can be imagined. His functions consisted in
      carrying wood, running errands, etc. In other respects he was a kind of
      laughing-stock to the other servants. In a moment of good humor, Dagobert,
      who filled the post of major-domo, had given this idiot the name of
      &ldquo;Loony&rdquo; (lunatic), which he had retained ever since, and which
      he deserved in every respect, as well for his awkwardness and folly as for
      his unmeaning face, with its grotesquely flat nose, sloping chin, and
      wide, staring eyes. Add to this description a jacket of red stuff, and a
      triangular white apron, and we must acknowledge that the simpleton was
      quite worthy of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, at the moment when Loony listened so attentively at the door of the
      adjoining room, a ray of quick intelligence animated for an instant his
      dull and stupid countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had thus listened for a short time, Loony returned to the
      fireplace, still crawling on his knees; then rising, he again took his
      basket half full of wood, and once more approaching the door at which he
      had listened knocked discreetly. No one answered. He knocked a second
      time, and more loudly. Still there was the same silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said, in a harsh, squeaking, laughable voice: &ldquo;Ladies, do
      you want any wood, if you please, for your fire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving no answer, Loony placed his basket on the ground, opened the
      door gently, and entered the next room, after casting a rapid glance
      around. He came out again in a few seconds, looking from side to side with
      an anxious air, like a man who had just accomplished some important and
      mysterious task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking up his basket, he was about to leave Marshal Simon&rsquo;s room,
      when the door of the private staircase was opened slowly and with
      precaution, and Dagobert appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, evidently surprised at the servant&rsquo;s presence, knitted
      his brows, and exclaimed abruptly, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sudden interrogation, accompanied by a growl expressive of the
      ill-humor of Spoil-sport, who followed close on his master&rsquo;s heels,
      Loony uttered a cry of real or pretended terror. To give, perhaps, an
      appearance of greater reality to his dread, the supposed simpleton let his
      basket fall on the ground, as if astonishment and fear had loosened his
      hold of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, numbskull?&rdquo; resumed Dagobert, whose
      countenance was impressed with deep sadness, and who seemed little
      disposed to laugh at the fellow&rsquo;s stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Dagobert! how you frighten me! Dear me! what a pity I had
      not an armful of plates, to prove it was not my fault if I broke them all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask what you are doing,&rdquo; resumed the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, M. Dagobert,&rdquo; replied Loony, pointing to his basket,
      &ldquo;that I came with some wood to master&rsquo;s room, so that he might
      burn it, if it was cold&mdash;which it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Pick up your wood, and begone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Dagobert! my legs tremble under me. How you did scare me, to
      be sure!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you begone, brute?&rdquo; resumed the veteran; and seizing
      Loony by the arm, he pushed him towards the door, while Spoil-sport, with
      recumbent ears, and hair standing up like the quills of a porcupine,
      seemed inclined to accelerate his retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, M. Dagobert, I am going,&rdquo; replied the simpleton,
      as he hastily gathered up his basket; &ldquo;only please to tell the dog&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil, you stupid chatterbox!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, as
      he pushed Loony through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the soldier bolted the door which led to the private staircase, and
      going to that which communicated with the apartments of the two sisters,
      he double-locked it. Having done this, he hastened to the alcove in which
      stood the bed and taking down a pair of loaded pistols, he carefully
      removed the percussion caps, and, unable to repress a deep sigh, restored
      the weapons to the place in which he had found them. Then, as if on second
      thoughts, he took down an Indian dagger with a very sharp blade, and
      drawing it from its silver-gilt sheath, proceeded to break the point of
      this murderous instrument, by twisting it beneath one of the iron castors
      of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert then proceeded to unfasten the two doors, and, returning slowly
      to the marble chimney-piece, he leaned against it with a gloomy and
      pensive air. Crouching before the fire, Spoil-sport followed with an
      attentive eye the least movement of his master. The good dog displayed a
      rare and intelligent sagacity. The soldier, having drawn out his
      handkerchief, let fall, without perceiving it, a paper containing a roll
      of tobacco. Spoil-sport, who had all the qualities of a retriever of the
      Rutland race, took the paper between his teeth, and, rising upon his
      hind-legs, presented it respectfully to Dagobert. But the latter received
      it mechanically, and appeared indifferent to the dexterity of his dog. The
      grenadier&rsquo;s countenance revealed as much sorrow as anxiety. After
      remaining for some minutes near the fire, with fixed and meditative look,
      he began to walk about the room in great agitation, one of his hands
      thrust into the bosom of his long blue frock-coat, which was buttoned up
      to the chin, and the other into one of his hind-pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time he stopped abruptly, and seemed to make reply to his own
      thoughts, or uttered an exclamation of doubt and uneasiness; then, turning
      towards the trophy of arms, he shook his head mournfully, and murmured,
      &ldquo;No matter&mdash;this fear may be idle; but he has acted so
      extraordinarily these two days, that it is at all events more prudent&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued his walk, and said, after a new and prolonged silence:
      &ldquo;Yes he must tell me. It makes me too uneasy. And then the poor
      children&mdash;it is enough to break one&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dagobert hastily drew his moustache between his thumb and forefinger,
      a nervous movement, which with him was an evident symptom of extreme
      agitation. Some minutes after, the soldier resumed, still answering his
      inward thoughts: &ldquo;What can it be? It is hardly possible to be the
      letters, they are too infamous; he despises them. And yet But no, no&mdash;he
      is above that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dagobert again began to walk with hasty steps. Suddenly, Spoil-sport
      pricked up his ears, turned his head in the direction of the staircase
      door, and growled hoarsely. A few seconds after, some one knocked at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said Dagobert. There was no answer, but the
      person knocked again. Losing patience, the soldier went hastily to open
      it, and saw the servant&rsquo;s stupid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer, when I ask who knocks!&rdquo; said the
      soldier, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert, you sent me away just now, and I was afraid of making
      you cross, if I said I had come again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want? Speak then&mdash;come in, stupid!&rdquo; cried
      the exasperated. Dagobert, as he pulled him into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert, don&rsquo;t be angry&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you all
      about it&mdash;it is a young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to speak to you directly, Mr. Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name, M. Dagobert?&rdquo; replied Loony, rolling about and
      laughing with an idiotic air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his name. Speak, idiot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, M. Dagobert! it&rsquo;s all in joke that you ask me his name!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are determined, fool that you are, to drive me out of my
      senses!&rdquo; cried the soldier, seizing Loony by the collar. &ldquo;The
      name of this young man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, M. Dagobert. I didn&rsquo;t tell you the name
      because you know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beast!&rdquo; said Dagobert, shaking his fist at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do know it, M. Dagobert, for the young man is your own
      son. He is downstairs, and wants to speak to you directly&mdash;yes,
      directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stupidity was so well assumed, that Dagobert was the dupe of it. Moved
      to compassion rather than anger by such imbecility, he looked fixedly at
      the servant, shrugged his shoulders, and said, as he advanced towards the
      staircase, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Loony obeyed; but, before closing the door, he drew a letter secretly from
      his pocket, and dropped it behind him without turning his head, saying all
      the while to Dagobert, for the purpose of occupying his attention: &ldquo;Your
      son is in the court, M. Dagobert. He would not come up&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      why he is still downstairs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus talking, he closed the door, believing he had left the letter on the
      floor of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s room. But he had reckoned without
      Spoil-sport. Whether he thought it more prudent to bring up the rear, or,
      from respectful deference for a biped, the worthy dog had been the last to
      leave the room, and, being a famous carrier, as soon as he saw the letter
      dropped by Loony, he took it delicately between his teeth, and followed
      close on the heels of the servant, without the latter perceiving this new
      proof of the intelligence and sagacity of Spoil-sport.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. THE ANONYMOUS LETTERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will explain
      presently what became of the letter, which Spoil-sport held between his
      teeth, and why he left his master, when the latter ran to meet Agricola.
      Dagobert had not seen his son for some days. Embracing him cordially, he
      led him into one of the rooms on the ground floor, which he usually
      occupied. &ldquo;And how is your wife?&rdquo; said the soldier to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is well, father, thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving a great change in Agricola&rsquo;s countenance, Dagobert
      resumed: &ldquo;You look sad. Has anything gone wrong since I saw you
      last?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is over, father. We have lost him,&rdquo; said the smith, in a
      tone of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Hardy!&mdash;why, three days ago, you told me you were going to
      see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, I have seen him&mdash;and my dear brother Gabriel saw
      him and spoke to him&mdash;how he speaks! with a voice that comes from the
      heart!&mdash;and he had so revived and encouraged him, that M. Hardy
      consented to return amongst us. Then I, wild with joy, ran to tell the
      good news to some of my mates, who were waiting to hear the result of nay
      interview with M. Hardy. I brought them all with me to thank and bless
      him. We were within a hundred yards of the house belonging to the
      black-gowns&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ali, the black-gowns!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with a gloomy air.
      &ldquo;Then some mischief will happen. I know them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not mistaken, father,&rdquo; answered Agricola, with a
      sigh. &ldquo;I was running on with my comrades, when I saw a carriage
      coming towards us. Some presentiment told me that they were taking away M.
      Hardy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By force!&rdquo; said Dagobert, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Agricola, bitterly; &ldquo;no&mdash;the priests
      are too cunning for that. They know how to make you an accomplice in the
      evil they do you. Shall I not always remember how they managed with my
      good mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the worthy woman! there was a poor fly caught in the spider&rsquo;s
      web. But this carriage, of which you speak?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On seeing it start from the house of the black-gowns,&rdquo;
      replied Agricola, &ldquo;my heart sank within me; and, by an impulse
      stronger than myself, I rushed to the horses&rsquo; heads, calling on my
      comrades to help me. But the postilion knocked me down and stunned me with
      a blow from his whip. When I recovered my senses, the carriage was already
      far away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not hurt?&rdquo; cried Dagobert, anxiously, as he examined
      his son from top to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father; a mere scratch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you next, my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hastened to our good angel, Mdlle. de Cardoville, and told her
      all. &lsquo;You must follow M. Hardy on the instant,&rsquo; said she to
      me. &lsquo;Take my carriage and post-horses. Dupont will accompany you;
      follow M. Hardy from stage to stage; should you succeed in overtaking him
      your presence and your prayers may perhaps conquer the fatal influence
      that these priests have acquired over him.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the best advice she could give you. That excellent young
      lady is always right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour after, we were upon our way, for we learned by the returned
      postilions, that M. Hardy had taken the Orleans road. We followed him as
      far as Etampes. There we heard that he had taken a cross-road, to reach a
      solitary house in a valley about four leagues from the highway. They told
      us that this house called the Val-de-St. Herem, belonged to certain
      priests, and that, as the night was so dark, and the road so bad, we had
      better sleep at the inn, and start early in the morning. We followed this
      advice, and set out at dawn. In a quarter of an hour, we quitted the
      high-road for a mountainous and desert track. We saw nothing but brown
      rocks, and a few birch trees. As we advanced, the scene became wilder and
      wilder. We might have fancied ourselves a hundred leagues from Paris. At
      last we stopped in front of a large, old, black-looking house with only a
      few small windows in it, and built at the foot of a high, rocky mountain.
      In my whole life I have never seen anything so deserted and sad. We got
      out of the carriage, and I rang the bell. A man opened the door. &lsquo;Did
      not the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny arrive here last night with a gentleman?&rsquo;
      said I to this man, with a confidential air. &lsquo;Inform the gentleman
      directly, that I come on business of importance, and that I must see him
      forthwith.&rsquo;&mdash;The man, believing me an accomplice, showed us in
      immediately; a moment after, the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny opened the door,
      saw me, and drew back; yet, in five minutes more, I was in presence of M.
      Hardy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Dagobert, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agricola shook his head sorrowfully, and replied: &ldquo;I knew by the
      very countenance of M. Hardy, that all was over. Addressing me in a mild
      but firm voice, he said to me: &lsquo;I understand, I can even excuse, the
      motives that bring you hither. But I am quite determined to live
      henceforth in solitude and prayer. I take this resolution freely and
      voluntarily, because I would fain provide for the salvation of my soul.
      Tell your fellows that my arrangements will be such as to leave them a
      good remembrance of me.&rsquo;&mdash;And as I was about to speak, M. Hardy
      interrupted me, saying: &lsquo;It is useless, my friend. My determination
      is unalterable. Do not write to me, for your letters would remain
      unanswered. Prayer will henceforth be my only occupation. Excuse me for
      leaving you, but I am fatigued from my journey!&rsquo;&mdash;He spoke the
      truth for he was as pale as a spectre, with a kind of wildness about the
      eyes, and so changed since the day before, as to be hardly the same man.
      His hand, when he offered it on parting from me, was dry and burning. The
      Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny soon came in. &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said M. Hardy to
      him, &lsquo;have the goodness to see M. Baudoin to the door.&rsquo;&mdash;So
      saying, he waved his hand to me in token of farewell, and retired to the
      next chamber. All was over; he is lost to us forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dagobert, &ldquo;those black-gowns have enchanted
      him, like so many others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In despair,&rdquo; resumed Agricola, &ldquo;I returned hither with
      M. Dupont. This, then, is what the priests have made of M. Hardy&mdash;of
      that generous man, who supported nearly three hundred industrious workmen
      in order and happiness, increasing their knowledge, improving their
      hearts, and earning the benediction of that little people, of which he was
      the providence. Instead of all this, M. Hardy is now forever reduced to a
      gloomy and unavailing life of contemplation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the black-gowns!&rdquo; said Dagobert, shuddering, and unable
      to conceal a vague sense of fear. &ldquo;The longer I live, the more I am
      afraid of them. You have seen what those people did to your poor mother;
      you see what they have just done to M. Hardy; you know their plots against
      my two poor orphans, and against that generous young lady. Oh, these
      people are very powerful! I would rather face a battalion of Russian
      grenadiers, than a dozen of these cassocks. But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
      talk of it. I have causes enough beside for grief and fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing the astonished look of Agricola, the soldier, unable to
      restrain his emotion, threw himself into the arms of his son, exclaiming
      with a choking voice: &ldquo;I can hold out no longer. My heart is too
      full. I must speak; and whom shall I trust if not you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you frighten me!&rdquo; said Agricola, &ldquo;What is the
      matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, had it not been for you and the two poor girls, I
      should have blown out my brains twenty times over rather than see what I
      see&mdash;and dread what I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you dread, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the last few days, I do not know what has come over the
      marshal&mdash;but he frightens me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet in his last interviews with Mdlle. de Cardoville&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was a little better. By her kind words, this generous young
      lady poured balm into his wounds; the presence of the young Indian cheered
      him; he appeared to shake off his cares, and his poor little girls felt
      the benefit of the change. But for some days, I know not what demon has
      been loosed against his family. It is enough to turn one&rsquo;s head.
      First of all, I am sure that the anonymous letters have begun again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letters, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The anonymous letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are they about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how the marshal hated that renegade, the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      When he found that the traitor was here, and that he had persecuted the
      two orphans, even as he persecuted their mother to the death&mdash;but
      that now he had become a priest&mdash;I thought the marshal would have
      gone mad with indignation and fury. He wishes to go in search of the
      renegade. With one word I calmed him. &lsquo;He is a priest,&rsquo; I
      said; &lsquo;you may do what you will, insult or strike him&mdash;he will
      not fight. He began by serving against his country, he ends by becoming a
      bad priest. It is all in character. He is not worth spitting upon.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But
      surely I may punish the wrong done to my children, and avenge the death of
      my wife,&rsquo; cried the marshal, much exasperated.&mdash;&lsquo;They
      say, as you well know, that there are courts of law to avenge your wrongs,&rsquo;
      answered I; &lsquo;Mdlle. de Cardoville has lodged a charge against the
      renegade, for having attempted to confine your daughters in a convent. We
      must champ the bit and wait.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Agricola, mournfully, &ldquo;and unfortunately
      there lacks proof to bring it home to the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny. The other
      day, when I was examined by Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s lawyer, with
      regard to our attempt on the convent, he told me that we should meet with
      obstacles at every step, for want of legal evidence, and that the priests
      had taken their precautions with so much skill that the indictment would
      be quashed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what the marshal thinks, my boy, and this increases
      his irritation at such injustice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should despise the wretches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the anonymous letters!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of them, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know all. A brave and honorable man like the marshal,
      when his first movement of indignation was over, felt that to insult the
      renegade disguised in the garb of a priest, would be like insulting an old
      man or a woman. He determined therefore to despise him, and to forget him
      as soon as possible. But then, almost every day, there came by the post
      anonymous letters, in which all sorts of devices were employed, to revive
      and excite the anger of the marshal against the renegade by reminding him
      of all the evil contrived by the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny against him and his
      family. The marshal was reproached with cowardice for not taking vengeance
      on this priest, the persecutor of his wife and children, the insolent
      mocker at his misfortunes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from whom do you suspect these letters to come, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell&mdash;it is that which turns one&rsquo;s brain. They
      must come from the enemies of the marshal, and he has no enemies but the
      black-gowns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, since these letters are to excite his anger against
      the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny, they can hardly have been written by priests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I have said to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what, then, can be their object?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their object? oh, it is too plain!&rdquo; cried Dagobert. &ldquo;The
      marshal is hasty, ardent; he has a thousand reasons to desire vengeance on
      the renegade. But he cannot do himself justice, and the other sort of
      justice fails him. Then what does he do? He endeavors to forget, he
      forgets. But every day there comes to him an insolent letter, to provoke
      and exasperate his legitimate hatred, by mockeries and insults. Devil take
      me! my head is not the weakest&mdash;but, at such a game, I should go mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, such a plot would be horrible, and only worthy of hell!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marshal has received other letters; those he has not shown me&mdash;but,
      after he had read the first, he remained like a man struck motionless, and
      murmured to himself: &lsquo;They do not even respect that&mdash;oh! it is
      too much&mdash;too much!&rsquo;&mdash;And, hiding his face in his hands he
      wept.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marshal wept!&rdquo; cried the blacksmith, hardly able to
      believe what he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dagobert, &ldquo;he wept like a child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what could these letters contain, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not venture to ask him, he appeared so miserable and
      dejected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thus harassed and tormented incessantly, the marshal must lead
      a wretched life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his poor little girls too! he sees them grow sadder and sadder,
      without being able to guess the cause. And the death of his father, killed
      almost in his arms! Perhaps, you will think all this enough; but, no! I am
      sure there is something still more painful behind. Lately, you would
      hardly know the marshal. He is irritable about nothing, and falls into
      such fits of passion, that&mdash;&rdquo; After a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation, the soldier resumed: &ldquo;I way tell this to you, my poor
      boy. I have just been upstairs, to take the caps from his pistols.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, father!&rdquo; cried Agricola; &ldquo;you fear&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the state of exasperation in which I saw him yesterday, there is
      everything to fear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since some time, he has often long secret interviews with a
      gentleman, who looks like an old soldier and a worthy man. I have remarked
      that the gloom and agitation of the marshal are always redoubled after one
      of these visits. Two or three times, I have spoken to him about it; but I
      saw by his look, that I displeased him, and therefore I desisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! yesterday, this gentleman came in the evening. He remained
      here until eleven o&rsquo;clock, and his wife came to fetch him, and
      waited for him in a coach. After his departure, I went up to see if the
      marshal wanted anything. He was very pale, but calm; he thanked me, and I
      came down again. You know that my room is just under his. I could hear the
      marshal walking about as if much agitated, and soon after he seemed to be
      knocking down the furniture. In alarm, I once more went upstairs. He asked
      me, with an irritated air, what I wanted, and ordered me to leave the
      room. Seeing him in that way, I remained; he grew more angry, still I
      remained; perceiving a chair and table thrown down, I pointed to them with
      so sad an air that he understood me. You know that he has the best heart
      in the world, so, taking me by the hand, he said to me: &lsquo;Forgive me
      for causing you this uneasiness, my good Dagobert; but just now, I lost my
      senses, and gave way to a burst of absurd fury; I think I should have
      thrown myself out of the window, had it been open. I only hope, that my
      poor dear girls have not heard me,&rsquo; added he, as he went on tip-toe
      to open the door which communicates with his daughters&rsquo; bedroom.
      When he had listened anxiously for a moment, he returned to me, and said:
      &lsquo;Luckily, they are asleep.&rsquo;&mdash;Then I asked him what was
      the cause of his agitation, and if, in spite of my precautions, he had
      received any more anonymous letters. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied he, with a
      gloomy air; &lsquo;but leave me, my friend. I am now better. It has done
      me good to see you. Good&mdash;night, old comrade! go downstairs to bed.&rsquo;&mdash;I
      took care not to contradict him; but, pretending to go down, I came up
      again, and seated myself on the top stair, listening. No doubt, to calm
      himself entirely, the marshal went to embrace his children, for I heard
      him open and shut their door. Then he returned to his room, and walked
      about for a long time, but with a more quiet step. At last, I heard him
      throw himself on his bed, and I came down about break of day. After that,
      all remained tranquil.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;But whatever can be the matter with him, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. When I went up to him, I was astonished at the
      agitation of his countenance, and the brilliancy of his eyes. He would
      have looked much the same, had he been delirious, or in a burning fever&mdash;so
      that, when I heard him say, he could have thrown himself out of the
      window, had it been open, I thought it more prudent to remove the caps
      from his pistols.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand it!&rdquo; said Agricola. &ldquo;So firm,
      intrepid, and cool a man as the marshal, a prey to such violence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that something very extraordinary is passing within him.
      For two days, he has not been to see his children, which is always a bad
      sign with him&mdash;to say nothing of the poor little angels themselves,
      who are miserable at the notion that they have displeased their father.
      They displease him! If you only knew the life they lead, dear creatures! a
      walk or ride with me and their companion, for I never let them go out
      alone, and, the rest of their time, at their studies, reading, or
      needlework&mdash;always together&mdash;and then to bed. Yet their duenna,
      who is, I think, a worthy woman, tells me that sometimes at night, she has
      seen them shed tears in their sleep. Poor children! they have hitherto
      known but little happiness,&rdquo; added the soldier, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, hearing some one walk hastily across the courtyard,
      Dagobert raised his eyes, and saw Marshal Simon, with pale face and
      bewildered air, holding in his two hands a letter, which he seemed to read
      with devouring anxiety.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. THE GOLDEN CITY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile Marshal Simon
      was crossing the little court with so agitated an air, reading the
      anonymous letter, which he had received by Spoil-sport&rsquo;s unexpected
      medium, Rose and Blanche were alone together, in the sitting room they
      usually occupied, which had been entered for a moment by Loony during
      their absence. The poor children seemed destined to a succession of
      sorrows. At the moment their mourning for their mother drew near its
      close, the tragical death of their grandfather had again dressed them in
      funereal weeds. They were seated together upon a couch, in front of their
      work-table. Grief often produces the effect of years. Hence, in a few
      months, Rose and Blanche had become quite young women. To the infantine
      grace of their charming faces, formerly so plump and rosy, but now pale
      and thin, had succeeded an expression of grave and touching sadness. Their
      large, mild eyes of limpid azure, which always had a dreamy character,
      were now never bathed in those joyous tears, with which a burst of frank
      and hearty laughter used of old to adorn their silky lashes, when the
      comic coolness of Dagobert, or some funny trick of Spoil-sport, cheered
      them in the course of their long and weary pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, those delightful faces, which the flowery pencil of Greuze
      could alone have painted in all their velvet freshness, were now worthy of
      inspiring the melancholy ideal of the immortal Ary Scheffer, who gave us
      Mignon aspiring to Paradise, and Margaret dreaming of Faust. Rose, leaning
      back on the couch, held her head somewhat bowed upon her bosom, over which
      was crossed a handkerchief of black crape. The light streaming from a
      window opposite, shone softly on her pure, white forehead, crowned by two
      thick bands of chestnut hair. Her look was fixed, and the open arch of her
      eyebrows, now somewhat contracted, announced a mind occupied with painful
      thoughts. Her thin, white little hands had fallen upon her knees, but
      still held the embroidery, on which she had been engaged. The profile of
      Blanche was visible, leaning a little towards her sister, with an
      expression of tender and anxious solicitude, whilst her needle remained in
      the canvas, as if she had just ceased to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Blanche, in a low voice, after some moments of
      silence, during which the tears seemed to mount to her eyes, &ldquo;tell
      me what you are thinking of. You look so sad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of the Golden City of our dreams,&rdquo; replied Rose,
      almost in a whisper, after another short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche understood the bitterness of these words. Without speaking, she
      threw herself on her sister&rsquo;s neck, and wept. Poor girls! the Golden
      City of their dreams was Paris, with their father in it&mdash;Paris, the
      marvellous city of joys and festivals, through all of which the orphans
      had beheld the radiant and smiling countenance of their sire! But, alas!
      the Beautiful City had been changed into a place of tears, and death, and
      mourning. The same terrible pestilence which had struck down their mother
      in the heart of Siberia, seemed to have followed them like a dark and
      fatal cloud, which, always hovering above them, hid the mild blue of the
      sky, and the joyous light of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Golden City of their dreams! It was the place, where perhaps one day
      their father would present to them two young lovers, good and fair as
      themselves. &ldquo;They love you,&rdquo; he was to say; &ldquo;they are
      worthy of you. Let each of you have a brother, and me two sons.&rdquo;
      Then what chaste, enchanting confusion for those two orphans, whose
      hearts, pure as crystal, had never reflected any image but that of
      Gabriel, the celestial messenger sent by their mother to protect them!
    </p>
    <p>
      We can therefore understand the painful emotion of Blanche, when she heard
      her sister repeat, with bitter melancholy, those words which described
      their whole situation: &ldquo;I think of the Golden City of our dreams!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; proceeded Blanche, drying her sister&rsquo;s
      tears; &ldquo;perhaps, happiness may yet be in store for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! if we are not happy with our father by us&mdash;shall we ever
      be so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when we rejoin our mother,&rdquo; said Blanche, lifting her
      eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sister, this dream may be a warning&mdash;it is so like that
      we had in Germany.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difference being that then the Angel Gabriel came down from
      heaven to us, and that this time he takes us from earth, to our mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this dream will perhaps come true, like the other, my sister.
      We dreamt that the Angel Gabriel would protect us, and he came to save us
      from the shipwreck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, this time, we dream that he will lead us to heaven. Why should
      not that happen also?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to bring that about, sister, our Gabriel, who saved us from the
      shipwreck, must die also. No, no; that must not happen. Let us pray that
      it may not happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it will not happen&mdash;for it is only Gabriel&rsquo;s good
      angel, who is so like him, that we saw in our dreams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, dear, how singular is this dream!&mdash;Here, as in
      Germany, we have both dreamt the same&mdash;three times, the very same!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. The Angel Gabriel bent over us, and looked at us with
      so mild and sad an air, saying: &lsquo;Come, my children! come, my
      sisters! Your mother waits for you. Poor children, arrived from so far!&rsquo;
      added he in his tender voice: &lsquo;You have passed over the earth,
      gentle and innocent as two doves, to repose forever in the maternal nest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, those were the words of the archangel,&rdquo; said the other
      orphan, with a pensive air; &ldquo;we have done no harm to any one, and we
      have loved those who loved us&mdash;why should we fear to die?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, dear sister, we rather smiled than wept, when he took us
      by the hand, and, spreading wide his beautiful white wings, carried us
      along with him to the blue depths of the sky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To heaven, where our dear mother waited for us with open arms, her
      face all bathed in tears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sweet sister! one has not dreams like ours for nothing. And
      then,&rdquo; added she, looking at Rose, with a sad smile that went to the
      heart, &ldquo;our death might perhaps end the sorrow, of which we have
      been the cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is not our fault. We love him so much. But we are so timid
      and sorrowful before him, that he may perhaps think we love him not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rose took her handkerchief from her workbasket, to dry her
      fears; a paper, folded in the form of a letter, fell out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sight, the two shuddered, and pressed close to one mother, and
      Rose said to Blanche, in a trembling voice: &ldquo;Another of these
      letters!&mdash;Oh, I am afraid! It will doubtless be like the last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must pick it up quickly, that it may not be seen,&rdquo; said
      Blanche, hastily stooping to seize the letter; &ldquo;the people who take
      interest in us might otherwise be exposed to great danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could this letter come to us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did the others come to be placed right under our hand, and
      always in the absence of our duenna?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. Why seek to explain the mystery? We should never be
      able to do so. Let us read the letter. It will perhaps be more favorable
      to us than the last.&rdquo; And the two sisters read as follows:-&ldquo;Continue
      to love your father, dear children, for he is very miserable, and you are
      the involuntary cause of his distress. You will never know the terrible
      sacrifices that your presence imposes on him; but, alas! he is the victim
      of his paternal duties. His sufferings are more cruel than ever; spare him
      at least those marks of tenderness, which occasion him so much more pain
      than pleasure. Each caress is a dagger-stroke, for he sees in you the
      innocent cause of his misfortunes. Dear children, you must not therefore
      despair. If you have enough command over yourselves, not to torture him by
      the display of too warm a tenderness, if you can mingle some reserve with
      your affection, you will greatly alleviate his sorrow. Keep these letters
      a secret from every one, even from good Dagobert, who loves you so much;
      otherwise, both he and you, your father, and the unknown friend who is
      writing to you, will be exposed to the utmost peril, for your enemies are
      indeed formidable. Courage and hope! May your father&rsquo;s tenderness be
      once more free from sorrow and regret!&mdash;That happy day is perhaps not
      so far distant. Burn this letter like all the others!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The above note was written with so much cunning that, even supposing the
      orphans had communicated it to their father or Dagobert, it would at the
      worst have been considered a strange, intrusive proceeding, but almost
      excusable from the spirit in which it was conceived. Nothing could have
      been contrived with more perfidious art, if we consider the cruel
      perplexity in which Marshal Simon was struggling between the fear of again
      leaving his children and the shame of neglecting what he considered a
      sacred duty. All the tenderness, all the susceptibility of heart which
      distinguished the orphans, had been called into play by these diabolical
      counsels, and the sisters soon perceived that their presence was in fact
      both sweet and painful to their father; for sometimes he felt himself
      incapable of leaving them, and sometimes the thought of a neglected duty
      spread a cloud of sadness over his brow. Hence the poor twins could not
      fail to value the fatal meaning of the anonymous letters they received.
      They were persuaded that, from some mysterious motive, which they were
      unable to penetrate, their presence was often importunate and even painful
      to their father. Hence the growing sadness of Rose and Blanche&mdash;hence
      the sort of fear and reserve which restrained the expression of their
      filial tenderness. A most painful situation for the marshal, who deceived
      by inexplicable appearances, mistook, in his turn, their manner of
      indifference to him&mdash;and so, with breaking heart, and bitter grief
      upon his face, often abruptly quitted his children to conceal his tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the desponding orphans said to each other: &ldquo;We are the cause of
      our father&rsquo;s grief. It is our presence which makes him so unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may new judge what ravages such a thought, when fixed and
      incessant, must have made on these young, loving, timid, and simple
      hearts. Haw could the orphans be on their guard against such anonymous
      communications, which spoke with reverence of all they loved, and seemed
      every day justified by the conduct of their father? Already victims of
      numerous plots, and hearing that they were surrounded by enemies, we can
      understand, how faithful to the advice of their unknown friend, they
      forbore to confide to Dagobert these letters, in which he was so justly
      appreciated. The object of the proceeding was very plain. By continually
      harassing the marshal on all sides, and persuading him of the coldness of
      his children, the conspirators might naturally hope to conquer the
      hesitation which had hitherto prevented his again quitting his daughters
      to embark in a dangerous enterprise. To render the marshal&rsquo;s life so
      burdensome that he would desire to seek relief from his torments in airy
      project of daring and generous chivalry, was one of the ends proposed by
      Rodin&mdash;and, as we have seen, it wanted neither logic nor possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having read the letter, the two remained for a moment silent and
      dejected. Then Rose, who held the paper in her hand, started up suddenly,
      approached the chimneypiece, and threw the letter into the fire, saying,
      with a timid air: &ldquo;We must burn it quickly, or perhaps some great
      danger will ensue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What greater misfortune can happen to us,&rdquo; said Blanche,
      despondingly, &ldquo;than to cause such sorrow to our father? What can be
      the reason of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Rose, whose tears were slowly trickling down
      her cheek, &ldquo;he does not find us what he could have desired. He may
      love us well as the children of our poor mother, but we are not the
      daughters he had dreamed of. Do you understand me, sister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;that is perhaps what occasioned all his sorrow. We
      are so badly informed, so wild, so awkward, that he is no doubt ashamed of
      us; and, as he loves us in spite of all, it makes him suffer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is not our fault. Our dear mother brought us up in the
      deserts of Siberia as well as she could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! father himself does not reproach us with it; only it gives him
      pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly if he has friends whose daughters are very beautiful,
      and possessed of all sorts of talents. Then he must bitterly regret that
      we are not the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost remember when he took us to see our cousin, Mdlle. Adrienne,
      who was so affectionate and kind to us, that he said to us, with
      admiration: &lsquo;Did you notice her, my children? How beautiful she is,
      and what talent, what a noble heart, and therewith such grace and
      elegance!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is very true! Mdlle. de Cardoville is so beautiful, her
      voice is so sweet and gentle, that, when we saw and heard her, we fancied
      that all our troubles were at an end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is because of such beauty, no doubt, that our father,
      comparing us with our cousin and so many other handsome young ladies,
      cannot be very proud of us. And he, who is so loved and honored, would
      have liked to have been proud of his daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Rose laid her hand on her sister&rsquo;s arm, and said to her,
      with anxiety: &ldquo;Listen! listen! they are talking very loud in father&rsquo;s
      bedroom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Blanche, listening in her turn; &ldquo;and I can
      hear him walking. That is his step.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven! how he raises his voice; he seems to be in a great
      passion; he will perhaps come this way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the thought of their father&rsquo;s coming&mdash;that father who
      really adored them&mdash;the unhappy children looked in terror at each
      other. The sound of a loud and angry voice became more and more distinct;
      and Rose, trembling through all her frame, said to her sister: &ldquo;Do
      not let us remain here! Come into our room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should hear, without designing it, the words of our father&mdash;and
      he does not perhaps know that we are so near.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Come, come!&rdquo; answered Blanche, as she rose
      hastily from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am afraid. I have never heard him speak in so angry a tone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! kind heaven!&rdquo; said Blanche, growing pale, as she stopped
      involuntarily. &ldquo;It is to Dagobert that he is talking so loud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the matter&mdash;to make our father speak to him in
      that way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! some great misfortune must have happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sister! do not let us remain here! It pains me too much to hear
      Dagobert thus spoken to.&rdquo;

      the next room, so frightened the orphans, that, pale and trembling with
      emotion, they rushed into their own apartment, and fastened the door. We
      must now explain the cause of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s violent anger.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. THE STUNG LION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his was the scene,
      the sound of which had so terrified Rose and Blanche. At first alone in
      his chamber, in a state of exasperation difficult to describe, Marshal
      Simon had begun to walk hastily up and down, his handsome, manly face
      inflamed with rage, his eyes sparkling with indignation, while on his
      broad forehead, crowned with short-cut hair that was now turning gray,
      large veins, of which you might count the pulsations, were swollen almost
      to bursting; and sometimes his thick, black moustache was curled with a
      convulsive motion, not unlike that which is seen in the visage of a raging
      lion. And even as the wounded lion, in its fury, harassed and tortured by
      a thousand invisible darts, walks up and down its den with savage wrath,
      so Marshal Simon paced the floor of his room, as if bounding from side to
      side; sometimes he stooped, as though bending beneath the weight of his
      anger; sometimes, on the contrary, he paused abruptly, drew himself up to
      his full height, crossed his arms upon his vigorous chest, and with raised
      brow, threatening and terrible look, seemed to defy some invisible enemy,
      and murmur confused exclamations. Then he stood like a man of war and
      battle in all his intrepid fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he stamped angrily with his foot, approached the chimney-piece,
      and pulled the bell so violently that the bell-rope remained in his hand.
      A servant hastened to attend to this precipitate summons. &ldquo;Did you
      not tell Dagobert that I wished to speak to him?&rdquo; cried the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I executed your grace&rsquo;s orders, but M. Dagobert was
      accompanying his son to the door, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; interrupted Marshal Simon, with an abrupt and
      imperious gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant went out, and his master continued to walk up and down with
      impatient steps, crumpling, in his rage, a letter that he held in his left
      hand. This letter had been innocently delivered by Spoil-sport, who,
      seeing him come in, had run joyously to meet him. At length the door
      opened, and Dagobert appeared. &ldquo;I have been waiting for you a long
      time, sirrah!&rdquo; cried the marshal, in an irritated tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert, more pained than surprised at this burst of anger, which he
      rightly attributed to the constant state of excitement in which the
      marshal had now been for some time past, answered mildly: &ldquo;I beg
      your pardon, general, but I was letting out my son&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that, sir!&rdquo; said the marshal abruptly, giving him the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Dagobert was reading it, the marshal resumed, with growing anger, as
      he kicked over a chair that stood in his way: &ldquo;Thus, even in my own
      house, there are wretches bribed to harass me with incredible
      perseverance. Well! have you read it, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fresh insult to add to the others,&rdquo; said Dagobert,
      coolly, as he threw the letter into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter is infamous&mdash;but it speaks the truth,&rdquo;
      replied the marshal. Dagobert looked at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you tell who brought me this infamous letter&rdquo;
      continued the marshal. &ldquo;One would think the devil had a hand in it&mdash;for
      it was your dog!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoil-sport?&rdquo; said Dagobert, in the utmost surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the marshal, bitterly; &ldquo;it is no doubt a
      joke of your invention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no heart for joking, general,&rdquo; answered Dagobert, more
      and more saddened by the irritable state of the marshal; &ldquo;I cannot
      explain how it happened. Spoil-sport is a good carrier, and no doubt found
      the letter in the house&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who can have left it there? Am I surrounded by traitors? Do you
      keep no watch? You, in whom I have every confidence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, general&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the marshal proceeded, without waiting to hear him. &ldquo;What! I
      have made war for five-and-twenty years, I have battled with armies, I
      have struggled victoriously through the evil times of exile and
      proscription, I have withstood blows from maces of iron&mdash;and now I am
      to be killed with pins! Pursued into my own house, harassed with impunity,
      worn out, tortured every minute, to gratify some unknown, miserable hate!&mdash;When
      I say unknown, I am wrong&mdash;it is d&rsquo;Aigrigny, the renegade, who
      is at the bottom of all this, I am sure. I have in the world but one
      enemy, and he is the man. I must finish with him, for I am weary of this&mdash;it
      is too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, general, remember he is a priest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care for that? Have I not seen him handle the sword? I
      will yet make a soldier&rsquo;s blood rise to the forehead of the traitor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, general&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, that I must be avenged on some one,&rdquo; cried the
      marshal, with an accent of the most violent exasperation; &ldquo;I tell
      you, that I mast find a living representative of these cowardly plots,
      that I may at once make an end of him!&mdash;They press upon me from all
      sides; they make my life a hell&mdash;you know it&mdash;and you do nothing
      to save me from these tortures, which are killing me as by a slow fire.
      Can I have no one in whom to trust?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, I can&rsquo;t let you say that,&rdquo; replied Dagobert,
      in a calm, but firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, I can&rsquo;t let you say that you have no one to trust
      to. You might end perhaps in believing it, and then it would be even worse
      for yourself, than for those who well know their devotion for you, and
      would go through fire and water to serve you. I am one of them&mdash;and
      you know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These simple words, pronounced by Dagobert with a tone of deep conviction,
      recalled the marshal to himself; for although his honorable and generous
      character might from time to time be embittered by irritation and grief,
      he soon recovered his natural equanimity. So, addressing Dagobert in a
      less abrupt tone, he said to him, though still much agitated: &ldquo;You
      are right. I could never doubt your fidelity. But anger deprives me of my
      senses. This infamous letter is enough to drive one mad. I am unjust,
      ungrateful&mdash;yes, ungrateful&mdash;and to you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think of me, general. With a kind word at the end, you might
      blow me up all the year round. But what has happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The general&rsquo;s countenance again darkened, as he answered rapidly:
      &ldquo;I am looked down upon, and despised!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I. After all,&rdquo; resumed the marshal bitterly, &ldquo;why
      should I conceal from you this new wound? If I doubted you a moment, I owe
      you some compensation, and you shall know all. For some time past, I
      perceived that, when I meet any of my old companions in arms, they try to
      avoid me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! was it to this that the anonymous letter alluded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and it spoke the truth,&rdquo; replied the marshal, with a
      sigh of grief and indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is impossible, general&mdash;you are so loved and respected&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are mere words; I speak of positive facts. When I appear, the
      conversation is often interrupted. Instead of treating me as an old
      comrade, they affect towards me a rigorously cold politeness. There are a
      thousand little shades, a thousand trifles, which wound the heart, but
      which it is impossible to notice&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you are now saying, general, quite confounds me,&rdquo;
      replied Dagobert. &ldquo;You assure me of it, and I am forced to believe
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is intolerable! I was resolved to ease my heart of it; so,
      this morning, I went to General d&rsquo;Havrincourt, who was colonel with
      me in the Imperial Guard; he is honor and honesty itself. I went to him
      with open heart. &lsquo;I perceive,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the coldness
      that is shown me. Some calumny must be circulating to my disadvantage.
      Tell me all about it. Knowing the attack, I shall be able to defend myself&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, general?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Havrincourt remained impassible ceremoniously polite. To
      all my questions he answered coldly: &lsquo;I am not aware, my lord duke,
      that any calumny has been circulated with regard to you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do
      not call me &ldquo;my lord duke,&rdquo; my dear D&rsquo;Havrincourt; we
      are old fellow-soldiers and friends, my honor is somewhat touchy, I
      confess, and I find that you and our comrades do not receive me so
      cordially, as in times past. You do not deny it; I see, I know, I feel it.&rsquo;
      To all this D&rsquo;Havrincourt answered, with the same coldness: &lsquo;I
      have never seen any one wanting in respect towards you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
      am not talking of respect,&rsquo; exclaimed I, as I clasped his hand
      affectionately, though I observed that he but feebly returned the
      pressure; &lsquo;I speak of cordiality, confidence, which I once enjoyed,
      while now I am treated like a stranger. Why is it? What has occasioned
      this change?&rsquo;&mdash;Still cold and reserved, he answered: &lsquo;These
      distinctions are so nice, marshal, that it is impossible for me to give
      you any opinion on the subject.&rsquo;&mdash;My heart swelled with grief
      and anger. What was I to do? To quarrel with D&rsquo;Havrincourt would
      have been absurd. A sense of dignity forced me to break off the interview,
      but it has only confirmed my fears. Thus,&rdquo; added the marshal,
      getting more and more animated, &ldquo;thus am I fallen from the esteem to
      which I am entitled, thus am I despised, without even knowing the cause!
      Is it not odious? If they would only utter a charge against me&mdash;I
      should at least be able to defend myself, and to find an answer. But no,
      no! not even a word&mdash;only the cold politeness that is worse than any
      insult. Oh! it is too much, too much! for all this comes but in addition
      to other cares. What a life is mine since the death of my father! If I did
      but find rest and happiness at home&mdash;but no! I come in, but to read
      shameful letters; and still worse,&rdquo; added the marshal, in a
      heartrending tone, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;to find
      my children grow more and more indifferent towards me&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
      continued he, perceiving the amazement of Dagobert, &ldquo;and yet they
      know how much I love them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughters indifferent!&rdquo; exclaimed Dagobert, in
      astonishment. &ldquo;You make them such a reproach?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I do not blame them. They have hardly had time to know me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not had time to know you?&rdquo; returned the soldier, in a tone of
      remonstrance, and warming up in his turn. &ldquo;Ah! of what did their
      mother talk to them, except you? and I too! what could I teach your
      children except to know and love you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take their part&mdash;that is natural&mdash;they love you
      better than they do me,&rdquo; said the marshal, with growing bitterness.
      Dagobert felt himself so painfully affected, that he looked at the marshal
      without answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; continued the other; &ldquo;yes! it may be base and
      ungrateful&mdash;but no matter!&mdash;Twenty times I have felt jealous of
      the affectionate confidence which my children display towards you, while
      with me they seem always to be in fear. If their melancholy faces ever
      grow animated for a moment, it is in talking to you, in seeing you; while
      for me they have nothing but cold respect&mdash;and that kills me. Sure of
      the affection of my children, I would have braved and surmounted every
      difficulty&mdash;&rdquo; Then, seeing that Dagobert rushed towards the
      door which led to the chamber of Rose and Blanche, the marshal asked:
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your daughters, general.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bring them face to face with you&mdash;to tell them: &lsquo;My
      children, your father thinks that you do not love him.&rsquo;&mdash;I will
      only say that&mdash;and then you will see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert! I forbid you to do it,&rdquo; cried the marshal, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that&mdash;you have no right to be unjust to
      the poor children,&rdquo; said the soldier, as he again advanced towards
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert, I command you to remain here,&rdquo; cried the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, general. I am your soldier, your inferior, your
      servant, if you will,&rdquo; said the old grenadier, roughly; &ldquo;but
      neither rank nor station shall keep me silent, when I have to defend your
      daughters. All must be explained&mdash;I know but one way&mdash;and that
      is to bring honest people face to face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the marshal had not seized him by the arm, Dagobert would have entered
      the apartment of the young girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain!&rdquo; said the marshal, so imperiously that the soldier,
      accustomed to obedience, hung his head, and stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; resumed the marshal. &ldquo;Tell my
      children, that I think they do not love me? induce them to affect a
      tenderness they do not feel&mdash;when it is not their fault, but mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, general!&rdquo; said Dagobert, in a tone of despair, &ldquo;I
      no longer feel anger, in hearing you speak thus of your children. It is
      such grief, that it breaks my heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched by the expression of the soldier&rsquo;s countenance, the marshal
      continued, less abruptly: &ldquo;Come, I may be wrong; and yet I ask you,
      without bitterness or jealousy, are not my children more confiding, more
      familiar, with you than with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me, general!&rdquo; cried Dagobert; &ldquo;if you come to
      that, they are more familiar with Spoil-sport than with either of us. You
      are their father; and, however kind a father may be, he must always
      command some respect. Familiar with me! I should think so. A fine story!
      What the devil should they respect in me, who, except that I am six feet
      high, and wear a moustache, might pass for the old woman that nursed them?&mdash;and
      then I must say, that, even before the death of your worthy father, you
      were sad and full of thought; the children have remarked that; and what
      you take for coldness on their part, is, I am sure, anxiety for you. Come,
      general; you are not just. You complain, because they love you too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I complain, because I suffer,&rdquo; said the marshal, in an agony
      of excitement. &ldquo;I alone know my sufferings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must indeed be grievous, general,&rdquo; said Dagobert,
      carried further than he would otherwise have gone by his attachment for
      the orphans, &ldquo;since those who love you feel them so cruelly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir! more reproaches?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, general, reproaches,&rdquo; cried Dagobert. &ldquo;Your
      children have the right to complain of you, since you accuse them so
      unjustly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the marshal, scarcely able to contain himself,
      &ldquo;this is enough&mdash;this is too much!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! it is enough,&rdquo; replied Dagobert, with rising
      emotion. &ldquo;Why defend unfortunate children, who can only love and
      submit? Why defend them against your unhappy blindness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal started with anger and impatience, but then replied, with a
      forced calmness: &ldquo;I needs must remember all that I owe you&mdash;and
      I will not forget it, say what you will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, general,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, &ldquo;why will you not let me
      fetch your children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see that this scene is killing me?&rdquo; cried the
      exasperated marshal. &ldquo;Do you not understand, that I will not have my
      children witness what I suffer? A father&rsquo;s grief has its dignity,
      sir; and you ought to feel for and respect it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respect it? no&mdash;not when it is founded on injustice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, sir&mdash;enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not content with tormenting yourself,&rdquo; cried Dagobert,
      unable any longer to control his feelings, &ldquo;do you know what you
      will do? You will make your children die of sorrow. Was it for this, that
      I brought them to you from the depths of Siberia?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More reproaches!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for the worst ingratitude towards me, is to make your children
      unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room, sir!&rdquo; cried the marshal, quite beside
      himself, and so terrible with rage and grief, that Dagobert, regretting
      that he had gone so far, resumed: &ldquo;I was wrong, general. I have
      perhaps been wanting in respect to you&mdash;forgive me&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you&mdash;only leave me!&rdquo; said the marshal, hardly
      restraining himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word, general&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I entreat you to leave me&mdash;I ask it as a service&mdash;is that
      enough?&rdquo; said the marshal, with renewed efforts to control the
      violence of his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deadly paleness succeeded to the high color which during this painful
      scene had inflamed the cheeks of the marshal. Alarmed at this symptom,
      Dagobert redoubled his entreaties. &ldquo;I implore you, general,&rdquo;
      said he, in an agitated mice, &ldquo;to permit me for one moment&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you will have it so, sir, I must be the one to leave,&rdquo;
      said the marshal, making a step towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were said in such a manner, that Dagobert could no longer
      resist. He hung his head in despair, looked for a moment in silent
      supplication at the marshal, and then, as the latter seemed yielding to a
      new movement of rage, the soldier slowly quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes had scarcely elapsed since the departure of Dagobert, when
      the marshal, who, after a long and gloomy silence, had repeatedly drawn
      near the door of his daughters&rsquo; apartment with a mixture of
      hesitation and anguish, suddenly made a violent effort, wiped the cold
      sweat from his brow, and entered the chamber in which Rose and Blanche had
      taken refuge.

      CHAPTER XLIX. THE TEST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>agobert was right
      in defending his children, as he paternally called Rose and Blanche, and
      yet the apprehensions of the marshal with regard to the coldness of his
      daughters, were unfortunately justified by appearances. As he had told his
      father, unable to explain the sad, and almost trembling embarrassment,
      which his daughters felt in his presence, he sought in vain for the cause
      of what he termed their indifference. Now reproaching himself bitterly for
      not concealing from them his grief at the death of their mother, he feared
      he might have given them to understand that they would be unable to
      console him; now supposing that he had not shown himself sufficiently
      tender, and that had chilled them with his military sternness; and now
      repeating with bitter regret, that, having always lived away from them, he
      must be always a stranger to them. In a word, the most unlikely
      suppositions presented themselves by turns to his mind, and whenever such
      seeds of doubt, suspicion, or fear, are blended with a warm affection,
      they will sooner or later develop themselves with fatal effect. Yet,
      notwithstanding this fancied coldness, from which he suffered so much, the
      affection of the marshal for his daughters was so true and deep, that the
      thought of again quitting them caused the hesitations which were the
      torment of his life, and provoked an incessant struggle between his
      paternal love and the duty he held most sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The injurious calumnies, which had been so skillfully propagated, that men
      of honor, like his old brothers in arms, were found to attach some credit
      to them, had been spread with frightful pertinacity by the friends of the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier. We shall describe hereafter the meaning and
      object of these odious reports, which, joined with so many other fatal
      injuries, had filled up the measure of the marshal&rsquo;s indignation.
      Inflamed with anger, excited almost to madness by this incessant &ldquo;stabbing
      with pins&rdquo; (as he had himself called it), and offended at some of
      Dagobert&rsquo;s words, he had spoken harshly to him. But, after the
      soldier&rsquo;s departure, when left to reflect in silence, the marshal
      remembered the warm and earnest expressions of the defender of his
      children, and doubt crossed his mind, as to the reality of the coldness of
      which he accused them. Therefore, having taken a terrible resolution in
      case a new trial should confirm his desponding doubts, he entered, as we
      before said, his, daughters&rsquo; chamber. The discussion with Dagobert
      had been so loud, that the sound of the voices had confusedly reached the
      ears of the two sisters, even after they had taken refuge in their
      bedroom. So that, on the arrival of their father, their pale faces
      betrayed their fear and anxiety. At sight of the marshal, whose
      countenance was also much agitated, the girls rose respectfully, but
      remained close together, trembling in each other&rsquo;s arms. And yet
      there was neither anger nor severity on their father&rsquo;s face&mdash;only
      a deep, almost supplicating grief, which seemed to say: &ldquo;My
      children, I suffer&mdash;I have come to you&mdash;console me, love me! or
      I shall die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal&rsquo;s countenance was at this moment so expressive, that,
      the first impulse of fear once surmounted, the sisters were about to throw
      themselves into his arms; but remembering the recommendations of the
      anonymous letter, which told them how painful any effusion of their
      tenderness was to their father, they exchanged a rapid glance, and
      remained motionless. By a cruel fatality, the marshal at this moment
      burned to open his arms to his children. He looked at them with love, he
      even made a slight movement as if to call them to him; but he would not
      attempt more, for fear of meeting with no response. Still the poor
      children, paralyzed by perfidious counsels, remained mute, motionless,
      trembling!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all over,&rdquo; thought he, as he gazed upon them. &ldquo;No
      chord of sympathy stirs in their bosom. Whether I go&mdash;-whether I
      remain&mdash;matters not to them. No, I am nothing to these children&mdash;since,
      at this awful moment, when they see me perhaps for the last time, no
      filial instinct tells them that their affection might save me still!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During these terrible reflections, the marshal had not taken his eyes off
      his children, and his manly countenance assumed an expression at once so
      touching and mournful&mdash;his look revealed so painfully the tortures of
      his despairing soul&mdash;that Rose and Blanche, confused, alarmed, but
      yielding together to a spontaneous movement, threw themselves on their
      father&rsquo;s neck, and covered him with tears and caresses. Marshal
      Simon had not spoken a word; his daughters had not uttered a sound; and
      yet all three had at length understood one another. A sympathetic shock
      had electrified and mingled those three hearts. Vain fears, false doubts,
      lying counsel, all had yielded to the irresistible emotion which had
      brought the daughters to their father&rsquo;s arms. A sudden revelation
      gave them faith, at the fatal moment when incurable suspicion was about to
      separate them forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second, the marshal felt all this, but words failed him. Pale,
      bewildered, kissing the brows, the hair, the hands of his daughters,
      weeping, sighing, smiling all in turn, he was wild, delirious, drunk with
      happiness. At length, he exclaimed: &ldquo;I have found them&mdash;or
      rather, I have never lost them. They loved me, and did not dare to tell me
      so. I overawed them. And I thought it was my fault. Heavens! what good
      that does! what strength, what heart, what hope!&mdash;Ha! ha!&rdquo;
      cried he, laughing and weeping at the same time, whilst he covered his
      children with caresses; &ldquo;they may despise me now, they may harass me
      now&mdash;I defy them all. My own blue eyes! my sweet blue eyes! look at
      me well, and inspire me with new life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! you love us then as much as we love you?&rdquo; cried
      Rose, with enchanting simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we may often, very often, perhaps every day, throw ourselves on
      your neck, embrace you, and prove how glad we are to be with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show you, dear father, all the store of love we were heaping up in
      our hearts&mdash;so sad, alas! that we could not spend it upon you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you aloud all that we think in secret?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you may do so&mdash;you may do so,&rdquo; said Marshal
      Simon, faltering with joy; &ldquo;what prevented you, my children? But no;
      do not answer; enough of the past!&mdash;I know all, I understand all. You
      misinterpreted my gloom, and it made you sad; I, in my turn,
      misinterpreted your sadness. But never mind; I scarcely know what I am
      saying to you. I only think of looking at you&mdash;and it dazzles me&mdash;it
      confuses me&mdash;it is the dizziness of joy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look at us, father! look into our eyes, into our hearts,&rdquo;
      cried Rose, with rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will read there, happiness for us, and love for you, sir!&rdquo;
      added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir!&rdquo; said the marshal, in a tone of affectionate
      reproach; &ldquo;what does that mean? Will you call me father, if you
      please?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, your hand!&rdquo; said Blanche, as she took it, and
      placed it on her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, your hand!&rdquo; said Rose, as she took the other
      hand of the marshal. &ldquo;Do you believe now in our love and happiness?&rdquo;
      she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the charming expression of filial pride in
      the divine faces of the girls, as their father, slightly pressing their
      virgin bosoms, seemed to count with delight the joyous pulsations of their
      hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! happiness and affection can alone make the heart beat
      thus!&rdquo; cried the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse sob, heard in the direction of the open door, made the three turn
      round, and there they saw the tall figure of Dagobert, with the black nose
      of Spoil-sport reaching to his master&rsquo;s knee. The soldier, drying
      his eyes and moustache with his little blue cotton handkerchief, remained
      motionless as the god Terminus. When he could speak, he addressed himself
      to the marshal, and, shaking his head, muttered, in a hoarse voice, for
      the good man was swallowing his tears: &ldquo;Did I not tell you so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said the marshal, with a sign of intelligence.
      &ldquo;You were a better father than myself, my old friend. Come and kiss
      them! I shall not be jealous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal stretched out his hand to the soldier, who pressed it
      cordially, whilst the two sisters threw themselves on his neck, and
      Spoil-sport, according to custom wishing to have his share in the general
      joy, raised himself on his hind legs, and rested his fore-paws against his
      master&rsquo;s back. There was a moment of profound silence. The celestial
      felicity enjoyed during that moment, by the marshal, his daughters, and
      the soldier, was interrupted by the barking of Spoil-sort, who suddenly
      quitted the attitude of a biped. The happy group separated, looked round,
      and saw Loony&rsquo;s stupid face. He looked even duller than usual, as he
      stood quite still in the doorway, staring with wide stretched eyes, and
      holding a feather-broom under his arm, and in his hand the ever-present
      basket of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing makes one so gay as happiness; and, though this grotesque figure
      appeared at a very unseasonable moment, it was received with frank
      laughter from the blooming lips of Rose and Blanche. Having made the
      marshal&rsquo;s daughters laugh, after their long sadness, Loony at once
      acquired a claim to the indulgence of the marshal, who said to him, good
      humoredly: &ldquo;What do you want, my lad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me, my lord duke!&rdquo; answered Loony, laying his
      hand on his breast, as if it were taking a vow, so that his feather-brush
      fell down from under his arm. The laughter of the girls redoubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not you?&rdquo; said the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Spoil-sport!&rdquo; Dagobert called, for the honest dog
      seemed to have a secret dislike for the pretended idiot, and approached
      him with an angry air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord duke, it is not me!&rdquo; resumed Loony. &ldquo;It is
      the footman who told me to tell M. Dagobert, when I brought up the wood to
      tell my lord duke, as I was coming up with the basket, that M. Robert
      wants to see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls laughed still more at this new stupidity. But, at the name of
      Robert, Marshal Simon started.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Robert was the secret emissary of Rodin, with regard to the possible,
      but adventurous, enterprise of attempting the liberation of Napoleon II.
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, the marshal, whose face was still radiant
      with joy and happiness, said to Loony: &ldquo;Beg M. Robert to wait for me
      a moment in my study.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord duke,&rdquo; answered Loony, bowing almost to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simpleton withdrew, and the marshal said to his daughters, in a joyous
      tone, &ldquo;You see, that, in a moment like this, one does not leave one&rsquo;s
      children, even for M. Robert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s right, father!&rdquo; cried Blanche, gayly;
      &ldquo;for I was already very angry with this M. Robert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you pen and paper at hand?&rdquo; asked the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; there on the table,&rdquo; said Rose, hastily, as she
      pointed to a little desk near one of the windows, towards which the
      marshal now advanced rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From motives of delicacy, the girls remained where they were, close to the
      fireplace, and caressed each other tenderly, as if to congratulate
      themselves in private on the unexpected happiness of this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal seated himself at the desk, and made a sign to Dagobert to
      draw near.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he wrote rapidly a few words in a firm hand, he said to the soldier
      with a smile, in so low a tone that it was impossible for his daughters to
      hear: &ldquo;Do you know what I had almost resolved upon, before entering
      this room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, general?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To blow my brains out. It is to my children that I owe my life.&rdquo;
      And the marshal continued writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert started at this communication, and then replied, also in a
      whisper: &ldquo;It would not have been with your pistols. I took off the
      caps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal turned round hastily, and looked at him with an air of
      surprise. But the soldier only nodded his head affirmatively, and added:
      &ldquo;Thank heaven, we have now done with all those ideas!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal&rsquo;s only answer was to glance at his children, his eyes
      swimming with tenderness, and sparkling with delight; then, sealing the
      note he had written, he gave it to the soldier, and said to him, &ldquo;Give
      that to M. Robert. I will see him to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert took the letter, and went out. Returning towards his daughters,
      the marshal joyfully extended his arms to them, and said, &ldquo;Now,
      young ladies, two nice kisses for having sacrificed M. Robert to you. Have
      I not earned them?&rdquo; And Rose and Blanche threw themselves on their
      father&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the time that these events were taking place at Paris, two
      travellers, wide apart from each other, exchanged mysterious thoughts
      through the breadth of space.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he sun is fast
      sinking. In the depths of an immense piny wood, in the midst of profound
      solitude, rise the ruins of an abbey, once sacred to St. John the Baptist.
      Ivy, moss, and creeping plants, almost entirely conceal the stones, now
      black with age. Some broken arches, some walls pierced with ovals, still
      remain standing, visible on the dark background of the thick wood. Looking
      down upon this mass of ruins from a broken pedestal, half-covered with
      ivy, a mutilated, but colossal statue of stone still keeps its place. This
      statue is strange and awful. It represents a headless human figure. Clad
      in the antique toga, it holds in its hand a dish and on that dish is a
      head. This head is its own. It is the statue of St. John the Baptist and
      Martyr, put to death by wish of Herodias.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence around is solemn. From time to time, however, is heard the
      dull rustling of the enormous branches of the pine-trees, shaken by the
      wind. Copper-colored clouds, reddened by the setting sun, pass slowly over
      the forest, and are reflected in the current of a brook, which, deriving
      its source from a neighboring mass of rocks, flows through the ruins. The
      water flows, the clouds pass on, the ancient trees tremble, the breeze
      murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, through the shadow thrown by the overhanging wood, which
      stretches far into endless depths, a human form appears. It is a woman.
      She advances slowly towards the ruins. She has reached them. She treads
      the once sacred ground. This woman is pale, her look sad, her long robe
      floats on the wind, her feet covered with dust. She walks with difficulty
      and pain. A block of stone is placed near the stream, almost at the foot
      of the statue of John the Baptist. Upon this stone she sinks breathless
      and exhausted, worn out with fatigue. And yet, for many days, many years,
      many centuries, she has walked on unwearied.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30333m.jpg" alt="30333m&rdquo; width=" /><br />

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30333.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      For the first time, she feels an unconquerable sense of lassitude. For the
      first time, her feet begin to fail her. For the first time, she, who
      traversed, with firm and equal footsteps, the moving lava of torrid
      deserts, while whole caravans were buried in drifts of fiery sand&mdash;who
      passed, with steady and disdainful tread, over the eternal snows of Arctic
      regions, over icy solitudes, in which no other human being could live&mdash;who
      had been spared by the devouring flames of conflagrations, and by the
      impetuous waters of torrents&mdash;she, in brief, who for centuries had
      had nothing in common with humanity&mdash;for the first time suffers
      mortal pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her feet bleed, her limbs ache with fatigue, she is devoured by burning
      thirst. She feels these infirmities, yet scarcely dares to believe them
      real. Her joy would be too immense! But now, her throat becomes dry,
      contracted, all on fire. She sees the stream, and throws herself on her
      knees, to quench her thirst in that crystal current, transparent as a
      mirror. What happens then? Hardly have her fevered lips touched the fresh,
      pure water, than, still kneeling, supported on her hands, she suddenly
      ceases to drink, and gazes eagerly on the limpid stream. Forgetting the
      thirst which devours her, she utters a loud cry&mdash;a cry of deep,
      earnest, religious joy, like a note of praise and infinite gratitude to
      heaven. In that deep mirror, she perceives that she has grown older.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days, a few hours, a few minutes, perhaps in a single second, she
      has attained the maturity of age. She, who for more than eighteen
      centuries has been as a woman of twenty, carrying through successive
      generations the load of her imperishable youth&mdash;she has grown old,
      and may, perhaps, at length, hope to die. Every minute of her life may now
      bring her nearer to the last home! Transported by that ineffable hope, she
      rises, and lifts her eyes to heaven, clasping her hands in an attitude of
      fervent prayer. Then her eyes rest on the tall statue of stone,
      representing St. John. The head, which the martyr carries in his hand,
      seems, from beneath its half-closed granite eyelid, to cast upon the
      Wandering Jewess a glance of commiseration and pity. And it was she,
      Herodias who, in the cruel intoxication of a pagan festival, demanded the
      murder of the saint! And it is at the foot of the martyr&rsquo;s image,
      that, for the first time, the immortality, which weighed on her for so
      many centuries, seems likely to find a term!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, impenetrable mystery! oh, divine hope!&rdquo; she cries.
      &ldquo;The wrath of heaven is at length appeased. The hand of the Lord
      brings me to the feet of the blessed martyr, and I begin once more to feel
      myself a human creature. And yet it was to avenge his death, that the same
      heaven condemned me to eternal wanderings!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord! grant that I may not be the only one forgiven. May he&mdash;the
      artisan, who like me, daughter of a king, wanders on for centuries&mdash;likewise
      hope to reach the end of that immense journey!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, Lord? where is he? Hast thou deprived me of the power
      once bestowed, to see and hear him through the vastness of intervening
      space? Oh, in this mighty moment, restore me that divine gift&mdash;for
      the more I feel these human infirmities, which I hail and bless as the end
      of my eternity of ills, the more my sight loses the power to traverse
      immensity, and my ear to catch the sound of that wanderer&rsquo;s accent,
      from the other extremity of the globe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Night had fallen, dark and stormy. The wind rose in the midst of the great
      pine-trees. Behind their black summits, through masses of dark cloud,
      slowly sailed the silver disk of the moon. The invocation of the Wandering
      Jewess had perhaps been heard. Suddenly, her eyes closed&mdash;with hands
      clasped together, she remained kneeling in the heart of the ruins&mdash;motionless
      as a statue upon a tomb. And then she had a wondrous dream!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. THE CALVARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his was the vision
      of Herodias: On the summit of a high, steep, rocky mountain, there stands
      a cross. The sun is sinking, even as when the Jewess herself, worn out
      with fatigue, entered the ruins of St. John&rsquo;s Abbey. The great
      figure on the cross&mdash;which looks down from this Calvary, on the
      mountain, and on the vast, dreary plain beyond&mdash;stands out white and
      pale against the dark, blue clouds, which stretch across the heavens, and
      assume a violent tint towards the horizon. There, where the setting sun
      has left a long track of lurid light, almost of the hue of blood&mdash;as
      far as the eye can reach, no vegetation appears on the surface of the
      gloomy desert, covered with sand and stones, like the ancient bed of some
      dried-up ocean. A silence as of death broods over this desolate tract.
      Sometimes, gigantic black vultures, with red unfeathered necks, luminous
      yellow eyes, stooping from their lofty flight in the midst of these
      solitudes, come to make their bloody feast on the prey they have carried
      off from less uncultivated regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, did this Calvary, this place of prayer, come to be erected so
      far from the abodes of men? This Calvary was prepared at a great cost by a
      repentant sinner. He had done much harm to his fellow-creatures, and, in
      the hope of obtaining pardon for his crimes, he had climbed this mountain
      on his knees, and become a hermit, and lived there till his death, at the
      foot of this cross, only sheltered by a roof of thatch, now long since
      swept away by the wind. The sun is still sinking. The sky becomes darker.
      The luminous lines on the horizon grow fainter and fainter, like heated
      bars of iron that gradually grow cool. Suddenly, on the eastern side of
      the Calvary, is heard the noise of some falling stones, which, loosened
      from the side of the mountain, roll down rebounding to its base. These
      stones have been loosened by the foot of a traveller, who, after
      traversing the plain below, has, during the last hour, been climbing the
      steep ascent. He is not yet visible&mdash;but one hears the echo of his
      tread&mdash;slow, steady, and firm. At length, he reaches the top of the
      mountain, and his tall figure stands out against the stormy sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller is pale as the great figure on the cross. On his broad
      forehead a black line extends from one temple to the other. It is the
      cobbler of Jerusalem. The poor artisan, who hardened by misery, injustice
      and oppression, without pity for the suffering of the Divine Being who
      bore the cross, repulsed him from his dwelling, and bade him: &ldquo;Go
      ON! GO ON! GO ON!&rdquo; And, from that day, the avenging Deity has in his
      turn said to the artisan of Jerusalem: &ldquo;GO ON! GO ON! GO ON!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he has gone on, without end or rest. Nor did the divine vengeance stop
      there. From time to time death has followed the steps of the wanderer, and
      innumerable graves have been even as mile-stones on his fatal path. And if
      ever he found periods of repose in the midst of his infinite grief, it was
      when the hand of the Lord led him into deep solitudes, like that where he
      now dragged his steps along. In passing over that dreary plain, or
      climbing to that rude Calvary, he at least heard no more the funeral
      knell, which always, always sounded behind him in every inhabited region.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long, even at this hour, plunged in the black abyss of his
      thoughts, following the fatal track&mdash;going whither he was guided by
      the invisible hand, with head bowed on his breast, and eyes fixed upon the
      ground, the wanderer had passed over the plain, and ascended the mountain,
      without once looking at the sky&mdash;without even perceiving the Calvary&mdash;without
      seeing the image upon the cross. He thought of the last descendants of his
      race. He felt, by the sinking of his heart, that great perils continued to
      threaten him. And in the bitterness of a despair, wild and deep as the
      ocean, the cobbler of Jerusalem seated himself at the foot of the cross.
      At this moment a farewell ray of the setting sun, piercing the dark mass
      of clouds, threw a refection upon the Calvary, vivid as a conflagration&rsquo;s
      glare. The Jew rested his forehead upon his hand. His long hair, shaken by
      the evening breeze, fell over his pale face&mdash;when sweeping it back
      from his brow, he started with surprise&mdash;he, who had long ceased to
      wonder at anything. With eager glance he contemplated the long lock of
      hair that he held between his fingers. That hair, until now black as
      night, had become gray. He also, like unto Herodias, was growing older.
    </p>
    <p>
      His progress towards old age, stopped for eighteen hundred years, had
      resumed its course. Like the Wandering Jewess, he might henceforth hope
      for the rest of the grave. Throwing himself on his knees, he stretched his
      hands towards heaven, to ask for the explanation of the mystery which
      filled him with hope. Then, for the first time, his eyes rested on the
      Crucified One, looking down upon the Calvary, even as the Wandering Jewess
      had fixed her gaze on the granite eyelids of the Blessed Martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Saviour, his head bowed under the weight of his crown of thorns,
      seemed from the cross to view with pity, and pardon the artisan, who for
      so many centuries had felt his curse&mdash;and who, kneeling, with his
      body thrown backward in an attitude of fear and supplication, now lifted
      towards the crucifix his imploring hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Messiah!&rdquo; cried the Jew, &ldquo;the avenging arm of
      heaven brings me back to the foot of this heavy cross, which thou didst
      bear, when, stopping at the door of my poor dwelling, thou wert repulsed
      with merciless harshness, and I said unto thee: &lsquo;Go on! go on!&rsquo;&mdash;After
      my long life of wanderings, I am again before this cross, and my hair
      begins to whiten. Oh Lord! in thy divine mercy, hast thou at length
      pardoned me? Have I reached the term of my endless march? Will thy
      celestial clemency grant me at length the repose of the sepulchre, which,
      until now, alas! has ever fled before me?&mdash;Oh! if thy mercy should
      descend upon me, let it fall likewise upon that woman, whose woes are
      equal to mine own! Protect also the last descendants of my race! What will
      be their fate? Already, Lord, one of them&mdash;the only one that
      misfortune had perverted&mdash;has perished from the face of the earth. Is
      it for this that my hair grows gray? Will my crime only be expiated when
      there no longer remains in this world one member of our accursed race? Or
      does this proof of thy powerful goodness, Lord, which restores me to the
      condition of humanity, serve also as a sign of the pardon and happiness of
      my family? Will they at length triumph over the perils which beset them?
      Will they, accomplishing the good which their ancestor designed for his
      fellow creatures, merit forgiveness both for themselves and me? Or will
      they, inexorably condemned as the accursed scions of an accursed stock,
      expiate the original stain of my detested crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tell me&mdash;tell me, gracious Lord! shall I be forgiven with
      them, or will they be punished with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight gave place to a dark and stormy night, yet the Jew continued
      to pray, kneeling at the foot of the cross.

      CHAPTER LII. THE COUNCIL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he following scene
      took place at Saint-Dizier House, two days after the reconciliation of
      Marshal Simon with his daughters. The princess is listening with the most
      profound attention to the words of Rodin. The reverend father, according
      to his habit, stands leaning against the mantelpiece, with his hands
      thrust into the pockets of his old brown great-coat. His thick, dirty
      shoes have left their mark on the ermine hearth-rug. A deep sense of
      satisfaction is impressed on the Jesuit&rsquo;s cadaverous countenance.
      Princess de Saint-Dizier, dressed with that sort of modest elegance which
      becomes a mother of the church, keeps her eyes fixed on Rodin&mdash;for
      the latter has completely supplanted Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny in the good
      graces of this pious lady. The coolness, audacity lofty intelligence, and
      rough and imperious character of the ex-socius have overawed this proud
      woman, and inspired her with a sincere admiration. Even his filthy habits
      and often brutal repartees have their charm for her, and she now prefers
      them to the exquisite politeness and perfumed elegance of the accomplished
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; said Rodin, in a sanctified tone, for these
      people do not take off their masks even with their accomplices, &ldquo;yes,
      madame, we have excellent news from our house at St. Herem. M. Hardy, the
      infidel, the freethinker, has at length entered the pale of the holy Roman
      Catholic and Apostolic Church.&rdquo; Rodin pronounced these last word
      with a nasal twang, and the devout lady bowed her head respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace has at length touched the heart of this impious man,&rdquo;
      continued Rodin, &ldquo;and so effectually that, in his ascetic
      enthusiasm, he has already wished to take the vows which will bind him
      forever to our divine Order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon, father?&rdquo; said the princess, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our statutes are opposed to this precipitation, unless in the case
      of a penitent in articulo mortis&mdash;on the very gasp of death&mdash;should
      such a person consider it necessary for his salvation to die in the habit
      of our Order, and leave us all his wealth for the greater glory of the
      Lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is M. Hardy in so dangerous a condition, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a violent fever. After so many successive calamities, which
      have miraculously brought him into the path of salvation,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, piously, &ldquo;his frail and delicate constitution is almost
      broken up, morally and physically. Austerities, macerations, and the
      divine joys of ecstasy, will probably hasten his passage to eternal life,
      and in a few clays,&rdquo; said the priest, shaking his head with a solemn
      air, &ldquo;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon as that, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is almost certain. I have therefore made use of my
      dispensations, to receive the dear penitent, as in articulo mortis, a
      member of our divine Company, to which, in the usual course, he has made
      over all his possessions, present and to come&mdash;so that now he can
      devote himself entirely to the care of his soul, which will be one victim
      more rescued from the claws of Satan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; cried the lady, in admiration; &ldquo;it is a
      miraculous conversion. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny told me how you had to
      contend against the influence of Abbe Gabriel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbe Gabriel,&rdquo; replied Rodin, &ldquo;has been punished
      for meddling with what did not concern him. I have procured his
      suspension, and he has been deprived of his curacy. I hear that he now
      goes about the cholera hospitals to administer Christian consolation; we
      cannot oppose that&mdash;but this universal comforter is of the true
      heretical stamp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a dangerous character, no doubt,&rdquo; answered the
      princess, &ldquo;for he has considerable influence over other men. It must
      have needed all your admirable and irresistible eloquence to combat the
      detestable counsels of this Abbe Gabriel, who had taken it into his head
      to persuade M. Hardy to return to the life of the world. Really, father,
      you are a second St. Chrysostom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, madame!&rdquo; said Rodin, abruptly, for he was very
      little sensible to flattery; &ldquo;keep that for others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that you&rsquo;re a second St. Chrysostom father,&rdquo;
      repeated the princess with enthusiasm; &ldquo;like him, you deserve the
      name of Golden Mouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff, madame!&rdquo; said Rodin, brutally, shrugging his
      shoulders; &ldquo;my lips are too pale, my teeth too black, for a mouth of
      gold. You must be only joking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madame, you will not catch old birds with chaff,&rdquo; replied
      Rodin, harshly. &ldquo;I hate compliments, and I never pay them.&rdquo;
    </p>

      <a href="images/30341.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your modesty must pardon me, father,&rdquo; said the princess,
      humbly; &ldquo;I could not resist the desire to express to you my
      admiration, for, as you almost predicted, or at least foresaw, two members
      of the Rennepont family, have, within the last few months, resigned all
      claim to the inheritance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked at Madame de Saint-Dizier with a softened and approving air,
      as he heard her thus describe the position of the two defunct claimants.
      For, in Rodin&rsquo;s view of the case, M. Hardy, in consequence of his
      donation and his suicidal asceticism, belonged no longer to this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady continued: &ldquo;One of these men, a wretched artisan, has been
      led to his ruin by the exaggeration of his vices. You have brought the
      other into the path of salvation, by carrying out his loving and tender
      qualities. Honor, then to your foresight, father! for you said that you
      would make use of the passions to attain your end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not boast too soon,&rdquo; said Rodin, impatiently. &ldquo;Have
      you forgotten your niece, and the Hindoo, and the daughters of Marshal
      Simon? Have they also made a Christian end, or resigned their claim to
      share in this inheritance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, doubtless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence, you see, madame, we should not lose time in congratulating
      ourselves on the past, but make ready for the future. The great day
      approaches. The first of June is not far off. Heaven grant we may not see
      the four surviving members of the family continue to live impenitent up to
      that period, and so take possession of this enormous property&mdash;the
      source of perdition in their hands&mdash;but productive of the glory of
      the Church in the hands of our Company!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, you were to see your lawyers on the subject of your
      niece?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen them, father. However uncertain may be the chance of
      which I spoke, it is worth trying. I shall know to-day, I hope, if it is
      legally possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps then,&mdash;in the new condition of life to which she would
      be reduced, we might find means to effect her conversion,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, with a strange and hideous smile; &ldquo;until now, since she has
      been so fatally brought in contact with the Oriental, the happiness of
      these two pagans appears bright and changeless as the diamond. Nothing
      bites into it, not even Faringhea&rsquo;s tooth. Let us hope that the Lord
      will wreak justice on their vain and guilty felicity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation was here interrupted by Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who
      entered the room with an air of triumph, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Victory!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say&rdquo;&rsquo; asked the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone&mdash;last night,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshal Simon,&rdquo; replied the abbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; said Rodin, unable to hide his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no doubt his interview with General d&rsquo;Havrincourt
      which filled up the measure,&rdquo; cried the princess, &ldquo;for I know
      he had a long conversation with the general, who like so many others,
      believed the reports in circulation. All means are good against the
      impious!&rdquo; added the princess, by way of moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any details?&rdquo; asked Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just left Robert,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
      &ldquo;His age and description agree with the marshal&rsquo;s, and the
      latter travels with his papers. Only one thing has greatly surprised your
      emissary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until now, he had always to contend with the hesitations of the
      marshal, and had moreover noticed his gloomy and desponding air.
      Yesterday, on the contrary, he found him so bright with happiness, that he
      could not help asking him the cause of the alteration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Rodin and the princess together, both extremely
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marshal answered: &lsquo;I am indeed the happiest man in the
      world; for I am going joyfully to accomplish a sacred duty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three actors in this scene looked at each other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can have produced this sudden change in the mind of the
      marshal?&rdquo; said the princess, with a pensive air. &ldquo;We rather
      reckon on sorrow and every kind of irritation to urge him to engage in
      this adventurous enterprise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make it out,&rdquo; said Rodin, reflecting; &ldquo;but no
      matter&mdash;he is gone. We must not lose a moment, to commence operations
      on his daughters. Has he taken that infernal soldier with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny; &ldquo;unfortunately, he
      has not done so. Warned by the past, he will redouble his precautions; and
      a man, whom we might have used against him at a pinch, has just been taken
      with the contagion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morok. I could count upon him anywhere and for anything. He is lost
      to us; for, should he recover from the cholera, I fear he will fall a
      victim to a horrible and incurable disease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few days ago, he was bitten by one of the mastiffs of his
      menagerie, and, the next day, the dog showed symptoms of hydrophobia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is dreadful,&rdquo; cried the princess; &ldquo;and where is
      this unfortunate man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been taken to one of the temporary hospitals established in
      Paris, for at present he has only been attacked with cholera. It is doubly
      unfortunate, I repeat, for he was a devoted, determined fellow, ready for
      anything. Now this soldier, who has the care of the orphans, will be very
      difficult to get at, and yet only through him can we hope to reach Marshal
      Simon&rsquo;s daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is clear,&rdquo; said Rodin, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly since the anonymous letters have again awakened his
      suspicions,&rdquo; added Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of the anonymous letters,&rdquo; said Rodin suddenly,
      interrupting Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;there is a fact that you
      ought to know; I will tell you why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides the letters that you know of, Marshal Simon has received a
      number of others unknown to you, in which, by every possible means, it is
      tried to exasperate his irritation against yourself&mdash;for they remind
      him of all the reasons he has to hate you, and mock at him, because your
      sacred character shelters you from his vengeance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny looked at Rodin with amazement, colored in spite
      of himself, and said to him: &ldquo;But for what purpose has your
      reverence acted in this manner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, to clear myself of suspicion with regard to the
      letters; then, to excite the rage of the marshal to madness, by
      incessantly reminding him of the just grounds he has to hate you, and of
      the impossibility of being avenged upon you. This, joined to the other
      emotions of sorrow and anger, which ferment in the savage bosom of this
      man of bloodshed, tended to urge him on to the rash enterprise, which is
      the consequence and the punishment of his idolatry for a miserable
      usurper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, with an air of
      constraint: &ldquo;but I will observe to your reverence, that it was,
      perhaps, rather dangerous thus to excite Marshal Simon against me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Rodin, as he fixed a piercing look upon Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the marshal, excited beyond all bounds, and remembering
      only our mutual hate, might seek me out&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! and what then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! he might forget that I am a priest&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are afraid are you?&rdquo; said Rodin, disdainfully,
      interrupting Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the words: &ldquo;You are afraid,&rdquo; the reverend father almost
      started from his chair; but recovering his coolness, he answered: &ldquo;Your
      reverence is right; yes, I should be afraid under such circumstances; I
      should be afraid of forgetting that I am a priest, and of remembering too
      well that I have been a soldier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Rodin, with sovereign contempt. &ldquo;You are
      still no further than that stupid and savage point of honor? Your cassock
      has not yet extinguished the warlike fire? So that if this brawling
      swordsman, whose poor, weak head, empty and sonorous as a drum, is so
      easily turned with the stupid jargon of &lsquo;Military honor, oaths,
      Napoleon II.&rsquo;&mdash;if this brawling bravo, I say, were to commit
      some violence against you, it would require a great effort, I suppose, for
      you to remain calm?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless, I think,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, quite
      unable to control his agitation, &ldquo;for your reverence to enter upon
      such questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your superior,&rdquo; answered Rodin, severely, &ldquo;I have
      the right to ask. If Marshal Simon had lifted his hand against you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the reverend father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no sirs here&mdash;we are only priests,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, harshly. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny held down his head, scarcely able
      to repress his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you,&rdquo; continued Rodin, obstinately, &ldquo;if Marshal
      Simon had struck you? Is that clear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! in mercy,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, if you like it better, had Marshal Simon left the marks of his
      fingers on your cheek?&rdquo; resumed Rodin, with the utmost pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, pale as death, ground his teeth in a kind of fury
      at the very idea of such an insult, while Rodin, who had no doubt his
      object in asking the question, raised his flabby eyelids, and seemed to
      watch attentively the significant symptoms revealed in the agitated
      countenance of the ex-colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, recovering partly his presence of mind, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny
      replied, in a forcedly calm tone: &ldquo;If I were to be exposed to such
      an insult, I would pray heaven to give me resignation and humility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no doubt heaven would hear your prayers,&rdquo; said Rodin,
      coldly, satisfied with the trial to which he had just put him. &ldquo;Besides,
      you are now warned, and it is not very probable,&rdquo; added he, with a
      grim smile, &ldquo;that Marshal Simon will ever return to test your
      humility. But if he were to return,&rdquo; said Rodin, fixing on the
      reverend father a long and piercing look, &ldquo;you would know how to
      show this brutal swordsman, in spite of all his violence, what resignation
      and humility there is in a Christian soul!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two humble knocks at the door here interrupted the conversation for a
      moment. A footman entered, bearing a large sealed packet on a salver,
      which he presented to the princess. After this, he withdrew. Princess de
      Saint-Dizier, having by a look asked Rodin&rsquo;s permission to open the
      letter, began to read it&mdash;and a cruel satisfaction was soon visible
      on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is hope,&rdquo; cried she addressing herself to Rodin:
      &ldquo;the demand is rigorously legal, and the consequence may be such as
      we desire. In a word, my niece may, any day, be exposed to complete
      destitution. She, who is so extravagant! what a change in her life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall then no doubt have some hold on that untamable character,&rdquo;
      said Rodin with a meditative air; &ldquo;for, till now, all has failed in
      that direction, and one would suppose some kinds of happiness are
      invulnerable,&rdquo; added the Jesuit, gnawing his flat and dirty nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, to obtain the result we desire, we must exasperate my niece&rsquo;s
      pride. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary, that I should see and talk
      to her,&rdquo; said the Princess de Saint-Dizier, reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mdlle. de Cardoville will refuse this interview,&rdquo; said Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied the princess. &ldquo;But she is so happy
      that her audacity must be at its height. Yes, yes&mdash;I know her&mdash;and
      I will write in such a manner, that she will come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; asked Rodin, with a doubtful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fear it, father,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;she will
      come. And her pride once brought into play, we may hope a good deal from
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must then act, lady,&rdquo; resumed Rodin; &ldquo;yes, act
      promptly. The moment approaches. Hate and suspicion are awake. There is
      not a moment to lose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for hate,&rdquo; replied the princess, &ldquo;Mdlle. de
      Cardoville must have seen to what her lawsuit would lead, about what she
      called her illegal detention in a lunatic asylum, and that of the two
      young ladies in St. Mary&rsquo;s Convent. Thank heaven, we have friends
      everywhere! I know from good authority, that the case will break down from
      want of evidence, in spite of the animosity of certain parliamentary
      magistrates, who shall be well remembered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; replied Rodin, &ldquo;the
      departure of the marshal gives us every latitude. We must act immediately
      on his daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must see them,&rdquo; resumed Rodin, &ldquo;talk with them,
      study them. Then we shall act in consequence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the soldier will not leave them a second,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied Rodin, &ldquo;we must talk to them in presence
      of the soldier, and get him on our side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hope is idle,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. &ldquo;You
      do not know the military honor of his character. You do not know this man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know him?&rdquo; said Rodin, shrugging his shoulders.
      &ldquo;Did not Mdlle. de Cardoville present me to him as her liberator,
      when I denounced you as the soul of the conspiracy? Did I not restore to
      him his ridiculous imperial relic&mdash;his cross of honor&mdash;when we
      met at Dr. Baleinier&rsquo;s? Did I not bring him back the girls from the
      convent, and place them in the arms of their father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the princess; &ldquo;but, since that time, my
      abominable niece has either guessed or discovered all. She told you so
      herself, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me, that she considered me her most mortal enemy,&rdquo;
      said Rodin. &ldquo;Be it so. But did she tell the same to the marshal? Has
      she ever mentioned me to him? and if she have done so, has the marshal
      communicated this circumstance to his soldier? It may be so; but it is by
      no means sure; in any case. I must ascertain the fact; if the soldier
      treats me as an enemy, we shall see what is next to be done&mdash;but I
      will first try to be received as a friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; replied Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, my clear father!&rdquo; cried the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier, in alarm; &ldquo;if this soldier were to treat you as an
      enemy&mdash;beware&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always beware, madame. I have had to face worse enemies than he
      is,&rdquo; said the Jesuit showing his black teeth; &ldquo;the cholera to
      begin with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he may refuse to see you, and in what way will you then get at
      Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters?&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not yet know.&rdquo; answered Rodin. &ldquo;But as I intend to
      do it, I shall find the means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the princess, suddenly, on reflection, &ldquo;these
      girls have never seen me, and I might obtain admittance to them, without
      sending in my name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be perfectly useless at present, madame, for I must
      first know what course to take with respect to them. I must see and
      converse with them, at any cost, and then, after I have fixed my plan,
      your assistance may be very useful. In any case, please to be ready to
      morrow, madame, to accompany me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what place, father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Marshal Simon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the marshal&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. You will get into your carriage, and I will take a
      hackney-coach. I will then try to obtain an interview with the girls, and,
      during that time, you will wait for me at a few yards from the house. If I
      succeed, and require your aid, I will come and fetch you; I can give you
      my instructions without any appearance of concert between us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am content, reverend father; but, in truth, I tremble at the
      thought of your interview with that rough trooper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord will watch over his servant, madame!&rdquo; replied Rodin.
      &ldquo;As for you, father,&rdquo; added he, addressing the Abbe d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      &ldquo;despatch instantly to Vienna the note which is all prepared to
      announce the departure and speedy arrival of the marshal. Every precaution
      has been taken. I shall write more fully this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, about eight o&rsquo;clock, the Princess de Saint-Dizier,
      in her carriage, and Rodin, in his hackney-coach, took the direction of
      Marshal Simon&rsquo;s house.

      CHAPTER LIII. HAPPINESS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>arshal Simon has
      been absent two days. It is eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Dagobert,
      walking on tip-toe with the greatest caution, so as not to make the floor
      creak beneath his tread, crosses the room which leads to the bedchamber of
      Rose and Blanche and applies his ear to the door of the apartment. With
      equal caution, Spoil-sport follows exactly the movements of his master.
      The countenance of the soldier is uneasy and full of thought. As he
      approaches the door, he says to himself: &ldquo;I hope the dear children
      heard nothing of what happened in the night! It would alarm them, and it
      is much better that they should not know it at present. It might afflict
      them sadly, poor dears! and they are so gay, so happy, since they feel
      sure of their father&rsquo;s love for them. They bore his departure so
      bravely! I would not for the world that they should know of this
      unfortunate event.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as he listened, the soldier resumed: &ldquo;I hear nothing&mdash;and
      yet they are always awake so early. Can it be sorrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert&rsquo;s reflections were here interrupted by two frank, hearty
      bursts of laughter, from the interior of the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! they are not so sad as I thought,&rdquo; said the soldier,
      breathing more freely. &ldquo;Probably they know nothing about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, the laughter was again heard with redoubled force, and the soldier,
      delighted at this gayety, so rare on the part of &ldquo;his children,&rdquo;
      was much affected by it: the tears started to his eyes at the thought that
      the orphans had at length recovered the serenity natural to their age;
      then, passing from one emotion to the other, still listening at the door,
      with his body leaning forward, and his hands resting on his knees,
      Dagobert&rsquo;s lip quivered with an expression of mute joy, and, shaking
      his head a little, he accompanied with his silent laughter, the increasing
      hilarity of the young girls. At last, as nothing is so contagious as
      gayety, and as the worthy soldier was in an ecstasy of joy, he finished by
      laughing aloud with all his might, without knowing why, and only because
      Rose and Blanche were laughing. Spoil-sport had never seen his master in
      such a transport of delight; he looked at him for a while in deep and
      silent astonishment, and then began to bark in a questioning way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this well-known sound, the laughter within suddenly ceased, and a sweet
      voice, still trembling with joyous emotion, exclaimed: &ldquo;Is it you,
      Spoil-sport, that have come to wake us?&rdquo; The dog understood what was
      said, wagged his tail, held down his ears, and, approaching close to the
      door, answered the appeal of his young mistress by a kind of friendly
      growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoil-sport,&rdquo; said Rose, hardly able to restrain her
      laughter, &ldquo;you are very early this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us what o&rsquo;clock it is, if you please, old fellow?&rdquo;
      added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young ladies, it is past eight,&rdquo; said suddenly the gruff
      voice of Dagobert, accompanying this piece of humor with a loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of gay surprise was heard, and then Rose resumed: &ldquo;Good-morning,
      Dagobert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, my children. You are very lazy to-day, I must tell
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not our fault. Our dear Augustine has not yet been to call
      us. We are waiting for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there it is,&rdquo; said Dagobert to himself, his features once
      more assuming an expression of anxiety. Then he returned aloud, in a tone
      of some embarrassment, for the worthy man was no hand at a falsehood:
      &ldquo;My children, our companion went out this morning&mdash;very early.
      She is gone to the country&mdash;on business&mdash;she will not return for
      some days&mdash;so you had better get up by yourselves for today.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our good Madame Augustine!&rdquo; exclaimed Blanche, with interest.
      &ldquo;I hope it is nothing bad that has made her leave suddenly&mdash;eh,
      Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not at all&mdash;only business,&rdquo; answered the
      soldier. &ldquo;To see one of her relations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so much the better!&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;Well, Dagobert,
      when we call you can come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come back in a quarter of an hour,&rdquo; said the soldier
      as he withdrew; and he thought to himself: &ldquo;I must lecture that fool
      Loony&mdash;for he is so stupid, and so fond of talking, that he will let
      it all out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of the pretended simpleton will serve as a natural transition, to
      inform the reader of the cause of the hilarity of the sisters. They were
      laughing at the numberless absurdities of the idiot. The girls rose and
      dressed themselves, each serving as lady&rsquo;s-maid to the other. Rose
      had combed and arranged Blanche&rsquo;s hair; it was now Blanche&rsquo;s
      turn to do the same for her sister. Thus occupied, they formed a charming
      picture. Rose was seated before the dressing-table; her sister, standing
      behind her, was smoothing her beautiful brown hair. Happy age! so little
      removed from childhood, that present joy instantly obliterates the traces
      of past sorrow! But the sisters felt more than joy; it was happiness, deep
      and unalterable, for their father loved them, and their happiness was a
      delight, and not a pain to him. Assured of the affection of his children,
      he, also, thanks to them, no longer feared any grief. To those three
      beings, thus certain of their mutual love, what was a momentary
      separation? Having explained this, we shall understand the innocent gayety
      of the sisters, notwithstanding their father&rsquo;s departure, and the
      happy, joyous expression, which now filled with animation their charming
      faces, on which the late fading rose had begun once more to bloom. Their
      faith in the future gave to their countenances something resolute and
      decisive, which added a degree of piquancy to the beauty of their
      enchanting features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche, in smoothing her sister&rsquo;s hair, let fall the comb, and, as
      she was stooping to pick it up, Rose anticipated her, saying: &ldquo;If it
      had been broken, we would have put it into the handle-basket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two laughed merrily at this expression, which reminded them of an
      admirable piece of folly on the part of Loony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supposed simpleton had broken the handle of a cup, and when the
      governess of the young ladies had reprimanded him for his carelessness, he
      had answered: &ldquo;Never mind, madame; I have put it into the handle
      basket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The handle-basket, what is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame; it is where I keep all the handles I break off the
      things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Rose, drying her eyes; &ldquo;how silly it is
      to laugh at such foolishness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is droll,&rdquo; replied Blanche; &ldquo;how can we help it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I regret is, that father cannot hear us laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was so happy to see us gay!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must write to him to-day, the story of the handle-basket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that of the feather-brush, to show that, according to promise,
      we kept up our spirits during his absence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to him, sister? no, he is to write to us, and we are not to
      answer his letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! well then, I have an idea. Let us address letters to him
      here, Dagobert can put them into the post, and, on his return, our father
      will read our correspondence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be charming! What nonsense we will write to him, since he
      takes pleasure in it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we, too, like to amuse ourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly! father&rsquo;s last words have given us so much
      courage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I listened to them, I felt quite reconciled to his going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he said to us: &lsquo;My children, I will confide in you all I
      can. I go to fulfill a sacred duty, and I must be absent for some time;
      for though, when I was blind enough to doubt your affection, I could not
      make up my mind to leave you, my conscience was by no means tranquil.
      Grief takes such an effect on us, that I had not the strength to come to a
      decision, and my days were passed in painful hesitation. But now that I am
      certain of your tenderness, all this irresolution has ceased, and I
      understand how one duty is not to be sacrificed to another, and that I
      have to perform two duties at once, both equally sacred; and this I now do
      with joy, and delight, and courage!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, sister!&rdquo; cried Blanche, rising to draw nearer to Rose.
      &ldquo;I think I hear our father when I remember those words, which must
      console and support us during his absence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then our father continued: &lsquo;Instead of grieving at my
      departure, you would rejoice in it, you should be proud and happy. I go to
      perform a good and generous act. Fancy to yourselves, that there is
      somewhere a poor orphan, oppressed and abandoned by all&mdash;and that the
      father of that orphan was once my benefactor, and that I had promised him
      to protect his son&mdash;and that the life of that son is now in peril&mdash;tell
      me, my children; would you regret that I should leave you to fly to the
      aid of such an orphan?&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, brave father!&rsquo; we answered: &lsquo;we should
      not then be your daughters!&rsquo;&rdquo; continued Rose, with enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;Count upon us! We should be indeed unhappy if we thought that our
      sorrow could deprive thee of thy courage. Go! and every day we will say to
      ourselves proudly, &lsquo;It was to perform a great and noble duty that
      our father left us&mdash;we can wait calmly for his return.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How that idea of duty sustains one, sister!&rdquo; resumed Rose,
      with growing enthusiasm. &ldquo;It gave our father the courage to leave us
      without regret, and to us the courage to bear his absence gayly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, how calm we are now! Those mournful dreams, which seemed
      to portend such sad events, no longer afflict us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, sister, this time we are really happy once for all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, do you feel like me? I fancy, that I am stronger and more
      courageous and that I could brave every danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so! We are strong enough now. Our father in the
      midst, you on one side, I on the other&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert in the vanguard, and Spoil-sport in the rear! Then the
      army will be complete, and let &lsquo;em come on by thousands!&rdquo;
      added a gruff, but jovial voice, interrupting the girl, as Dagobert
      appeared at the half open door of the room. It was worth looking at his
      face, radiant with joy; for the old fellow had somewhat indiscreetly been
      listening to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you were listening, Paul Pry!&rdquo; said Rose gayly, as she
      entered the adjoining room with her sister, and both affectionately
      embraced the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, I was listening; and I only regretted not to have ears
      as large as Spoil-sport&rsquo;s! Brave, good girls! that&rsquo;s how I
      like to see you&mdash;bold as brass, and saying to care and sorrow:
      &lsquo;Right about face! march! go to the devil!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will want to make us swear, now,&rdquo; said Rose to her sister,
      laughing with all her might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! now and then, it does no harm,&rdquo; said the soldier;
      &ldquo;it relieves and calms one, when if one could not swear by five
      hundred thousand de&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; said Rose, covering with her pretty
      hand the gray moustache, so as to stop Dagobert in his speech. &ldquo;If
      Madame Augustine heard you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our poor governess! so mild and timid,&rdquo; resumed Blanche.
      &ldquo;How you would frighten her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dagobert, as he tried to conceal his rising
      embarrassment; &ldquo;but she does not hear us. She is gone into the
      country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, worthy woman!&rdquo; replied Blanche, with interest. &ldquo;She
      said something of you, which shows her excellent heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; resumed Rose; &ldquo;for she said to us, in
      speaking of you, &lsquo;Ah, young ladies! my affection must appear very
      little, compared with M. Dagobert&rsquo;s. But I feel that I also have the
      right to devote myself to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, no doubt! she has a heart of gold,&rdquo; answered
      Dagobert. Then he added to himself, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they did it on
      purpose, to bring the conversation back to this poor woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father made a good choice,&rdquo; continued Rose. &ldquo;She is the
      widow of an old officer, who was with him in the wars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we were out of spirits,&rdquo; said Blanche, &ldquo;you should
      have seen her uneasiness and grief, and how earnestly she set about
      consoling us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen the tears in her eyes when she looked at us,&rdquo;
      resumed Rose. &ldquo;Oh! she loves us tenderly, and we return her
      affection. With regard to that, Dagobert, we have a plan as soon as our
      father comes back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, sister!&rdquo; said Blanche, laughing. &ldquo;Dagobert
      will not keep our secret.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you keep it for us, Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; said the soldier, more and more
      embarrassed; &ldquo;you had better not tell it to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! can you keep nothing from Madame Augustine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Dagobert! Dagobert!&rdquo; said Blanche, gayly holding up her
      finger at the soldier; &ldquo;I suspect you very much of paying court to
      our governess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pay court?&rdquo; said the soldier&mdash;and the expression of
      his face was so rueful, as he pronounced these words, that the two sisters
      burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hilarity was at its height when the door opened and Loony advanced
      into room announcing, with a loud voice, &ldquo;M. Rodin!&rdquo; In fact,
      the Jesuit glided almost imperceptibly into the apartment, as if to take
      possession of the ground. Once there, he thought the game his own, and his
      reptile eyes sparkled with joy. It would be difficult to paint the
      surprise of the two sisters, and the anger of the soldier, at this
      unexpected visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rushing upon Loony, Dagobert seized him by the collar, and exclaimed:
      &ldquo;Who gave you leave to introduce any one here without my permission?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, M. Dagobert!&rdquo; said Loony, throwing himself on his
      knees, and clasping his hands with an air of idiotic entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room!&mdash;and you too!&rdquo; added the soldier, with a
      menacing gesture, as he turned towards Rodin, who had already approached
      the girls, with a paternal smile on his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your orders, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the priest, humbly;
      and he made a low bow, but without stirring from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; cried the soldier to Loony, who was still
      kneeling, and who, thanks to the advantages of this position, was able to
      utter a certain number of words before Dagobert could remove him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dagobert,&rdquo; said Loony in a doleful voice, &ldquo;I beg
      pardon for bringing up the gentleman without leave; but, alas, my head is
      turned, because of the misfortune that happened to Madame Augustine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What misfortune?&rdquo; cried Rose and Blanche together, as they
      advanced anxiously towards Loony.
    </p>

      <a href="images/30357.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; thundered Dagobert, shaking the servant by the
      collar, to force him to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak&mdash;speak!&rdquo; said Blanche, interposing between the
      soldier and his prey. &ldquo;What has happened to Madame Augustine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; shouted Loony, in spite of the cuffs of the soldier.
      &ldquo;Madame Augustine was attacked in the night with cholera, and taken&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unable to finish. Dagobert struck him a tremendous blow with his
      fist, right on the jaw, and, putting forth his still formidable strength,
      the old horse-grenadier lifted him to his legs, and with one violent kick
      bestowed on the lower part of his back, sent him rolling into the ante
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to Rodin, with flushed cheek and sparkling eye, Dagobert
      pointed to the door with an expressive gesture, and said in an angry
      voice: &ldquo;Now, be off with you and that quickly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must pay my respects another time, my dear sir,&rdquo; said
      Rodin, as he retired towards the door, bowing to the young girls.

      CHAPTER LIV. DUTY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>odin, retreating
      slowly before the fire of Dagobert&rsquo;s angry looks, walked backwards
      to the door, casting oblique but piercing glances at the orphans, who were
      visibly affected by the servant&rsquo;s intentional indiscretion.
      (Dagobert had ordered him not to speak before the girls of the illness of
      their governess, and that was quite enough to induce the simpleton to take
      the first opportunity of doing so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose hastily approached the soldier, and said to him: &ldquo;Is it true&mdash;is
      it really true that poor Madame Augustine has been attacked with the
      cholera?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I do not know&mdash;I cannot tell,&rdquo; replied the
      soldier, hesitating; &ldquo;besides, what is it to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert, you would conceal from us a calamity,&rdquo; said
      Blanche. &ldquo;I remember now your embarrassment, when we spoke to you of
      our governess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is ill, we ought not to abandon her. She had pity on our
      sorrows; we ought to pity her sufferings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sister; come to her room,&rdquo; said Blanche, advancing
      towards the door, where Rodin had stopped short, and stood listening with
      growing attention to this unexpected scene, which seemed to give him ample
      food for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not leave this room,&rdquo; said the soldier, sternly,
      addressing the two sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert,&rdquo; replied Rose, firmly, &ldquo;it is a sacred duty,
      and it would be cowardice not to fulfil it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that you shall not leave the room,&rdquo; said the
      soldier, stamping his foot with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert,&rdquo; replied Blanche, with as resolute an air as her
      sister&rsquo;s, and with a kind of enthusiasm which brought the blood to
      her fair cheek, &ldquo;our father, when he left us, give us an admirable
      example of devotion and duty. He would not forgive us were we to forget
      the lesson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in a rage, and advancing towards the
      sisters to prevent their quitting the apartment; &ldquo;you think that if
      your governess had the cholera, I would let you go to her under the
      pretext of duty?&mdash;Your duty is to live, to live happy, for your
      father&rsquo;s sake&mdash;and for mine into the bargain&mdash;so not a
      word more of such folly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can run no danger by going to our governess in her room,&rdquo;
      said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there were danger,&rdquo; added Blanche, &ldquo;we ought not
      to hesitate. So, Dagobert, be good! and let us pass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, who had listened to what precedes, with sustained attention,
      suddenly started, as if a thought had struck him; his eye shone brightly,
      and an expression of fatal joy illumined his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dagobert, do not refuse!&rdquo; said Blanche. &ldquo;You would do
      for us what you reproach us with wishing to do for another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dagobert had as it were, till now stood in the path of the Jesuit and the
      twins by keeping close to the door; but, after a moments reflection, he
      shrugged his shoulders, stepped to one side, and said calmly: &ldquo;I was
      an old fool. Come, young ladies; if you find Madame Augustine in the
      house, I will allow you to remain with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised at these words, the girls stood motionless and irresolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If our governess is not here, where is she, then?&rdquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, perhaps, that I am going to tell you in the excitement
      in which you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead!&rdquo; cried Rose growing pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;be calm,&rdquo; said the soldier, hastily; &ldquo;I
      swear to you, by your father&rsquo;s honor, that she is not dead. At the
      first appearance of the disorder, she begged to be removed from the house,
      fearing the contagion for those in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good and courageous woman!&rdquo; said Rose tenderly, &ldquo;And
      you will not allow us&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not allow you to go out, even if I have to lock you up in
      your room,&rdquo; cried the soldier, again stamping with rage; then,
      remembering that the blunderhead&rsquo;s indiscretion was the sole cause
      of this unfortunate incident, he added, with concentrated fury: &ldquo;Oh!
      I will break my stick upon that rascal&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned towards the door, where Rodin still stood, silent and
      attentive, dissembling with habitual impassibility the fatal hopes he had
      just conceived in his brain. The girls, no longer doubting the removal of
      their governess, and convinced that Dagobert would not tell them whither
      they had conveyed her, remained pensive and sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the priest, whom he had forgotten for the moment, the soldier&rsquo;s
      rage increased, and he said to him abruptly: &ldquo;Are you still there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would merely observe to you, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, with
      that air of perfect good nature which he knew so well how to assume,
      &ldquo;that you were standing before the door, which naturally prevented
      me from going out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now nothing prevents you&mdash;so file off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I will file off, if you wish it, my dear sir though I
      think I have some reason to be surprised at such a reception.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no reception at all&mdash;so begone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had come, my dear sir to speak to you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time for talking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon business of great importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no other business of importance than to remain with these
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, pausing on the
      threshold. &ldquo;I will not disturb you any longer; excuse my
      indiscretion. The bearer of excellent news from Marshal Simon, I came&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News from our father!&rdquo; cried Rose, drawing nearer to Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, speak, speak, sir!&rdquo; added Blanche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have news of the marshal!&rdquo; said Dagobert, glancing
      suspiciously at Rodin. &ldquo;Pray, what is this news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rodin, without immediately answering the question, returned from the
      threshold into the room, and, contemplating Rose and Blanche by turns with
      admiration, he resumed: &ldquo;What happiness for me, to be able to bring
      some pleasure to these dear young ladies. They are even as I left them
      graceful, and fair, and charming&mdash;only less sad than on the day when
      I fetched them from the gloomy convent in which they were kept prisoners,
      to restore them to the arms of their glorious father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was their place, and this is not yours,&rdquo; said Dagobert,
      harshly, still holding the door open behind Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess, at least that I was not so much out of place at Dr.
      Baleinier&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, with a cunning air. &ldquo;You
      know, for it was there that I restored to you the noble imperial cross you
      so much regretted&mdash;the day when that good Mdlle. de Cardoville only
      prevented you from strangling me by telling you that I was her liberator.
      Aye! it was just as I have the honor of stating, young ladies,&rdquo;
      added Rodin, with a smile; &ldquo;this brave soldier was very near
      strangling me, for, be it said without offense, he has, in spite of his
      age, a grasp of iron. Ha, ha! the Prussians and Cossacks must know that
      better than I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These few words reminded Dagobert and the twins of the services which
      Rodin had really rendered them; and though the marshal had heard Mdlle. de
      Cardoville speak of Rodin as of a very dangerous man, he had forgotten, in
      the midst of so many anxieties, to communicate this circumstance to
      Dagobert. But this latter, warned by experience, felt, in spite of
      favorable appearances, a secret aversion for the Jesuit; so he replied
      abruptly: &ldquo;The strength of my grasp has nothing to do with the
      matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I allude to that little innocent playfulness on your part, my
      dear sir,&rdquo; said Rodin, in his softest tone, approaching the two
      sisters with a wriggle which was peculiar to him; &ldquo;if I allude to
      it, you see, it was suggested by the involuntary recollection of the
      little services I was happy enough to render you.&rdquo; Dagobert looked
      fixedly at Rodin, who instantly veiled his glance beneath his flabby
      eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; said the soldier, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, &ldquo;a true man never speaks of the services he has rendered,
      and you come back three times to the subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dagobert,&rdquo; whispered Rose, &ldquo;if he brings news of
      our father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier made a sign, as if to beg the girl to let him speak, and
      resumed, looking full at Rodin: &ldquo;You are cunning, but I&rsquo;m no
      raw recruit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cunning?&rdquo; said Rodin, with a sanctified air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very. You think to puzzle me with your fine phrases; but I&rsquo;m
      not to be caught in that way. Just listen to me. Some of your band of
      black-gowns stole my cross; you returned it to me. Some of the same band
      carried off these children; you brought them back. It is also true that
      you denounced the renegade D&rsquo;Aigrigny. But all this only proves two
      things: first, that you were vile enough to be the accomplice of these
      scoundrels; and secondly, that, having been their accomplice, you were
      base enough to betray them. Now, those two facts are equally bad, and I
      suspect you most furiously. So march off at once; your presence is not
      good for these children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have no buts,&rdquo; answered Dagobert, in an angry voice.
      &ldquo;When a man of your look does good, it is only to hide some evil;
      and one must be on guard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand your suspicions,&rdquo; said Rodin coolly, hiding his
      growing disappointment, for he had hoped it would have been easy to coax
      the soldier; &ldquo;but, if you reflect, what interest have I in deceiving
      you? And in what should the deception consist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some interest or other in persisting to remain here, when
      I tell you to go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already had the honor of informing you of the object of my
      visit, my dear sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bring news of Marshal Simon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the case. I am happy enough to have news of the
      marshal. Yes, my dear young ladies,&rdquo; added Rodin, as he again
      approached the two sisters, to recover, as it were, the ground he had
      lost, &ldquo;I have news of your glorious father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come to my room directly, and you can tell it to me,&rdquo;
      replied Dagobert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you would be cruel enough to deprive these dear ladies of the
      pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heaven, sir!&rdquo; cried Dagobert, in a voice of thunder,
      &ldquo;you will make me forget myself. I should be sorry to fling a man of
      your age down the stairs. Will you be gone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Rodin mildly, &ldquo;do not be angry with a
      poor old man. I am really not worth the trouble. I will go with you to
      your room, and tell you what I have to communicate. You will repent not
      having let me speak before these dear young ladies; but that will be your
      punishment, naughty man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rodin again bowed very low, and, concealing his rage and
      vexation, left the room before Dagobert, who made a sign to the two
      sisters, and then followed, closing the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news of our father, Dagobert?&rdquo; said Rose anxiously, when
      the soldier returned, after a quarter of an hours absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that old conjurer knows that the marshal set out in good
      spirits, and he seems acquainted with M. Robert. How could he be informed
      of all this? I cannot tell,&rdquo; added the soldier, with a thoughtful
      air; &ldquo;but it is only another reason to be on one&rsquo;s guard
      against him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what news of our father?&rdquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of that old rascal&rsquo;s friends (I think him a rascal still)
      knows your father, he tells me, and met him five-and-twenty leagues from
      here. Knowing that this man was coming to Paris, the marshal charged him
      to let you know that he was in perfect health, and hoped soon to see you
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what happiness!&rdquo; cried Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you were wrong to suspect the poor old man, Dagobert,&rdquo;
      added Blanche. &ldquo;You treated him so harshly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly so; but I am not sorry for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my reasons; and one of the best is that, when I saw him came
      in, and go sidling and creeping round about us, I felt chilled to the
      marrow of my bones, without knowing why. Had I seen a serpent crawling
      towards you, I should not have been more frightened. I knew, of course,
      that he could not hurt you in my presence; but I tell you, my children, in
      spite of the services he has no doubt rendered us, it was all I could do
      to refrain from throwing him out of the window. Now, this manner of
      proving my gratitude is not natural, and one must be on one&rsquo;s guard
      against people who inspire us with such ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Dagobert, it is your affection for us that makes you so
      suspicious,&rdquo; said Rose, in a coaxing tone; &ldquo;it proves how much
      you love us.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. THE IMPROVISED HOSPITAL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mong a great
      number of temporary hospitals opened at the time of the cholera in every
      quarter of Paris, one had been established on the ground-floor of a large
      house in the Rue du Mont-Blanc. The vacant apartments had been generously
      placed by their proprietor at the disposal of the authorities; and to this
      place were carried a number of persons, who, being suddenly attacked with
      the contagion, were considered in too dangerous a state to be removed to
      the principal hospitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days had elapsed since Rodin&rsquo;s visit to Marshal Simon&rsquo;s
      daughters. Shortly after he had been expelled, the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier had entered to see them, under the cloak of being a
      house-to-house visitor to collect funds for the cholera sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing the moment when Dagobert, deceived by her lady-like demeanor, had
      withdrawn, she counselled the twins that it was their duty to go and see
      their governess, whom she stated to be in the hospital we now describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The persons who had watched
      during the night by the sick people, in the hospital established in the
      Rue du Mont-Blanc, were about to be relieved by other voluntary
      assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said one of those newly arrived, &ldquo;how
      are we getting on? Has there been any decrease last night in the number of
      the sick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, no; but the doctors think the contagion has reached
      its height.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is some hope of seeing it decrease.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have any of the gentlemen, whose places we come to take, been
      attacked by the disease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came eleven strong last night; we are only nine now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is bad. Were these two persons taken off rapidly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the victims, a young man of twenty-five years of age, a
      cavalry officer on furlough, was struck as it were by lightning. In less
      than a quarter of an hour he was dead. Though such facts are frequent, we
      were speechless with horror.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a word of cordial encouragement and hope for every one. He
      had so far succeeded in raising the spirits of the patients, that some of
      them who were less affected by the cholera than by the fear of it, were
      able to quit the hospital nearly well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! So good a young man! Well, he died gloriously; it
      requires as much courage as on the field of battle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had only one rival in zeal and courage, and that is a Young
      priest, with an angelic countenance, whom they call the Abbe Gabriel. He
      is indefatigable; he hardly takes an hour&rsquo;s rest, but runs from one
      to the other, and offers himself to everybody. He forgets nothing. The
      consolation; which he offers come from the depths of his soul, and are not
      mere formalities in the way of his profession. No, no, I saw him weep over
      a poor woman, whose eyes he had closed after a dreadful agony. Oh, if all
      priests were like him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, a good priest is most worthy of respect. But! who is the
      other victim of last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! his death was frightful. Do not speak of it. I have still the
      horrible scene before my eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sudden attack of cholera?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had only been the contagion, I should not so shudder at the
      remembrance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then did he die of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a string of horrors. Three days ago, they brought here a man,
      who was supposed to be only attacked with cholera. You have no doubt heard
      speak of this personage. He is the lion-tamer, that drew all Paris to the
      Porte-Saint-Martin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the man you mean. Called Morok. He performed a kind of play
      with a tame panther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so; I was myself present at a similar scene, which a
      stranger, an Indian, in consequence of a wager, was said at the time,
      jumped upon the stage and killed the panther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this Morok, brought here as a cholera-patient, and indeed
      with all the symptoms of the contagion, soon showed signs of a still more
      frightful malady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this was&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hydrophobia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he become mad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he confessed, that he had been bitten a few days before by one
      of the mastiffs in his menagerie; unfortunately, we only learnt this
      circumstance after the terrible attack, which cost the life of the poor
      fellow we deplore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it happen, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morok was in a room with three other patients. Suddenly seized with
      a sort of furious delirium, he rose, uttering ferocious cries, and rushed
      raving mad into the passage. Our poor friend made an attempt to stop him.
      This kind of resistance increased the frenzy of Morok, who threw himself
      on the man that crossed his path, and, tearing him with his teeth, fell
      down in horrible convulsions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are right. &lsquo;Twas indeed frightful. And, not
      withstanding every assistance this victim of Morok&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died during the night, in dreadful agony; for the shock had been so
      violent, that brain-fever almost instantly declared itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is Morok dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. He was to be taken to another hospital, after being
      fast bound in the state of weakness which generally succeeds the fit. But,
      till he can be removed he has been confined in a room upstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he cannot recover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he must be dead by this time. The doctors did not
      give him twenty-four hours to live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons engaged in this conversation were standing in an ante-chamber
      on the ground-floor, in which usually assembled those who came to offer
      their voluntary aid to the sick. One door of this room communicated with
      the rest of the hospital, and the other with the passage that opened upon
      the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said one of the two speakers, looking through the
      window. &ldquo;See what two charming girls have just got out of that
      elegant carriage. How much alike they are! Such a resemblance is indeed
      extraordinary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt they are twins. Poor young girls! dressed in Mourning.
      They have perhaps lost father or mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would imagine they are coming this way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are coming up the steps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed Rose and Blanche soon entered the antechamber, with a timid,
      anxious air, though a sort of feverish excitement was visible in their
      looks. One of the two men that were talking together, moved by the
      embarrassment of the girls, advanced toward them, and said, in a tone of
      attentive politeness: &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you, ladies?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not this, sir,&rdquo; replied Rose, &ldquo;the infirmary of the
      Rue du Mont Blanc?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady, called Madame Augustine du Tremblay, was brought here, we
      are told, about two days ago. Could we see her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would observe to you, miss, that there is some danger in entering
      the sick-wards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a dear friend that we wish to see,&rdquo; answered Rose, in a
      mild and firm tone, which sufficiently expressed that she was determined
      to brave the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot be sure, miss,&rdquo; resumed the other, &ldquo;that the
      person you seek is here; but, if you will take the trouble to walk into
      this room on the left, you will find there the good Sister Martha; she has
      the care of the women&rsquo;s wards, and will give you all the information
      you can desire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Blanche, with a graceful bow; and she
      and her sister entered together the apartment which had been pointed out
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are really charming,&rdquo; said the man, looking after the
      two sisters, who soon disappeared from his view. &ldquo;It would be a
      great pity if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unable to finish. A frightful tumult, mingled with cries of alarm
      and horror, rose suddenly from the adjoining rooms. Almost instantly, two
      doors were thrown open, and a number of the sick, half-naked, pale,
      fleshless, and their features convulsed with terror, rushed into the
      antechamber, exclaiming: &ldquo;Help! help! the madman!&rdquo; It is
      impossible to paint the scene of despairing and furious confusion which
      followed this panic of so many affrighted wretches, flying to the only
      other door, to escape from the perils they dreaded, and there, struggling
      and trampling on each other to pass through the narrow entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when the last of these unhappy creatures succeeded in
      reaching the door, dragging himself along upon his bleeding hands, for he
      had been thrown down and almost crushed in the confusion&mdash;Morok, the
      object of so much terror&mdash;Morok himself appeared. He was a horrible
      sight. With the exception of a rag bound about his middle, his wan form
      was entirely naked, and from his bare legs still hung the remnants of the
      cords he had just broken. His thick, yellow hair stood almost on end, his
      beard bristled, his savage eyes rolled full of blood in their orbits, and
      shone with a glassy brightness; his lips were covered with foam; from time
      to time, he uttered hoarse, guttural cries. The veins, visible on his iron
      limbs were swollen almost to bursting. He bounded like a wild beast, and
      stretched out before him his bony and quivering hands. At the moment Morok
      reached the doorway, by which those he pursued made their escape, some
      persons, attracted by the noise, managed to close this door from without,
      whilst others secured that which communicated with the sick-ward.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30381.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Morok thus found himself a prisoner. He ran to the window to force it
      open, and threw himself into the courtyard. But, stopping suddenly, he
      drew back from the glittering panes, seized with that invincible horror
      which all the victims of hydrophobia feel at the sight of any shining
      object, particularly glass. The unfortunate creatures whom he had pursued,
      saw him from the courtyard exhausting himself in furious efforts to open
      the doors that just had been closed upon him. Then, perceiving the
      inutility of his attempts, he uttered savage cries, and rushed furiously
      round the room, like a wild beast that seeks in vain to escape from its
      cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, suddenly, those spectators of this scene, who had approached nearest
      to the window, uttered a loud exclamation of fear and anguish. Morok had
      perceived the little door which led to the closet occupied by Sister
      Martha, where Rose and Blanche had entered a few minutes before. Hoping to
      get out by this way, Morok drew the door violently towards him, and
      succeeded in half opening it, notwithstanding the resistance he
      experienced from the inside. For an instant the affrighted crowd saw the
      stiffened arms Of Sister Martha and the orphans, clinging to the door, and
      holding it back with all their might.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. HYDROPHOBIA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the sick
      people, assembled in the courtyard, saw the desperate efforts of Morok to
      force the door of the room which contained Sister Martha and the orphans,
      their fright redoubled. &ldquo;It is all over, Sister Martha!&rdquo; cried
      they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door will give way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the closet has no other entrance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two young girls in mourning with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! we must not leave these poor women to encounter the madman.
      Follow me, friends!&rdquo; cried generously one of the spectators, who was
      still blessed with health, and he rushed towards the steps to return to
      the ante-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late! it&rsquo;s only exposing yourself in vain,&rdquo;
      cried many persons, holding him back by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, voices were heard, exclaiming: &ldquo;Here is the Abbe
      Gabriel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming downstairs. He has heard the noise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is asking what is the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will he do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel, occupied with a dying person in a neighboring room, had, indeed,
      just learned that Morok, having broken his bonds, had succeeded in
      escaping from the chamber in which he had been temporarily confined.
      Foreseeing the terrible dangers which might result from the escape of the
      lion-tamer, the missionary consulted only his courage, and hastened down,
      in the hope of preventing greater misfortunes. In obedience to his orders,
      an attendant followed him, bearing a brazier full of hot cinders, on which
      lay several irons, at a white heat, used by the doctors for cauterizing,
      in desperate cases of cholera.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angelic countenance of Gabriel was very pale; but calm intrepidity
      shone upon his noble brow. Hastily crossing the passage, and making his
      way through the crowd, he went straight to the ante-chamber door. As he
      approached it, one of the sick people said to him, in a lamentable voice;
      &ldquo;Ah, sir! it is all over. Those who can see through the window say
      that Sister Martha is lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabriel made no answer, but grasped the key of the door. Before entering
      the room, however, he turned to the attendant, and said to him in a firm
      voice: &ldquo;Are the irons of a white heat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then wait here, and be ready. As for you, my friends,&rdquo; he
      added, turning to some of the sick, who shuddered with terror, &ldquo;as
      soon as I enter shut the door after me. I will answer for the rest. And
      you; friend, only bring your irons when I call.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the young missionary turned the key in the lock. At this juncture, a
      cry of alarm, pity, and admiration rose from every lip, and the spectators
      drew back from the door, with an involuntary feeling of fear. Raising his
      eyes to heaven, as if to invoke its assistance at this terrible moment,
      Gabriel pushed open the door, and immediately closed it behind him. He was
      alone with Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion-tamer, by a last furious effort, had almost succeeded in opening
      the door, to which Sister Martha and the orphans were clinging, in a fit
      of terror, uttering piercing cries. At the sound of Gabriel&rsquo;s
      footsteps, Morok turned round suddenly. Then, instead of continuing his
      attack on the closet, he sprang, with a roar and a bound, upon the
      new-comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Sister Martha and the orphans, not knowing the cause of
      the sudden retreat of their assailant, took advantage of the opportunity
      to close and bolt the door, and thus placed themselves in security from a
      new attack. Morok, with haggard eye, and teeth convulsively clinched, had
      rushed upon Gabriel, his hands extended to seize him by the throat. The
      missionary stood the shock valiantly. Guessing, at a glance, the intention
      of his adversary, he seized him by the wrists as he advanced, and, holding
      him back, bent him down violently with a vigorous hand. For a second,
      Morok and Gabriel remained mute, breathless, motionless, gazing on each
      other; then the missionary strove to conquer the efforts of the madman,
      who, with violent jerks, attempted to throw himself upon him, and to seize
      and tear him with his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the lion-tamer&rsquo;s strength seemed to fail, his knees
      quivered, his livid head sank upon his shoulder, his eyes closed. The
      missionary, supposing that a momentary weakness had succeeded to the fit
      of rage, and that the wretch was about to fall, relaxed his hold in order
      to lend him assistance. But no sooner did he feel himself at liberty,
      thanks to his crafty device, than Morok flung himself furiously upon
      Gabriel. Surprised by this sudden attack, the latter stumbled, and at once
      felt himself clasped into the iron arms of the madman. Yet, with redoubled
      strength and energy, struggling breast to breast, foot to foot, the
      missionary in his turn succeeded in tripping up his adversary, and,
      throwing him with a vigorous effort, again seized his hands, and now held
      him down beneath his knee. Having thus completely mastered him, Gabriel
      turned his head to call for assistance, when Morok, by a desperate strain,
      succeeded in raising himself a little, and seized with his teeth the left
      arm of the missionary. At this sharp, deep, horrible bite, which
      penetrated to the very bone, Gabriel could not restrain a scream of
      anguish and horror. He strove in vain to disengage himself, for his arm
      was held fast, as in a vice, between the firm-set jaws of Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      This frightful scene had lasted less time than it has taken in the
      description, when suddenly the door leading to the passage was violently
      opened, and several courageous men, who had learned from the patients to
      what danger the young priest was exposed, came rushing to his assistance,
      in spite of his recommendation not to enter till he should call. The
      attendant was amongst the number, with the brazier and the hot irons.
      Gabriel, as soon as he perceived him, said to him in an agitated voice:
      &ldquo;Quick, friend! your iron. Thank God I had thought of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men who had entered the room was luckily provided with a
      blanket; and the moment the missionary succeeded in wresting his arm from
      the clinched teeth of Morok, whom he still held down with his knee, this
      blanket was thrown over the madman&rsquo;s head, so that he could now be
      held and bound without danger, notwithstanding his desperate resistance.
      Then Gabriel rose, tore open the sleeve of his cassock, and laying bare
      his left arm, on which a deep bite was visible, bleeding, of a bluish
      color, he beckoned the attendant to draw near, seized one of the hot
      irons, and, with a firm and sure hand, twice applied the burning metal to
      the wound, with a calm heroism which struck all the spectators, with
      admiration. But soon so many various emotions, intrepidly sustained, were
      followed by a natural reaction. Large drops of sweat stood upon Gabriel&rsquo;s
      brow; his long light hair clung to his temples; he grew deadly pale,
      reeled, lost his senses, and was carried into the next room to receive
      immediate attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      An accidental circumstance, likely enough to occur, had converted one of
      the Princess de Saint-Dizier&rsquo;s falsehoods into a truth. To induce
      the orphans to go to the hospital, she had told them Gabriel was there,
      which at the time she was far from believing. On the contrary, she would
      have wished to prevent a meeting, which, from the attachment of the
      missionary to the girls, might interfere with her projects. A little while
      after the terrible scene we have just related, Rose and Blanche,
      accompanied by Sister Martha, entered a vast room, of a strange and fatal
      aspect, containing a number of women who had suddenly been seized with
      cholera.
    </p>
    <p>
      These immense apartments, generously supplied for the purpose of a
      temporary hospital, had been furnished with excessive luxury. The room now
      occupied by the sick women, of whom we speak, had been used for a
      ball-room. The white panels glittered with sumptuous gilding, and
      magnificent pier-glasses occupied the spaces between the windows, through
      which could be seen the fresh verdure of a pleasant garden, smiling
      beneath the influence of budding May. In the midst of all this gilded
      luxury, on a rich, inlaid floor of costly woods, were seen arranged in
      regular order four rows of beds, of every shape and kind, from the humble
      truckle-bed to the handsome couch in carved mahogany.
    </p>
    <p>
      This long room was divided into two compartments by a temporary partition,
      four or five feet in height. They had thus been able to manage the four
      rows of beds. This partition finished at some little distance from either
      end of the room, so as to leave an open space without beds, for the
      volunteer attendants, when the sick did not require their aid. At one of
      these extremities of the room was a lofty and magnificent marble chimney
      piece, ornamented with gilt bronze. On the fire beneath, various drinks
      were brewing for the patients. To complete the singular picture, women of
      every class took their turns in attending upon the sick, to whose sighs
      and groans they always responded with consoling words of hope and pity.
      Such was the place, strange and mournful, that Rose and Blanche entered
      together, hand in hand, a short time after Gabriel had displayed such
      heroic courage in the struggle against Morok. Sister Martha accompanied
      Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters. After speaking a few words to them in a
      whisper, she pointed out to them the two divisions in which the beds were
      arranged, and herself went to the other end of the room to give some
      orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphans, still under the impression of the terrible danger from which
      Gabriel had rescued them without their knowing it, were both excessively
      pale; yet their eyes were expressive of firm resolution. They had
      determined not only to perform what they considered an imperative duty,
      but to prove themselves worthy of their valiant father; they were acting
      too for their mother&rsquo;s sake, since they had been told that, dying in
      Siberia without receiving the sacrament, her eternal felicity might depend
      on the proofs they gave of Christian devotion. Need we add that the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier, following the advice of Rodin, had, in a second
      interview, skillfully brought about without the knowledge of Dagobert,
      taken advantage of the excitable qualities of these poor, confiding,
      simple, and generous souls, by a fatal exaggeration of the most noble and
      courageous sentiments. The orphans having asked Sister Martha if Madame
      Augustine du Tremblay had been brought to this asylum within the last
      three days, that person had answered, that she really did not know, but,
      if they would go through the women&rsquo;s wards, it would be easy for
      them to ascertain. For the abominable hypocrite, who, in conjunction with
      Rodin, had sent these two children to encounter a mortal peril, had told
      an impudent falsehood when she affirmed that their governess had been
      removed to this hospital. During their exile, and their toilsome journey
      with Dagobert, the sisters had been exposed to many hard trials. But never
      had they witnessed so sad a spectacle as that which now offered itself to
      their view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long row of beds, on which so many poor creatures writhed in agony,
      some uttering deep groans, some only a dull rattle in the throat, some
      raving in the delirium of fever, or calling on those from whom they were
      about to part forever&mdash;these frightful sights and sounds, which are
      too much even for brave men, would inevitably, (such was the execrable
      design of Rodin and his accomplices) make a fatal impression on these
      young girls, urged by the most generous motives to undertake this perilous
      visit. And then&mdash;sad memory! which awoke, in all its deep and
      poignant bitterness, by the side of the first beds they came to&mdash;it
      was of this very malady, the Cholera, that their mother had died a painful
      death. Fancy the twins entering this vast room, of so fearful an aspect,
      and, already much shaken by the terror which Morok had inspired, pursuing
      their search in the midst of these unfortunate creatures, whose dying
      pangs reminded them every instant of the dying agony of their mother! For
      a moment, at sight of the funeral hall, Rose and Blanche had felt their
      resolution fail them. A black presentiment made them regret their heroic
      imprudence; and, moreover, since several minutes they had begun to feel an
      icy shudder, and painful shootings across the temples; but, attributing
      these symptoms to the fright occasioned by Morok, their good and valiant
      natures soon stifled all these fears. They exchanged glances of affection,
      their courage revived, and both of them&mdash;Rose on one side of the
      partition, and Blanche on the other&mdash;proceeded with their painful
      task. Gabriel, carried to the doctors&rsquo; private room, had soon
      recovered his senses. Thanks to his courage and presence of mind, his
      wound, cauterized in time, could have no dangerous consequences. As soon
      as it was dressed he insisted on returning to the women&rsquo;s ward,
      where he had be offering pious consolations to a dying person at the
      moment they had come to inform him of the frightful danger caused by the
      escape of Morok.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes before the missionary entered the room, Rose and Blanche
      arrived almost together at the term of their mournful search, one from the
      left, the other from the right-hand row of beds, separated by the
      partition which divided the hall into compartments. The sisters had not
      yet seen each other. Their steps tottered as they advanced, and they were
      forced, from time to time, to lean against the beds as they passed along.
      Their strength was&mdash;rapidly failing them. Giddy with fear and pain,
      they appeared to act almost mechanically. Alas! the orphans had been
      seized almost at the same moment with the terrible symptoms of cholera. In
      consequence of that species of physiological phenomenon, of which we have
      already spoken&mdash;a phenomenon by no means rare in twins, which had
      already been displayed on one or two occasions of their sickness&mdash;their
      organizations seemed liable to the same sensations, the same simultaneous
      accidents, like two flowers on one stem, which bloom and fade together.
      The sight of so much suffering, and so many deaths, had accelerated the
      development of this dreadful disease. Already, on their agitated and
      altered countenances, they bore the mortal tokens of the contagion, as
      they came forth, each on her own side, from the two subdivisions of the
      room in which they had vainly sought their governess. Until now separated
      by the partition, Rose and Blanche had not yet seen each other; but, when
      at length their eyes met, there ensued a heart rending scene.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII. THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o the charming
      freshness of the sisters&rsquo; faces had succeeded a livid pallor. Their
      large blue eyes, now hollow and sunk in, appeared of enormous dimensions.
      Their lips, once so rosy, were now suffused with a violet hue, and a
      similar color was gradually displacing the transparent carmine of their
      cheeks and fingers. It was as if all the roses in their charming
      countenances were fading and turning blue before the icy blast of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the orphans met, tottering and hardly able to sustain themselves, a
      cry of mutual horror burst from their lips. Each of them exclaimed, at
      sight of the fearful change in her sister&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;Are you
      also ill, sister?&rdquo; And then, bursting into tears, they threw
      themselves into each other&rsquo;s arms, and looked anxiously at one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, Rose! how pale you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you, sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you feel a cold shudder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and my sight fails me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bosom is all on fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, we are perhaps going to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it only be together!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our poor father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dagobert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister, our dream has come true!&rdquo; cried Rose, almost
      deliriously, as she threw her arms round Blanche&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Look!
      look! the Angel Gabriel is here to fetch us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, at this moment, Gabriel entered the open space at the end of the
      room. &ldquo;Heaven! what do I see?&rdquo; cried the young priest. &ldquo;The
      daughters of Marshal Simon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, rushing forward, he received the sisters in his arms, for they were
      no longer able to stand. Already their drooping heads, their half-closed
      eyes, their painful and difficult breathing, announced the approach of
      death. Sister Martha was close at hand. She hastened to respond to the
      call of Gabriel. Aided by this pious woman, he was able to lift the
      orphans upon a bed reserved for the doctor in attendance. For fear that
      the sight of this mournful agony should make too deep an impression on the
      other patients, Sister Martha drew a large curtain, and the sisters were
      thus in some sort walled off from the rest of the room. Their hands had
      been so tightly clasped together, during a nervous paroxysm, that it was
      impossible to separate them. It was in this position that the first
      remedies were applied&mdash;remedies incapable of conquering the violence
      of the disease, but which at least mitigated for a few moments the
      excessive pains they suffered, and restored some faint glimmer of
      perception to their obscured and troubled senses. At this moment, Gabriel
      was leaning over the bed with a look of inexpressible grief. With breaking
      heart, and face bathed in tears, he thought of the strange destiny, which
      thus made him a witness of the death of these girls, his relations, whom
      but a few months before he had rescued from the horrors of the tempest. In
      spite of his firmness of soul, the missionary could not help shuddering as
      he reflected on the fate of the orphans, the death of Jacques Rennepont,
      and the fearful devices by which M. Hardy, retired to the cloistered
      solitude of St. Herein, had become a member of the Society of Jesus almost
      in dying. The missionary said to himself, that already four members of the
      Rennepont family&mdash;his family&mdash;had been successively struck down
      by some dreadful fate; and he asked himself with alarm, how it was that
      the detestable interests of the Society of Loyola should be served by a
      providential fatality? The astonishment of the young missionary would have
      given place to the deepest horror, could he have known the part that Rodin
      and his accomplices had taken, both in the death of Jacques Rennepont, by
      exciting, through Morok, the evil propensities of the artisan, and in the
      approaching end of Rose and Blanche, by converting, through the Princess
      de Saint-Dizier, the generous inspirations of the orphans into suicidal
      heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roused for a moment from the painful stupor in which they had been
      plunged, Rose and Blanche half-opened their large eyes, already dull and
      faded. Then, more and more bewildered they both gazed fixedly at the
      angelic countenance of Gabriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Rose, in a faint voice, &ldquo;do you see the
      archangel&mdash;as in our dreams, in Germany?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;three days ago&mdash;he appeared to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is come to fetch us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! will our death save our poor mother from purgatory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angel! blessed angel! pray God for our mother&mdash;and for us!&rdquo;
      Until now, stupefied with amazement and sorrow, almost suffocated with
      sobs, Gabriel had not been able to utter a word. But at these words of the
      orphans, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Dear children, why doubt of your mother&rsquo;s
      salvation? Oh! never did a purer soul ascend to its Creator. Your mother?
      I know from my adopted father, that her virtues and courage were the
      admiration of all who knew her. Oh! believe me; God has blessed her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, sister?&rdquo; cried Rose, as a ray of celestial joy
      illumined for an instant the livid faces of the orphans. &ldquo;God has
      blessed our mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; resumed Gabriel; &ldquo;banish these gloomy ideas.
      Take courage, poor children! You must not die. Think of your father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our father?&rdquo; said Blanche, shuddering; and she continued,
      with a mixture of reason and wild excitement, which would have touched the
      soul of the most indifferent: &ldquo;Alas! he will not find us on his
      return. Forgive us, father! we did not think to do any harm. We wished,
      like you, to do something generous&mdash;to help our governess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we did not think to die so quickly, and so soon. Yesterday, we
      were gay and happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good angel! you will appear to our father, even as you have
      appeared to us. You will tell him that, in dying&mdash;the last thought of
      his children&mdash;was of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came here without Dagobert&rsquo;s knowing it&mdash;do not let
      our father scold him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed angel!&rdquo; resumed the other sister in a still more
      feeble voice; &ldquo;appear to Dagobert, also. Tell him, that we ask his
      forgiveness, for the grief our death will occasion him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let our old friend caress our poor Spoil-sport for us&mdash;our
      faithful guardian,&rdquo; added Blanche, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; resumed Rose, in a voice that was growing still
      fainter, &ldquo;promise to appear to two other persons, that have been so
      kind to us&mdash;good Mother Bunch&mdash;and the beautiful Lady Adrienne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We forget none whom we have loved,&rdquo; said Blanche, with a last
      effort. &ldquo;Now, God grant we may go to our mother, never to leave her
      more!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised it good angel&mdash;you know you did&mdash;in the
      dream. You said to us: &lsquo;Poor children&mdash;come from so far&mdash;you
      will have traversed the earth&mdash;to rest on the maternal bosom!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is dreadful&mdash;dreadful! So young&mdash;and no hope!&rdquo;
      murmured Gabriel, as he buried his face in his hands. &ldquo;Almighty
      Father! Thy views are impenetrable. Alas! yet why should these children
      die this cruel death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose heaved a deep sigh and said in an expiring tone: &ldquo;Let us be
      buried together!&mdash;united in life, in death not divided&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two turned their dying looks upon Gabriel, and stretched out
      towards him their supplicating hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, blessed martyrs to a generous devotion!&rdquo; cried the
      missionary, raising to heaven his eyes streaming with tears. &ldquo;Angelic
      souls! treasures of innocence and truth! ascend, ascend to heaven&mdash;since
      God calls you to him, and the earth is not worthy to possess you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister! father!&rdquo; were the last words that the orphans
      pronounced with their dying voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the twins, by a last instinctive impulse, endeavored to clasp
      each other, and their eyes half-opened to exchange yet another glance.
      They shuddered twice or thrice, their limbs stiffened, a deep sigh
      struggled from their violet-colored lips. Rose and Blanche were both dead!
      Gabriel and Sister Martha, after closing the eyes of the orphans, knelt
      down to pray by the side of that funeral couch. Suddenly a great tumult
      was heard in the room. Rapid footsteps, mingled with imprecations, sounded
      close at hand, the curtain was drawn aside from this mournful scene, and
      Dagobert entered precipitately, pale, haggard, his dress in disorder. At
      sight of Gabriel and the Sister of Charity kneeling beside the corpses of
      his children, the soldier uttered a terrible roar, and tried to advance&mdash;but
      in vain&mdash;for, before Gabriel could reach him, Dagobert fell flat on
      the ground, and his gray head struck violently on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is night&mdash;a dark and stormy night. One o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning has just sounded from the church of Montmartre. It is to the
      cemetery of Montmartre that is carried the coffin which, according to the
      last wishes of Rose and Blanche contains them both. Through the thick
      shadow, which rests upon that field of death, may be seen moving a pale
      light. It is the gravedigger. He advances with caution; a dark lantern is
      in his hand. A man wrapped in a cloak accompanies him. He holds down his
      head and weeps. It is Samuel. The old Jew&mdash;the keeper of the house in
      the Rue Saint-Francois. On the night of the funeral of Jacques Rennepont,
      the first who died of the seven heirs, and who was buried in another
      cemetery, Samuel had a similar mysterious interview with the gravedigger,
      to obtain a favor at the price of gold. A strange and awful favor! After
      passing down several paths, bordered with cypress trees, by the side of
      many tombs, the Jew and the gravedigger arrived, at a little glade,
      situated near the western wall of the cemetery. The night was so dark,
      that scarcely anything could be seen. After moving his lantern up and
      down, and all about, the gravedigger showed Samuel, at the foot of a tall
      yew-tree, with long black branches, a little mound of newly-raised earth,
      and said: &ldquo;It is here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;two bodies in one coffin! it is not such a common
      thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! two in the same coffin!&rdquo; said the Jew, with a deep
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you know the place, what do you want more?&rdquo; asked
      the gravedigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel did not answer. He fell on his knees, and piously kissed the little
      mound. Then rising, with his cheeks bathed in tears, he approached the
      gravedigger, and spoke to him for some moments in a whisper&mdash;though
      they were alone, and in the centre of that deserted place. Then began
      between those two men a mysterious dialogue, which the night enveloped in
      shade and silence. The gravedigger, alarmed at what Samuel asked him, at
      first refused his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Jew, employing persuasions, entreaties, tears, and at last the
      seduction of the jingling gold, succeeded in conquering the scruples of
      the gravedigger. Though the latter trembled at the thought of what he
      promised, he said to Samuel in an agitated tone: &ldquo;To-morrow night,
      then, at two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be behind the wall,&rdquo; answered Samuel, pointing out
      the place with the aid of a lantern. &ldquo;I will throw three stones into
      the cemetery, for a signal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, three stones&mdash;as a signal,&rdquo; replied the gravedigger
      shuddering, and wiping the cold sweat from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      With considerable remains of vigor, notwithstanding his great age, Samuel
      availed himself of the broken surface of the low wall, and climbing over
      it, soon disappeared. The gravedigger returned home with hasty strides.
      From time to time, he looked fearfully behind him, as though he had been
      pursued by some fatal vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening after the funeral of Rose and Blanche, Rodin wrote two
      letters. The first, addressed to his mysterious correspondent at Rome,
      alluded to the deaths of Jacques Rennepont, and Rose and Blanche Simon, as
      well as to the cession of M. Hardy&rsquo;s property, and the donation of
      Gabriel&mdash;events which reduced the claimants of the inheritance to two&mdash;Mdlle.
      de Cardoville and Djalma. This first note written by Rodin for Rome,
      contained only the following words: &ldquo;Five from seven leaves two.
      Announce this result to the Cardinal-Prince. Let him go on. I advance
      advance-advance!&rdquo; The second note, in a feigned hand, was addressed
      to Marshal Simon, to be delivered by a sure messenger, contained these few
      lines: &ldquo;If there is yet time, make haste to return. Your daughters
      are both dead. You shall learn who killed them.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII. RUIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is the day after
      the death of Marshal Simon&rsquo;s daughters. Mdlle. de Cardoville is yet
      ignorant of the sad end of her young relatives. Her countenance is radiant
      with happiness, and never has she looked more beautiful; her eye has never
      been more brilliant, her complexion more dazzling white, her lip of a
      richer coral. According to her somewhat eccentric custom of dressing
      herself in her own house in a picturesque style, Adrienne wears to-day,
      though it is about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, a pale green
      watered-silk dress, with a very full skirt, the sleeves and bodice slashed
      with rose-colored ribbon, and adorned with white bugle-beads, of exquisite
      workmanship; while a slender network, also of white bugle-beads,
      concealing the thick plait of Adrienne&rsquo;s back hair, forms an
      oriental head-dress of charming originality, and contrasts agreeably with
      the long curls which fall in front almost to the swell of the bosom. To
      the expression of indescribable happiness which marks the features of
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, is added a certain resolute, cutting, satirical air,
      which is not habitual to her. Her charming head, and graceful, swan-like
      neck, are raised in an attitude of defiance; her small, rose-colored
      nostrils seem to dilate with ill-repressed ardor, and she waits with
      haughty impatience for the moment of an aggressive and ironical interview.
      Not far from Adrienne is Mother Bunch. She has resumed in the house the
      place which she at first occupied. The young sempstress is in mourning for
      her sister, but her countenance is expressive of a mild, calm sorrow. She
      looks at Mdlle. de Cardoville with surprise; for never, till now, has she
      seen the features of the fair patrician impressed with such a character of
      ironical audacity. Mdlle. de Cardoville was exempt from the slightest
      coquetry, in the narrow and ordinary sense of the word. Yet she now cast
      an inquiring look at the glass before which she was standing, and, having
      restored the elastic smoothness to one of her long, golden curls, by
      rolling it for a moment round her ivory finger, she carefully effaced with
      her hands some almost imperceptible folds, which had formed themselves in
      the thick material of her elegant corsage. This movement, and that of
      turning her back to the glass, to see if her dress sat perfectly on all
      points, revealed, in serpentine undulations, all the charms and graces of
      her light and elegant figure; for, in spite of the rich fulness of her
      shoulders, white and firm as sculptured alabaster, Adrienne belonged to
      that class of privileged persons, who are able at need to make a girdle
      out of a garter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having performed, with indescribable grace, these charming evolutions of
      feminine coquetry, Adrienne turned towards Mother Bunch, whose surprise
      was still on the increase, and said to her, smiling: &ldquo;My dear
      Magdalen, do not laugh at my question&mdash;but what would you say to a
      picture, that should represent me as I am now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, lady&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are again, with your lady-ing,&rdquo; said Adrienne, in a
      tone of gentle reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Adrienne,&rdquo; resumed Mother Bunch, &ldquo;I think
      it would be a charming picture, for you are dressed, as usual with perfect
      taste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I not better dressed than on other days, my dear poetess? I
      began by telling you that I do not ask the question for my own sake,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose so,&rdquo; replied Mother Bunch, with a faint
      smile. &ldquo;It is certainly impossible to imagine anything that would
      suit you better. The light green and the pale rose-color, with the soft
      lustre of the white ornaments, harmonize so well with your golden hair,
      that I cannot conceive, I tell you, a more graceful picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker felt what she said, and she was happy to be able to express
      it, for we know the intense admiration of that poetic soul for all that
      was beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; went on Adrienne, gayly, &ldquo;I am glad, my dear,
      that you find me better dressed than usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said the hunchback, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only?&rdquo; repeated Adrienne, looking at her with an air of
      interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, only,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;if I have never seen
      you look more pretty, I have also never observed in your features the
      resolute and ironical expression which they had just now. It was like an
      air of impatient defiance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it was, my dear little Magdalen,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      throwing her arms round the girl&rsquo;s neck with joyous tenderness.
      &ldquo;I must kiss you, for having guessed it. You see, I expect a visit
      from my dear aunt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess de Saint-Dizier?&rdquo; cried Mother Bunch, in alarm.
      &ldquo;That wicked lady, who did you so much evil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same. She has asked for an interview, and I shall be
      delighted to receive her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a somewhat ironical and malicious delight, it is true,&rdquo;
      answered Adrienne, still more gayly. &ldquo;You shall judge for yourself.
      She regrets her gallantries, her beauty, her youth&mdash;even her size
      afflicts the holy woman!&mdash;and she will see me young, fair, beloved&mdash;and
      above all thin&mdash;yes, thin,&rdquo; added Mdlle. de Cardoville,
      laughing merrily. &ldquo;And you may imagine, my dear, how much envy and
      despair, the sight of a young, thin woman excites in a stout one of a
      certain age!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Mother Bunch, gravely, &ldquo;you speak in
      jest. And yet, I know not why, the coming of this princess alarms me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, gentle soul, be satisfied!&rdquo; answered Adrienne,
      affectionately. &ldquo;I do not fear this woman&mdash;I no longer have any
      fear of her&mdash;and to prove it to her confusion, I will treat her&mdash;a
      monster of hypocrisy and wickedness, who comes here, no doubt, on some
      abominable design&mdash;I will treat her as an inoffensive, ridiculous fat
      woman!&rdquo; And Adrienne again laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant here entered the room, and interrupted the mirth of Adrienne, by
      saying: &ldquo;The Princess de Saint-Dizier wishes to know if you can
      receive her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mdlle. de Cardoville; and the servant
      retired. Mother Bunch was about to rise and quit the room; but Adrienne
      held her back, and said to her, taking her hand with an air of serious
      tenderness: &ldquo;Stay, my dear friend, I entreat you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I wish&mdash;still in revenge, you know,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with a smile, &ldquo;to prove to her highness of Saint-Dizier, that I have
      an affectionate friend&mdash;that I have, in fact, every happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Adrienne,&rdquo; replied the other, timidly, &ldquo;consider&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! here is the princess. Remain! I ask it as a favor. The
      instinct of your heart will discover any snare she may have laid. Did not
      your affection warn me of the plots of Rodin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Bunch could not refuse such a request. She remained, but was about
      to draw back from the fireplace. Adrienne, however, took her by the hand,
      and made her resume her seat in the arm-chair, saying: &ldquo;My dear
      Magdalen, keep your place. You owe nothing to the lady. With me it is
      different; she comes to my house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Adrienne uttered these words, than the princess entered with
      head erect, and haughty air (we have said, she could carry herself most
      loftily), and advanced with a firm step. The strongest minds have their
      side of puerile weakness; a savage envy, excited by the elegance, wit, and
      beauty of Adrienne, bore a large part in the hatred of the princess for
      her niece; and though it was idle to think of eclipsing Adrienne, and the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier did not seriously mean to attempt it, she could
      not forbear, in preparing for the interview she had demanded, taking more
      pains even than usual in the arrangement of her dress. Beneath her robe of
      shot silk, she was laced in and tightened to excess&mdash;a pressure which
      considerably increased the color in her cheeks. The throng of jealous and
      hateful sentiments, which inspired her with regard to Adrienne, had so
      troubled the clearness of her ordinarily calm judgment, that, instead of
      the plain and quiet style, in which, as a woman of tact and taste, she was
      generally attired, she now committed the folly of wearing a dress of
      changing hues, and a crimson hat, adorned with a magnificent bird of
      paradise. Hate, envy, the pride of triumph&mdash;for she thought of the
      skillful perfidy with which she had sent to almost certain death the
      daughters of Marshal Simon&mdash;and the execrable hope of succeeding in
      new plots, were all expressed in the countenance of the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier, as she entered her niece&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without advancing to meet her aunt, Adrienne rose politely from the sofa
      on which she was seated, made a half-curtsey, full of grace and dignity,
      and immediately resumed her former posture. Then, pointing to an arm chair
      near the fireplace, at one corner of which sat Mother Bunch, and she
      herself at the other, she said: &ldquo;Pray sit down, your highness.&rdquo;
      The princess turned very red, remained standing, and cast a disdainful
      glance of insolent surprise at the sempstress, who, in compliance with
      Adrienne&rsquo;s wish, only bowed slightly at the entrance of the Princess
      de Saint-Dizier, without offering to give up her place. In acting thus,
      the young sempstress followed the dictates of her conscience, which told
      her that the real superiority did not belong to this base, hypocritical,
      and wicked princess, but rather to such a person as herself, the admirable
      and devoted friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me beg your highness to sit down,&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, in a
      mild tone, as she pointed to the vacant chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The interview I have demanded, niece,&rdquo; said the princess
      &ldquo;must be a private one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no secrets, madame, from my best friend; you may speak in
      the presence of this young lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long known,&rdquo; replied Madame de Saint-Dizier, with
      bitter irony, &ldquo;that in all things you care little for secrecy, and
      that you are easy in the choice of what you call your friends. But you
      will permit me to act differently from you. If you have no secrets,
      madame, I have&mdash;and I do not choose to confide them to the first
      comer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the pious lady glanced contemptuously at the sempstress. The
      latter, hurt at the insolent tone of the princess, answered mildly and
      simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see what can be the great difference between the first and
      the last comer to Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! can it speak!&rdquo; cried the princess, insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can at least answer, madame,&rdquo; replied Mother Bunch, in her
      calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see you alone, niece&mdash;is that clear?&rdquo; said the
      princess, impatiently, to her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but I do not quite understand your highness,&rdquo;
      said Adrienne, with an air of surprise. &ldquo;This young lady, who honors
      me with her friendship, is willing to be present at this interview, which
      you have asked for&mdash;I say she has consented to be present, for it
      needs, I confess, the kindest condescension in her to resign herself, from
      affection for me, to hear all the graceful, obliging, and charming things
      which you have no doubt come hither to communicate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo; began the princess, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to interrupt your highness,&rdquo; returned Adrienne, in
      a tone of perfect amenity, as if she were addressing the most flattering
      compliments to her visitor. &ldquo;To put you quite at your ease with the
      lady here, I will begin by informing you that she is quite aware of all
      the holy perfidies, pious wrongs, and devout infamies, of which you nearly
      made me the victim. She knows that you are a mother of the Church, such as
      one sees but few of in these days. May I hope, therefore, that your
      highness will dispense with this delicate and interesting reserve?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said the princess, with a sort of incensed
      amazement, &ldquo;I scarcely know if I wake or sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Adrienne, in apparent alarm; &ldquo;this doubt
      as to the state of your faculties is very shocking, madame. I see that the
      blood flies to your head, for your face sufficiently shows it; you seem
      oppressed, confined, uncomfortable&mdash;perhaps (we women may say so
      between ourselves), perhaps you are laced a little too tightly, madame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, pronounced by Adrienne with an air of warm interest and
      perfect simplicity, almost choked the princess with rage. She became
      crimson, seated herself abruptly, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Be it so, madame!
      I prefer this reception to any other. It puts me at my ease, as you say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it indeed, madame?&rdquo; said Adrienne, with a smile. &ldquo;You
      may now at least speak frankly all that you feel, which must for you have
      the charm of novelty! Confess that you are obliged to me for enabling you,
      even for a moment, to lay aside that mask of piety, amiability, and
      goodness, which must be so troublesome to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she listened to the sarcasms of Adrienne (an innocent and excusable
      revenge, if we consider all the wrongs she had suffered), Mother Bunch
      felt her heart sink within her; for she dreaded the malignity of the
      princess, who replied, with the utmost calmness: &ldquo;A thousand thanks,
      madame, for your excellent intentions and sentiments. I appreciate them as
      I ought, and I hope in a short time to prove it to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madame,&rdquo; said Adrienne, playfully, &ldquo;let us have
      it all at once. I am full of impatient curiosity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the princess, feigning in her turn a bitter
      and ironical delight, &ldquo;you are far from having the least notion of
      what I am about to announce to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! I fear that your highness&rsquo;s candor and modesty
      deceive you,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, with the same mocking affability;
      &ldquo;for there are very few things on your part that can surprise me,
      madame. You must be aware that from your highness, I am prepared for
      anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, madame,&rdquo; said the princess, laying great stress on
      her words, &ldquo;if, for instance, I were to tell you that within
      twenty-four hours&mdash;suppose between this and to-morrow-thou will be
      reduced to poverty&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so unexpected, that Mdlle. de Cardoville started in spite of
      herself, and Mother Bunch shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; said the princess, with triumphant joy and cruel
      mildness, as she watched the growing surprise of her niece, &ldquo;confess
      that I have astonished you a little. You were right in giving to our
      interview the turn it has taken. I should have needed all sorts of
      circumlocution to say to you, &lsquo;Niece, to-morrow you will be as poor
      as you are rich to day.&rsquo; But now I can tell you the fact quite
      plainly and simply.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering from her first amazement, Adrienne replied, with a calm smile,
      which checked the joy of the princess: &ldquo;Well, I confess frankly,
      madame, that you have surprised me; I expected from you one of those black
      pieces of malignity, one of those well-laid plots, in which you are known
      to excel, and I did not think you would make all this fuss about such a
      trifle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be ruined&mdash;completely ruined,&rdquo; cried the princess,
      &ldquo;and that by to morrow&mdash;you that have been so prodigal, will
      see your house, furniture, horses, jewels, even the ridiculous dresses of
      which you are so vain, all taken from you&mdash;do you call that a trifle?
      You, that spend with indifference thousands of louis, will be reduced to a
      pension inferior to the wages you gave your foot-boy&mdash;do you call
      that a trifle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To her aunt&rsquo;s cruel disappointment, Adrienne, who appeared quite to
      have recovered her serenity was about to answer accordingly, when the door
      suddenly opened, and, without being announced, Prince Djalma entered the
      room. A proud and tender expression of delight beamed from the radiant
      brow of Adrienne at sight of the prince, and it is impossible to describe
      the look of triumphant happiness and high disdain that she cast upon the
      Princess de Saint-Dizier. Djalma himself had never looked more handsome,
      and never had more intense happiness been impressed on a human
      countenance. The Hindoo wore a long robe of white Cashmere, adorned with
      innumerable stripes of gold and purple; his turban was of the same color
      and material; a magnificent figured shawl was twisted about his waist. On
      seeing the Indian, whom she had not hoped to meet at Mdlle. de Cardoville&rsquo;s,
      the Princess de Saint-Dizier could not at first conceal her extreme
      surprise. It was between these four, then, that the following scene took
      place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX. MEMORIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>jalma, having
      never before met the Princess de Saint-Dizier at Adrienne&rsquo;s, at
      first appeared rather astonished at her presence. The princess, keeping
      silence for a moment, contemplated with implacable hatred and envy those
      two beings, both so fair and young, so loving and happy. Suddenly she
      started, as if she had just remembered something of great importance, and
      for some seconds she remained absorbed in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne and Djalma availed themselves of this interval to gaze fondly on
      each other, with a sort of ardent idolatry, which filled their eyes with
      sweet tears. Then, at a movement of the Princess de Saint-Dizier, who
      seemed to rouse herself from her momentary trance, Mdlle. de Cardoville
      said to the young prince, with a smile: &ldquo;My dear cousin, I have to
      repair an omission (voluntary, I confess, and for good reasons), in never
      having before mentioned to you one of my relations, whom I have now the
      honor to present to you. The Princess de Saint-Dizier!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30407m.jpg" alt="30407m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30407.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Djalma bowed; but Mdlle. de Cardoville resumed, just as her aunt was about
      to make some reply: &ldquo;Her Highness of Saint-Dizier came very kindly
      to inform me of an event which is a most fortunate one for me, and of
      which I will speak to you hereafter, cousin&mdash;unless this amiable lady
      should wish to deprive me of the pleasure of making such a communication.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected arrival of the prince, and the recollections which had
      suddenly occurred to the princess, had no doubt greatly modified her first
      plans: for, instead of continuing the conversation with regard to Adrienne&rsquo;s
      threatened loss of fortune, the princess answered, with a bland smile,
      that covered an odious meaning: &ldquo;I should be sorry, prince, to
      deprive my dear and amiable niece of the pleasure of announcing to you the
      happy news to which she alludes, and which, as a near relative, I lost no
      time in communicating to her. I have here some notes on this subject,&rdquo;
      added the princess, delivering a paper to Adrienne, &ldquo;which I hope
      will prove, to her entire satisfaction, the reality of what I have
      announced to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, my dear aunt,&rdquo; said Adrienne, receiving
      the paper with perfect indifference; &ldquo;these precautions and proofs
      are quite superfluous. You know that I always believe you on your word,
      when it concerns your good feeling towards myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his ignorance of the refined perfidy and cruel politeness
      of civilized life, Djalma, endowed with a tact and fineness of perception
      common to most natures of extreme susceptibility, felt some degree of
      mental discomfort as he listened to this exchange of false compliments. He
      could not guess their full meaning, but they sounded hollow to his ear;
      and moreover, whether from instinct or presentiment, he had conceived a
      vague dislike for the Princess de Saint-Dizier. That pious lady, full of
      the great affair in hand, was a prey to the most violent agitation, which
      betrayed itself in the growing color of her cheeks, her bitter smile, and
      the malicious brightness of her glance. As he gazed on this woman, Djalma
      was unable to conquer his rising antipathy, and he remained silent and
      attentive, whilst his handsome countenance lost something of its former
      serenity. Mother Bunch also felt the influence of a painful impression.
      She glanced in terror at the princess, and then imploringly at Adrienne,
      as though she entreated the latter to but an end to an interview of which
      the young sempstress foresaw the fatal consequences. But, unfortunately,
      the Princess de Saint-Dizier was too much interested in prolonging this
      conversation; and Mdlle. de Cardoville, gathering new courage and
      confidence from the presence of the man she adored, took delight in vexing
      the princess with the exhibition of their happy love.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short silence, the Princess de Saint-Dizier observed, in a soft
      and insinuating tone: &ldquo;Really, prince, you cannot think how pleased
      I was to learn by public report (for people talk of nothing else, and with
      good reason) of your chivalrous attachment to my dear niece; for, without
      knowing it, you will extricate me from a difficult position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma made no answer, but he looked at Mdlle. de Cardoville with a
      surprised and almost sorrowful air, as if to ask what her aunt meant to
      insinuate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, not perceiving this mute interrogation, resumed as follows:
      &ldquo;I will express myself more clearly, prince. You can understand
      that, being the nearest relative of this dear, obstinate girl, I am more
      or less responsible for her conduct in the eyes of the world; and you,
      prince, seem just to have arrived on purpose, from the end of the earth,
      to take charge of a destiny which had caused me considerable apprehension.
      It is charming, it is excellent; and I know not which most to admire, your
      courage or your good fortune.&rdquo; The princess threw a glance of
      diabolical malice at Adrienne, and awaited her answer with an air of
      defiance.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to our good aunt, my dear cousin,&rdquo; said the young
      lady, smiling calmly. &ldquo;Since our affectionate kinswoman sees you and
      me united and happy, her heart is swelling with such a flood of joy, that
      it must run over, and the effects will be delightful. Only have a little
      patience, and you will behold them in their full beauty. I do not know,&rdquo;
      added Adrienne, in the most natural tone, &ldquo;why, in thinking of these
      outpourings of our dear aunt&rsquo;s affection, I should remember what you
      told me, cousin, of a certain viper in your country which sometimes, in a
      powerless bite, breaks its fangs, and, absorbing its own venom, becomes
      the victim of the poison it distills. Come, my dear aunt, you that had so
      good and noble a heart, I am sure you must feel interested in the fate of
      those poor vipers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess darted an implacable look at her niece, and replied, in an
      agitated voice, &ldquo;I do not see the object of this selection of
      natural history. Do you, prince?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma made no answer; leaning with his arm on the mantelpiece, he threw
      dark and piercing glances upon the princess. His involuntary hatred of
      this woman filled his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear aunt!&rdquo; resumed Adrienne, in a tone of
      self-reproach; &ldquo;have I presumed too much on the goodness of your
      heart? Have you not even sympathy for vipers? For whom, then, have you
      any? After all, I can very well understand it,&rdquo; added Adrienne, as
      if to herself; &ldquo;vipers are so thin. But, to lay aside these follies,&rdquo;
      she continued, gayly, as she saw the ill-repressed rage of the pious
      woman, &ldquo;tell us at once, my dear aunt, all the tender things which
      the sight of our happiness inspires.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to do so, my amiable niece. First, I must congratulate this
      dear prince, on having come so far to take charge, in all confidence, and
      with his eyes shut, of you, my poor child, whom we were obliged to confine
      as mad, in order to give a decent color to your excesses. You remember the
      handsome lad, that we found in your apartment. You cannot be so faithless,
      as already to have forgotten his name? He was a fine, youth, and a poet&mdash;one
      Agricola Baudoin&mdash;and was discovered in a secret place, attached to
      your bed-chamber. All Paris was amused with the scandal&mdash;for you are
      not about to marry an unknown person, dear prince; her name has been in
      every mouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these unexpected and dreadful words, Adrienne, Djalma, and Mother
      Bunch, though under the influence of different kinds of resentment,
      remained for a moment mute with surprise; and the princess, judging it no
      longer necessary to repress her infernal joy and triumphant hatred,
      exclaimed, as she rose from her seat, with flushed cheek, and flashing
      eyes, &ldquo;Yes, I defy you to contradict me. Were we not forced to
      confine you, on the plea of madness? And did we not find a workman (your
      lover) concealed in your bedroom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this horrible accusation, Djalma&rsquo;s golden complexion, transparent
      as amber, became suddenly the color of lead; his eyes, fixed and staring
      showed the white round the pupil&mdash;his upper lip, red as blood, was
      curled in a kind of wild convulsion, which exposed to view the firmly-set
      teeth&mdash;and his whole countenance became so frightfully threatening
      and ferocious, that Mother Bunch shuddered with terror. Carried away by
      the ardor of his blood, the young Oriental felt a sort of dizzy,
      unreflecting, involuntary rage&mdash;a fiery commotion, like that which
      makes the blood leap to the brave man&rsquo;s eyes and brain, when he
      feels a blow upon his face. If, during that moment, rapid as the passage
      of the lightning through the cloud, action could have taken the place of
      thought, the princess and Adrienne, Mother Bunch and himself, would all
      have been annihilated by an explosion as sudden and fatal as that of the
      bursting of a mine. He would have killed the princess, because she accused
      Adrienne of infamous deception he would have killed Adrienne, because she
      could even be suspected of such infamy&mdash;and Mother Bunch, for being a
      witness of the accusation&mdash;and himself, in order not to survive such
      horrid treachery. But, oh wonder! his furious and bloodshot gaze met the
      calm look of Adrienne&mdash;a look so full of dignity and serene
      confidence&mdash;and the expression of ferocious rage passed away like a
      flash of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more: to the great surprise of the princess and the young workgirl,
      as the glances which Djalma cast upon Adrienne went (as it were) deeper
      into that pure soul, not only did the Indian grow calm, but, by a kind of
      transfiguration, his countenance seemed to borrow her serene expression,
      and reflect, as in a mirror, the noble serenity impressed on the young
      lady&rsquo;s features. Let us explain physically this moral revolution, as
      consoling to the terrified workgirl, as provoking to the princess. Hardly
      had the princess distilled the atrocious calumny from her venomous lips,
      than Djalma, then standing before the fireplace, had, in the first
      paroxysm of his fury, advanced a step towards her; but, wishing as it were
      to moderate his rage, he held by the marble chimney-piece, which he
      grasped with iron strength. A convulsive trembling shook his whole body,
      and his features, altered and contracted, became almost frightful.
      Adrienne, on her part, when she heard the accusation, yielding to a first
      impulse of just indignation, even as Djalma had yielded to one of blind
      fury, rose abruptly, with offended pride flashing from her eyes; but,
      almost immediately appeased by the consciousness of her own purity, her
      charming face resumed its expression of adorable serenity. It was then
      that her eyes met Djalma&rsquo;s. For a second, the young lady was even
      more afflicted than terrified at the threatening and formidable expression
      of the young Indian&rsquo;s countenance. &ldquo;Can stupid indignity
      exasperate him to this degree?&rdquo; said Adrienne to herself. &ldquo;Does
      he suspect me; then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30423m.jpg" alt="30423m&rdquo; width=" /><br />

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30423.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      But to this reflection, as rapid as it was painful, succeeded the most
      lively joy, when the eyes of Adrienne rested for a short time on those of
      the Indian, and she saw his agitated countenance grow calm as if by magic,
      and become radiant and beautiful as before. Thus was the abominable plot
      of the princess de Saint-Dizier utterly confounded by the sincere and
      confiding expression of Adrienne&rsquo;s face. That was not all. At the
      moment, when, as a spectator of this mute and expressive scene (which
      proved so well the wondrous sympathy of those two beings, who, without
      speaking a word, had understood and satisfied each other), the princess
      was choking with rage and vexation&mdash;Adrienne, with a charming smile
      and gesture, extended her fair hand to Djalma, who, kneeling, imprinted on
      it a kiss of fire, which sent a light blush to the forehead of the young
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Hindoo, placing himself on the ermine carpet at the feet of
      Mdlle. de Cardoville, in an attitude full of grace: and respect, rested
      his chin on the palm of one of his hands, and gazed on her silently, in a
      sort of mute adoration&mdash;while Adrienne, bending over him with a happy
      smile &ldquo;looked at the babies in his eyes,&rdquo; as the song says,
      with as much amorous complacency, as if the hateful princess had not been
      present. But soon, as if something were wanting to complete her happiness,
      Adrienne beckoned to Mother Bunch, and made her sit down by her side.
      Then, with her hand clasped in that of this excellent friend, Mdlle. de
      Cardoville smiled on Djalma, stretched adoringly at her feet, and cast on
      the dismayed princess a look of such calm and firm serenity, so nobly
      expressive of the invincible quiet of her happiness, and her lofty disdain
      of all calumnious attacks, that the Princess de Saint-Dizier, confused and
      stupefied, murmured some hardly intelligible words, in a voice trembling
      with passion, and, completely losing her presence of mind, rushed towards
      the door. But, at this moment, the hunchback, who feared some ambush, some
      perfidious plot in the background, resolved, after exchanging a glance
      with Adrienne, to accompany the princess to her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angry disappointment of the Princess de Saint-Dizier, when she saw
      herself thus followed and watched, appeared so comical to Mdlle. de
      Cardoville that she could not help laughing aloud; and it was to the sound
      of contemptuous hilarity that the hypocritical princess, with rage and
      despair in her heart, quitted the house to which she had hoped to bring
      trouble end misery. Adrienne and Djalma were left alone. Before relating
      the scene which took place between them, a few retrospective words are
      indispensable. It will easily be imagined, that since Mdlle. de Cardoville
      and the Oriental had been brought into such close contact, after so many
      disappointments, their days had passed away like a dream of happiness.
      Adrienne had especially taken pains to bring to light, one by one, all the
      generous qualities of Djalma, of which she had read so much in her books
      of travels. The young lady had imposed on herself this tender and patient
      study of Djalma&rsquo;s character, not only to justify to her own mind the
      intensity of her love, but because this period of trial, to which she had
      assigned a term, enabled her to temper and divert the violence of Djalma&rsquo;s
      passion&mdash;a task the more meritorious, as she herself was of the same
      ardent temperament. For, in those two lovers, the finest qualities of
      sense and soul seemed exactly to balance each other, and heaven had
      bestowed on them the rarest beauty of form, and the most adorable
      excellence of heart, as if to legitimatize the irresistible attraction
      which drew and bound them together. What, then, was to be the term of this
      painful trial, which Adrienne had imposed on Djalma and on herself? This
      is what Mdlle. de Cardoville intended to tell the prince, in the interview
      she had with him, after the abrupt departure of the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX. THE ORDEAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>drienne de
      Cardoville and Djalma had remained alone. Such was the noble confidence
      which had succeeded in the Hindoo&rsquo;s mind to his first movement of
      unreflecting fury, caused by the infamous calumny, that, once alone with
      Adrienne, he did not even allude to that shameful accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her side (touching and admirable sympathy of those two hearts!), the
      young lady was too proud, conscious of the purity of her love, to descend
      to any justification of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have considered it an insult both to herself and him. Therefore,
      the lovers began their interview, as if the princess had never made any
      such remark. The same contempt was extended to the papers, which the
      princess had brought with her to prove the imminent ruin to which Adrienne
      was exposed. The young lady had laid them down, without reading them, on a
      stand within her reach. She made a graceful sign to Djalma to seat himself
      by her side, and accordingly he quitted, not without regret, the place he
      had occupied at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; said Adrienne, in a grave and tender voice, &ldquo;you
      have often impatiently asked me, when would come the term of the trial we
      have laid upon ourselves. That moment is at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma started, and could not restrain a cry of surprise and joy; but this
      almost trembling exclamation was so soft and sweet, that it seemed rather
      the expression of ineffable gratitude, than of exulting passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne continued: &ldquo;Separated&mdash;surrounded by treachery and
      fraud&mdash;mutually deceived as to each other&rsquo;s sentiments&mdash;we
      yet loved on, and in that followed an irresistible attraction, stronger
      than every opposing influence. But since then, in these days of happy
      retirement from the world, we have learned to value and esteem each other
      more. Left to ourselves in perfect freedom, we have had the courage to
      resist every temptation, that hereafter we might be happy without remorse.
      During these days, in which our hearts had been laid open to each other,
      we have read them thoroughly. Yes, Djalma! I believe in you, and you in me&mdash;I
      find in you all that you find in me&mdash;every possible human security
      for our future happiness. But this love must yet be consecrated; and in
      the eyes of the world, in which we are called upon to live, marriage is
      the only consecration, and marriage enchains one&rsquo;s whole life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma looked at the young lady with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one&rsquo;s whole life! and yet who can answer for the
      sentiments of a whole life?&rdquo; resumed Adrienne. &ldquo;A God, that
      could see into the future, could alone bind irrevocably certain hearts for
      their own happiness; but, alas! to human eyes the future is impenetrable.
      Therefore, to accept indissoluble ties, for any longer than one can answer
      for a present sentiment, is to commit an act of selfish and impious folly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma made no reply, but, with an almost respectful gesture, he urged the
      speaker to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; proceeded she, with a mixture of tenderness and
      pride, &ldquo;from respect for your dignity and mine, I would never
      promise to keep a law made by man against woman, with contemptuous and
      brutal egotism&mdash;a law, which denies to woman soul, mind, and heart&mdash;a
      law, which none can accept, without being either a slave or perjured&mdash;a
      law, which takes from the girl her name, reduces the wife to a state of
      degrading inferiority, denies to the mother all rights over her own
      children, and enslaves one human creature to the will of another, who is
      in all respects her equal in the sight of God!&mdash;You know, my love,&rdquo;
      added the young lady, with passionate enthusiasm, &ldquo;how much I honor
      you, whose father was called the Father of the Generous. I do not then
      fear, noble and valiant heart, to see you use against me these tyrannical
      powers; but, throughout my life, I never uttered a falsehood, and our love
      is too sacred and celestial to be purchased by a double perjury. No, never
      will I swear to observe a law, that my dignity, and my reason refuse to
      sanction. If, to-morrow, the freedom of divorce were established, and the
      rights of women recognized, I should be willing to observe usages, which
      would then be in accordance with my conscience, and with what is just,
      possible, and humane.&rdquo; Then, after a pause, Adrienne continued, with
      such deep and sweet emotion, that a tear of tenderness veiled her
      beauteous eyes: &ldquo;Oh! if you knew, my love, what your love is to me:
      if you knew how dear and sacred I hold your happiness&mdash;you would
      excuse, you would understand, these generous superstitions of a loving and
      honest heart, which could only see a fatal omen in forms degraded by
      falsehood and perjury. What I wish, is, to attach you by love, to bind you
      in chains of happiness&mdash;and to leave you free, that I may owe your
      constancy only to your affection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma had listened to the young girl with passionate attention. Proud and
      generous himself, he admired this proud and generous character. After a
      moment&rsquo;s meditative silence, he answered, in his sweet, sonorous
      voice, in an almost solemn tone: &ldquo;Like you, I hold in detestation,
      falsehood and perjury. Like you, I think that man degrades himself, by
      accepting the right of being a cowardly tyrant, even though resolved never
      to use the power. Like you, I could not bear the thought, that I owed all
      I most valued, not to your love alone, but to the eternal constraint of an
      indissoluble bond. Like you, I believe there is no dignity but in freedom.
      But you have said, that, for this great and holy love, you demand a
      religious consecration; and if you reject vows, that you cannot make
      without folly and perjury, are there then others, which your reason and
      your heart approve?&mdash;Who will pronounce the required blessing? To
      whom must these vows be spoken?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few days, my love, I believe I shall be able to tell you all.
      Every evening, after your departure, I have no other thought. I wish to
      find the means of uniting yourself and me&mdash;in the eyes of God, not of
      the law&mdash;without offending the habits and prejudices of a world, in
      which it may suit us hereafter to live. Yes, my friend! when you know
      whose are the noble hands, that are to join ours together, who is to bless
      and glorify God in our union&mdash;a sacred union, that will leave us
      worthy and free&mdash;you will say, I am sure, that never purer hands
      could have been laid upon us. Forgive me, friend! all this is in earnest&mdash;yes,
      earnest as our love, earnest as our happiness. If my words seem to you
      strange, my thoughts unreasonable, tell it me, love! We will seek and find
      some better means, to reconcile that we owe to heaven, with what we owe to
      the world and to ourselves. It is said, that lovers are beside themselves,&rdquo;
      added the young lady, with a smile, &ldquo;but I think that no creatures
      are more reasonable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I hear you speak thus of our happiness,&rdquo; said Djalma,
      deeply moved, &ldquo;with so much calm and earnest tenderness, I think I
      see a mother occupied with the future prospects of her darling child&mdash;trying
      to surround him with all that can make him strong, valiant, and generous&mdash;trying
      to remove far from him all that is ignoble and unworthy. You ask me to
      tell you if your thoughts seem strange to me, Adrienne. You forget, that
      what makes my faith in our love, is my feeling exactly as you do. What
      offends you, offends me also; what disgusts you, disgusts me. Just now,
      when you cited to me the laws of this country, which respect in a woman
      not even a mother&rsquo;s right&mdash;I thought with pride of our
      barbarous countries, where woman, though a slave, is made free when she
      becomes a mother. No, no; such laws are not made either for you or me. Is
      it not to prove your sacred respect for our love, to wish to raise it
      above the shameful servitude that would degrade it? You see, Adrienne, I
      have often heard said by the priests of my country, that there were beings
      inferior to the gods, but superior to every other creature. I did not
      believe those priests; but now I do.&rdquo; These last words were uttered,
      not in the tone of flattery, but with an accent of sincere conviction, and
      with that sort of passionate veneration and almost timid fervor, which
      mark the believer talking of his faith; but what is impossible to
      describe, is the ineffable harmony of these almost religious words, with
      the mild, deep tone of the young Oriental&rsquo;s voice&mdash;as well as
      the ardent expression of amorous melancholy, which gave an irresistible
      charm to his enchanting features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrienne had listened to Djalma with an indescribable mixture of joy,
      gratitude, and pride. Laying her hand on her bosom, as if to keep down its
      violent pulsations, she resumed, as she looked at the prince with delight:
      &ldquo;Behold him, ever the same!&mdash;just, good, great!&mdash;Oh, my
      heart! my heart! how proudly it beats. Blessed be God, who created me for
      this adored lover! He must mean to astonish the world, by the prodigies of
      tenderness and charity, that such a love may produce. They do not yet know
      the sovereign might of free, happy, ardent love. Yes, Djalma! on the day
      when our hands are joined together, what hymns of gratitude will ascend to
      heaven!&mdash;Ah! they do not know the immense, the insatiable longing for
      joy aria delight, which possesses two hearts like ours; they do not know
      what rays of happiness stream from the celestial halo of such a flame!&mdash;Oh,
      yes! I feel it. Many tears will be dried, many cold hearts warmed, at the
      divine fire of our love. And it will be by the benedictions of those we
      serve, that they will learn the intoxication of our rapture!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the dazzled eyes of Djalma, Adrienne appeared more and more an ideal
      being&mdash;partaking of the Divinity by her goodness, of the animal
      nature by passion&mdash;for, yielding to the intensity of excitement,
      Adrienne fixed upon Djalma looks that sparkled with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, almost beside himself, the Asiatic fell prostrate at the feet
      of the maiden, and exclaimed, in a supplicating voice: &ldquo;Mercy! my
      courage fails me. Have pity on me! do not talk thus. Oh, that day! what
      years of my life would I not give to hasten it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! no blasphemy. Do not your years belong to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrienne! you love me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady did not answer; but her half-veiled, burning glance, dealt
      the last blow to reason. Seizing her hands in his own, he exclaimed, with
      a tremulous voice: &ldquo;That day, in which we shall mount to heaven, in
      which we shall be gods in happiness&mdash;why postpone it any longer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because our love must be consecrated by the benediction of heaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we not free?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my love; we are free. Let us be worthy of our liberty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrienne! mercy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you also to have mercy&mdash;to have mercy on the sacredness
      of our love. Do not profane it in its very flower. Believe my heart!
      believe my presentiments! to profane it would be to kill. Courage, my
      adored lover! a few days longer&mdash;and then happiness&mdash;without
      regret, and without remorse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, until then, hell! tortures without a name! You do not, cannot
      know what I suffer when I leave your presence. Your image follows me, your
      breath burns me up; I cannot sleep, but call on you every night with sighs
      and tears&mdash;just as I called on, you, when I thought you did not love
      me&mdash;and yet I know you love me, I know you are mine. But to see you
      every day more beautiful, more adored&mdash;and every day to quit you more
      impassioned&mdash;oh! you cannot tell&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma was unable to proceed. What he said of his devouring tortures,
      Adrienne had felt, perhaps even more intensely. Electrified by the
      passionate words of Djalma, so beautiful in his excitement, her courage
      failed, and she perceived that an irresistible languor was creeping over
      her. By a last chaste effort of the will, she rose abruptly, and hastening
      to the door, which communicated with Mother Bunch&rsquo;s chamber, she
      exclaimed: &ldquo;My sister! help me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment, Mdlle. de Cardoville, her face bathed in tears, clasped
      the young sempstress in her arms; while Djalma knelt respectfully on the
      threshold he did not dare to pass.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXI. AMBITION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few days after
      the interview of Djalma and Adrienne, just described, Rodin was alone in
      his bed-chamber, in the house in the Rue de Vaugirard, walking up and down
      the room where he had so valiantly undergone the moxas of Dr. Baleinier.
      With his hands thrust into the hind-pockets of his greatcoat, and his head
      bowed upon his breast, the Jesuit seemed to be reflecting profoundly, and
      his varying walk, now slow, now quick, betrayed the agitation of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the side of Rome,&rdquo; said Rodin to himself, &ldquo;I am
      tranquil. All is going well. The abdication is as good as settled, and if
      I can pay them the price agreed, the Prince Cardinal can secure me a
      majority of nine voices in the conclave. Our General is with me; the
      doubts of Cardinal Malipieri are at an end, or have found no echo. Yet I
      am not quite easy, with regard to the reported correspondence between
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Malipieri. I have not been able to intercept
      any of it. No matter; that soldier&rsquo;s business is settled. A little
      patience and he will be wiped out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the pale lips were contracted by one of those frightful smiles, which
      gave to Rodin&rsquo;s countenance so diabolical an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, he resumed: &ldquo;The funeral of the freethinker, the
      philanthropist, the workman&rsquo;s friend, took place yesterday at St.
      Herem. Francis Hardy went off in a fit of ecstatic delirium. I had his
      donation, it is true; but this is more certain. Everything may be disputed
      in this world; the dead dispute nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin remained in thought for some moments; then he added, in a grave
      tone: &ldquo;There remain this red-haired wench and her mulatto. This is
      the twenty-seventh of May; the first of June approaches, and these turtle
      doves still seem invulnerable. The princess thought she had hit upon a
      good plan, and I should have thought so too. It was a good idea to mention
      the discovery of Agricola Baudoin in the madcap&rsquo;s room, for it made
      the Indian tiger roar with savage jealousy. Yes: but then the dove began
      to coo, and hold out her pretty beak, and the foolish tiger sheathed his
      claws, and rolled on the ground before her. It&rsquo;s a pity, for there
      was some sense in the scheme.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The walk of Rodin became more and more agitated. &ldquo;Nothing is more
      extraordinary,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;than the generative succession
      of ideas. In comparing this red-haired jade to a dove (colombe), I could
      not help thinking of that infamous old woman, Sainte-Colombe, whom that
      big rascal Jacques Dumoulin pays his court to, and whom the Abbe Corbinet
      will finish, I hope, by turning to good account. I have often remarked,
      that, as a poet may find an excellent rhyme by mere chance, so the germ of
      the best ideas is sometimes found in a word, or in some absurd resemblance
      like the present. That abominable hag, Sainte-Colombo, and the pretty
      Adrienne de Cardoville, go as well together, as a ring would suit a cat,
      or a necklace a fish. Well, there is nothing in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Rodin pronounced these words, than he started suddenly, and his
      face shone with a fatal joy. Then it assumed an expression of meditative
      astonishment, as happens when chance reveals some unexpected discovery to
      the surprised and charmed inquirer after knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, with raised head and sparkling eye, his hollow cheeks swelling with
      joy and pride, Rodin folded his arms in triumph on his breast, and
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh! how admirable and marvellous are these mysterious
      evolutions of the mind; how incomprehensible is the chain of human
      thought, which, starting from an absurd jingle of words, arrives at a
      splendid or luminous idea! Is it weakness? or is it strength? Strange&mdash;very
      strange! I compare the red-haired girl to a dove&mdash;a colombe. That
      makes me think of the hag, who traded in the bodies and souls of so many
      creatures. Vulgar proverbs occur to me, about a ring and a cat, a fish and
      a necklace&mdash;and suddenly, at the word NECKLACE, a new light dawns
      upon me. Yes: that one word NECKLACE shall be to me a golden key, to open
      the portals of my brain, so long foolishly closed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after again walking hastily up and down, Rodin continued: &ldquo;Yes,
      it is worth attempting. The more I reflect upon it, the more feasible it
      appears. Only how to get at that wretch, Saint-Colombe? Well, there is
      Jacques Dumoulin, and the other&mdash;where to find her? That is the
      stumbling-block. I must not shout before I am out of the wood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin began again to walk, biting his nails with an air of deep thought.
      For some moments, such was the tension of his mind, large drops of sweat
      stood on his yellow brow. He walked up and down, stopped, stamped with his
      foot, now raised his eyes as if in search of an inspiration, and now
      scratched his head violently with his left hand, whilst he continued to
      gnaw the nails of the right. Finally, from time to time, he uttered
      exclamations of rage, despondency, or hope, as by turns they took
      possession of his mind. If the cause of this monster&rsquo;s agitation had
      not been horrible, it would have been a curious and interesting spectacle
      to watch the labors of that powerful brain&mdash;to follow, as it were, on
      that shifting countenance, the progress and development of the project, on
      which he was now concentrating all the resources of his strong intellect.
      At length, the work appeared to be near completion, for Rodin resumed:
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! it is bold, hazardous&mdash;but then it is prompt, and
      the consequences may be incalculable. Who can foresee the effects of the
      explosion of a mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, yielding to a movement of enthusiasm, which was hardly natural to
      him, the Jesuit exclaimed, with rapture: &ldquo;Oh, the passions! the
      passions! what a magical instrument do they form, if you do but touch the
      keys with a light, skillful, and vigorous hand! How beautiful too is the
      power of thought! Talk of the acorn that becomes an oak, the seed that
      grows up to the corn&mdash;the seed takes months, the acorn centuries, to
      unfold its splendors&mdash;but here is a little word in eight letters,
      necklace and this word, falling into my brain but a few minutes ago, has
      grown and grown till it has become larger than any oak. Yes, that word is
      the germ of an idea, that, like the oak, lifts itself up towards heaven,
      for the greater glory of the Lord&mdash;such as they call Him, and such as
      I would assert Him to be, should I attain&mdash;and I shall attain&mdash;for
      these miserable Renneponts will pass away like a shadow. And what matters
      it, after all, to the moral order I am reserved to guide, whether these
      people live or die? What do such lives weigh in the balance of the great
      destinies of the world? while this inheritance which I shall boldly fling
      into the scale, will lift me to a sphere, from which one commands many
      kings, many nations&mdash;let them say and make what noise they will. The
      idiots&mdash;the stupid idiots! or rather, the kind, blessed, adorable
      idiots! They think they have crushed us, when they say to us men of the
      church: &lsquo;You take the spiritual, but we will keep the temporal!&rsquo;&mdash;Oh,
      their conscience or their modesty inspires them well, when it bids them
      not meddle with spiritual things! They abandon the spiritual! they despise
      it, they will have nothing to do with it&mdash;oh, the venerable asses!
      they do not see, that, even as they go straight to the mill, it is by the
      spiritual that we go straight to the temporal. As if the mind did not
      govern the body! They leave us the spiritual&mdash;that is, command of the
      conscience, soul, heart, and judgment&mdash;the spiritual&mdash;that is,
      the distribution of heaven&rsquo;s rewards, and punishments, and pardons&mdash;without
      check, without control, in the secrecy of the confessional&mdash;and that
      dolt, the temporal, has nothing but brute matter for his portion, and yet
      rubs his paunch for joy. Only, from time to time, he perceives, too late,
      that, if he has the body, we have the soul, and that the soul governs the
      body, and so the body ends by coming with us also&mdash;to the great
      surprise of Master Temporal, who stands staring with his hands on his
      paunch, and says: &lsquo;Dear me! is it possible?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a laugh of savage contempt, Rodin began to walk with great
      strides, and thus continued: &ldquo;Oh! let me reach it&mdash;let me but
      reach the place of SIXTUS V.&mdash;and the world shall see (one day, when
      it awakes) what it is to have the spiritual power in hands like mine&mdash;in
      the hands of a priest, who, for fifty years, has lived hardly, frugally,
      chastely, and who, were he pope, would continue to live hardly, frugally,
      chastely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin became terrible, as he spoke thus. All the sanguinary, sacrilegious,
      execrable ambition of the worst popes seemed written in fiery characters
      on the brow of this son of Ignatius. A morbid desire of rule seemed to
      stir up the Jesuit&rsquo;s impure blood; he was bathed in a burning sweat,
      and a kind of nauseous vapor spread itself round about him. Suddenly, the
      noise of a travelling-carriage, which entered the courtyard of the house,
      attracted his attention. Regretting his momentary excitement, he drew from
      his pocket his dirty white and red cotton handkerchief, and dipping it in
      a glass of water, he applied it to his cheeks and temples, while he
      approached the window, to look through the half-open blinds at the
      traveller who had just arrived. The projection of a portico, over the door
      at which the carriage had stopped, intercepted Rodin&rsquo;s view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said he, recovering his coolness: &ldquo;I shall
      know presently who is there. I must write at once to Jacques Dumoulin, to
      come hither immediately. He served me well, with regard to that little
      slut in the Rue Clovis, who made my hair stand on end with her infernal
      Beranger. This time, Dumoulin may serve me again. I have him in my
      clutches, and he will obey me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin sat down to his desk and wrote. A few seconds later, some one
      knocked at the door, which was double-locked, quite contrary to the rules
      of the order. But, sure of his own influence and importance, Rodin, who
      had obtained from the general permission to be rid for a time of the
      inconvenient company of a socius, often took upon himself to break through
      a number of the rules. A servant entered and delivered a letter to Rodin.
      Before opening it the latter said to the man: &ldquo;What carriage is that
      which just arrived?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes from Rome, father,&rdquo; answered the servant, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Rome!&rdquo; said Rodin, hastily; and in spite of himself, a
      vague uneasiness was expressed in his countenance. But, still holding the
      letter in his hands, he added: &ldquo;Who comes in the carriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reverend father of our blessed Company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his ardent curiosity, for he knew that a reverend father,
      travelling post, is always charged with some important mission, Rodin
      asked no more questions on the subject, but said, as he pointed to the
      paper in his hand: &ldquo;Whence comes this letter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From our house at St. Herem, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin looked more attentively at the writing, and recognized the hand of
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, who had been commissioned to attend M. Hardy in
      his last moments. The letter ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send a despatch to inform your reverence of a fact which is,
      perhaps, more singular than important. After the funeral of M. Francis
      Hardy, the coffin, which contained his remains, had been provisionally
      deposited in a vault beneath our chapel, until it could be removed to the
      cemetery of the neighboring town. This morning, when our people went down
      into the vault, to make the necessary preparations for the removal of the
      body&mdash;the coffin had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange indeed,&rdquo; said Rodin with a start. Then, he
      continued to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All search has hitherto been vain, to discover the authors of the
      sacrilegious deed. The chapel being, as you know, at a distance from the
      house, they were able to effect an entry without disturbing us. We have
      found traces of a four-wheeled carriage on the damp ground in the
      neighborhood; but, at some little distance from the chapel, these marks
      are lost in the sand, and it has been impossible to follow them any
      farther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can have carried away this body?&rdquo; said Rodin, with a
      thoughtful air. &ldquo;Who could have any interest in doing so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily, the certificate of death is quite correct. I sent for a
      doctor from Etampes, to prove the disease, and no question can be raised
      on that point. The donation is therefore good and valid in every respect,
      but I think it best to inform your reverence of what has happened, that
      you may take measures accordingly, etc., etc.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Rodin said to himself: &ldquo;D&rsquo;Aigrigny
      is right in his remark; it is more singular than important. Still, it
      makes one think. We must have an eye to this affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning towards the servant, who had brought him the letter, Rodin gave
      him the note he had just written to Ninny Moulin, and said to him: &ldquo;Let
      this letter be taken instantly to its address, and let the bearer wait for
      an answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment the servant left the room, a reverend father entered, and
      said to Rodin, &ldquo;Father Caboccini of Rome has just arrived, with a
      mission from our general to your reverence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, Rodin&rsquo;s blood ran cold, but he maintained his
      immovable calmness, and said simply: &ldquo;Where is Father Caboccini?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the next room, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg him to walk in, and leave us,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second after, Father Caboccini of Rome entered the room and was left
      alone with Rodin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXII. TO A SOCIUS, A SOCIUS AND A HALF.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Reverend Father
      Caboccini, the Roman Jesuit who now came to visit Rodin, was a short man
      of about thirty years of age, plump, in good condition, and with an
      abdomen that swelled out his black cassock. The good little father was
      blind with one eye, but his remaining organ of vision sparkled with
      vivacity. His rosy countenance was gay, smiling, joyous, splendidly
      crowned with thick chestnut hair, which curled like a wax doll&rsquo;s.
      His address was cordial to familiarity, and his expansive and petulant
      manners harmonized well with his general appearance. In a second, Rodin
      had taken his measure of the Italian emissary; and as he knew the practice
      of his Company, and the ways of Rome, he felt by no means comfortable at
      sight of this jolly little father, with such affable manners. He would
      have less feared some tall, bony priest, with austere and sepulchral
      countenance, for he knew that the Company loves to deceive by the outward
      appearance of its agents; and if Rodin guessed rightly, the cordial
      address of this personage would rather tend to show that he was charged
      with some fatal mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspicious, attentive, with eye and mind on the watch, like an old wolf,
      expecting an attack, Rodin advanced as usual, slowly and tortuously
      towards the little man, so as to have time to examine him thoroughly, and
      penetrate beneath his jovial outside. But the Roman left him no space for
      that purpose. In his impetuous affection he threw himself right on the
      neck of Rodin, pressed him in his arms with an effusion of tenderness, and
      kissed him over and over again upon both cheeks, so loudly and plentifully
      that the echo resounded through the apartment. In his life Rodin had never
      been so treated. More and more uneasy at the treachery which must needs
      lurk under such warm embraces, and irritated by his own evil
      presentiments, the French Jesuit did, all he could to extricate himself
      from the Roman&rsquo;s exaggerated tokens of tenderness. But the latter
      kept his hold; his arms, though short, were vigorous, and Rodin was kissed
      over and over again, till the little one-eyed man was quite out of breath.
      It is hardly necessary to state that these embraces were accompanied by
      the most friendly, affectionate, and fraternal exclamations&mdash;all in
      tolerably good French, but with a strong Italian accent, which we muss beg
      the reader to supply for himself, after we have given a single specimen.
      It will perhaps be remembered that, fully aware of the danger he might
      possibly incur by his ambitious machinations, and knowing from history
      that the use of poison had often been considered at Rome as a state
      necessity, Rodin, on being suddenly attacked with the cholera, had
      exclaimed, with a furious glance at Cardinal Malipieri, &ldquo;I am
      poisoned!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same apprehensions occurred involuntarily to the Jesuit&rsquo;s mind
      as he tried, by useless efforts, to escape from the embraces of the
      Italian emissary; and he could not help muttering to himself, &ldquo;This
      one-eyed fellow is a great deal too fond. I hope there is no poison under
      his Judas-kisses.&rdquo; At last, little Father Caboccini, being quite out
      of breath, was obliged to relinquish his hold on Rodin&rsquo;s neck, who,
      readjusting his dirty collar, and his old cravat and waistcoat, somewhat
      in disorder in consequence of this hurricane of caresses, said in a gruff
      tone, &ldquo;Your humble servant, father, but you need not kiss quite so
      hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without making any answer to this reproach, the little father riveted his
      one eye upon Rodin with an expression of enthusiasm, and exclaimed, whilst
      he accompanied his words with petulant gestures, &ldquo;At lazt I zee te
      zuperb light of our zacred Company, and can zalute him from my heart&mdash;vonse
      more, vonse more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As the little father had already recovered his breath, and was about to
      rush once again into Rodin&rsquo;s arms, the latter stepped back hastily,
      and held out his arm to keep him off, saying, in allusion to the illogical
      metaphor employed by Father Caboccini, &ldquo;First of all, father, one
      does not embrace a light&mdash;and then I am not a light&mdash;I am a
      humble and obscure laborer in the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman replied with enthusiasm (we shall henceforth translate his
      gibberish), &ldquo;You are right, father, we cannot embrace a light, but
      we can prostrate ourselves before it, and admire its dazzling brightness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Caboccini was about to suit the action to the word, and to
      prostrate himself before Rodin, had not the latter prevented this mode of
      adulation by seizing the Roman by the arm and exclaiming, &ldquo;This is
      mere idolatry, father. Pass over my qualities, and tell me what is the
      object of your journey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The object, my dear father, fills me with joy and happiness. I have
      endeavored to show you my affection by my caresses, for my heart is
      overflowing. I have hardly been able to restrain myself during my journey
      hither, for my heart rushed to meet you. The object transports, delights,
      enchants me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what enchants you?&rdquo; cried Rodin, exasperated by these
      Italian exaggerations. &ldquo;What is the object?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This rescript of our very reverend and excellent General will
      inform you, my clear father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Caboccini drew from his pocket-book a folded paper, with three seals,
      which he kissed respectfully, and delivered to Rodin, who himself kissed
      it in his turn, and opened it with visible anxiety. While he read it the
      countenance of the Jesuit remained impassible, but the pulsation of the
      arteries on his temples announced his internal agitation. Yet he put the
      letter coolly into his pocket, and looking at the Roman, said to him,
      &ldquo;Be it as our excellent General has commanded!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father,&rdquo; cried Caboccini, with a new effusion of
      tenderness and admiration, &ldquo;I shall be the shadow of your light,
      and, in fact, your second self. I shall have the happiness of being always
      with you, day and night, and of acting as your socius, since, after having
      allowed you to be without one for some time, according to your wish, and
      for the interest of our blessed Company, our excellent General now thinks
      fit to send me from Rome, to fill that post about your person&mdash;an
      unexpected, an immense favor, which fills me with gratitude to our
      General, and with love to you, my dear, my excellent father!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well played,&rdquo; thought Rodin; &ldquo;but I am not so
      soft, and &lsquo;tis only among the blind that your Cyclops are kings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the day in which this scene took place between the Jesuit
      and his new socius, Ninny Moulin, after receiving in presence of Caboccini
      the instructions of Rodin, went straight to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman had made her fortune, at the time of the allies taking Paris,
      by keeping one of those &ldquo;pretty milliner&rsquo;s shops,&rdquo; whose
      &ldquo;pink bonnets&rdquo; have run into a proverb not extinct in these
      days when bonnets are not known. Ninny Moulin had no better well to draw
      inspiration from when, as now, he had to find out, as per Rodin&rsquo;s
      order, a girl of an age and appearance which, singularly enough, were
      closely resembling those of Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt of Ninny Moulin&rsquo;s success in this mission, for the next
      morning Rodin, whose countenance wore a triumphant expression, put with
      his own hand a letter into the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was addressed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To M. Agricola Baudoin, &ldquo;No. 2, Rue Brise-Miche, &ldquo;Paris.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIII. FARINGHEA&rsquo;S AFFECTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t will, perhaps,
      be remembered that Djalma, when he heard for the first time that he was
      beloved by Adrienne, had, in the fulness of his joy, spoken thus to
      Faringhea, whose treachery he had just discovered, &ldquo;You leagued with
      my enemies, and I had done you no harm. You are wicked, because you are no
      doubt unhappy. I will strive to make you happy, so that you may be good.
      Would you have gold?&mdash;you shall have it. Would you have a friend?&mdash;though
      you are a slave, a king&rsquo;s son offers you his friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea had refused the gold, and appeared to accept the friendship of
      the son of Kadja-sing. Endowed with remarkable intelligence, and
      extraordinary power of dissimulation the half-breed had easily persuaded
      the prince of the sincerity of his repentance, and obtained credit for his
      gratitude and attachment from so confiding and generous a character.
      Besides, what motives could Djalma have to suspect the slave, now become
      his friend? Certain of the love of Mdlle. de Cardoville, with whom he
      passed a portion of every day, her salutary influence would have guarded
      him against any dangerous counsels or calumnies of the half-caste, a
      faithful and secret instrument of Rodin, and attached by him to the
      Company. But Faringhea, whose tact was amazing, did not act so lightly; he
      never spoke to the prince of Mdlle. de Cardoville, and waited
      unobtrusively for the confidential communications into which Djalma was
      sometimes hurried by his excessive joy. A few days after the interview
      last described between Adrienne and Djalma, and on the morrow of the day
      when Rodin, certain of the success of Ninny Moulin&rsquo;s mission to
      Sainte Colombe, had himself put a letter in the post to the address of
      Agricola Baudoin, the half-caste, who for some time had appeared oppressed
      with a violent grief, seemed to get so much worse, that the prince, struck
      with the desponding air of the man, asked him kindly and repeatedly the
      cause of his sorrow. But Faringhea, while he gratefully thanked the prince
      for the interest he took in him, maintained the most absolute silence and
      reserve on the subject of his grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preliminaries will enable the reader to understand the following
      scene, which took place about noon in the house in the Rue de Clichy
      occupied by the Hindoo. Contrary to his habit, Djalma had not passed that
      morning with Adrienne. He had been informed the evening before, by the
      young lady, that she must ask of him the sacrifice of this whole day, to
      take the necessary measures to make their marriage sacred and acceptable
      in the eyes of the world, and yet free from the restrictions which she and
      Djalma disapproved. As for the means to be employed by Mdlle. de
      Cardoville to attain this end, and the name of the pure and honorable
      person who was to consecrate their union, these were secrets which, not
      belonging exclusively to the young lady, could not yet be communicated to
      Djalma. To the Indian, so long accustomed to devote every instant to
      Adrienne, this day seemed interminable. By turns a prey to the most
      burning agitation, and to a kind of stupor, in which he plunged himself to
      escape from the thoughts that caused his tortures, Djalma lay stretched
      upon a divan, with his face buried in his hands, as if to shut out the
      view of a too enchanting vision. Suddenly, without knocking at the door,
      as usual, Faringhea entered the prince&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the noise the half-caste made in entering Djalma started, raised his
      head, and looked round him with surprise; but, on seeing the pale agitated
      countenance of the slave, he rose hastily, and advancing towards him,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;What is the matter, Faringhea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, and as if struggling with a painful
      feeling of hesitation, Faringhea threw himself at the feet of Djalma, and
      murmured in a weak, despairing, almost supplicating voice: &ldquo;I am
      very miserable. Pity me, my good lord!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was so touching, the grief under which the half-breed suffered
      seemed to give to his features, generally fixed and hard as bronze, such a
      heart-rending expression, that Djalma was deeply affected, and, bending to
      raise him from the ground, said to him, in a kindly voice: &ldquo;Speak to
      me! Confidence appeases the torments of the heart. Trust me, friend&mdash;for
      my angel herself said to me, that happy love cannot bear to see tears
      about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But unhappy love, miserable love, betrayed love&mdash;weeps tears
      of blood,&rdquo; replied Faringhea, with painful dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what love dost thou speak?&rdquo; asked Djalma, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak of my love,&rdquo; answered the half-caste, with a gloomy
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your love?&rdquo; said Djalma, more and more astonished; not
      that the half caste, still young, and with a countenance of sombre beauty,
      appeared to him incapable of inspiring or feeling the tender passion, but
      that, until now, he had never imagined him capable of conceiving so deep a
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; resumed the half-caste, &ldquo;you told me, that
      misfortune had made me wicked, and that happiness would make me good. In
      those words, I saw a presentiment, and a noble love entered my heart, at
      the moment when hatred and treachery departed from it. I, the half-savage,
      found a woman, beautiful and young, to respond to my passion. At least I
      thought so. But I had betrayed you, my lord, and there is no happiness for
      a traitor, even though he repent. In my turn, I have been shamefully
      betrayed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seeing the surprise of the prince, the half-caste added, as if
      overwhelmed with confusion: &ldquo;Do not mock me, my lord! The most
      frightful tortures would not have wrung this confession from me; but you,
      the son of a king, deigned to call the poor slave your friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your friend thanks you for the confidence,&rdquo; answered
      Djalma. &ldquo;Far from mocking, he will console you. Mock you! do you
      think it possible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betrayed love merits contempt and insult,&rdquo; said Faringhea,
      bitterly. &ldquo;Even cowards may point at one with scorn&mdash;for, in
      this country, the sight of the man deceived in what is dearest to his
      soul, the very life blood of his life, only makes people shrug their
      shoulders and laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you certain of this treachery?&rdquo; said Djalma, mildly.
      Then he added, with visible hesitation, that proved the goodness of his
      heart: &ldquo;Listen to me, and forgive me for speaking of the past! It
      will only be another proof, that I cherish no evil memories, and that I
      fully believe in your repentance and affection. Remember, that I also once
      thought, that she, who is the angel of my life, did not love me&mdash;and
      yet it was false. Who tells you, that you are not, like me, deceived by
      false appearances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my lord! could I only believe so! But I dare not hope it. My
      brain wanders uncertain, I cannot come to any resolution, and therefore I
      have recourse to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what causes your suspicions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her coldness, which sometimes succeeds to apparent tenderness. The
      refusals she gives me in the name of duty. Yes,&rdquo; added the
      half-caste, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;she reasons about her
      love&mdash;a proof, that she has never loved me, or that she loves me no
      more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, she perhaps loves you all the more, that she takes
      into consideration the interest and the dignity of her love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30437m.jpg" alt="30437m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30437.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what they all say,&rdquo; replied the half-caste, with
      bitter irony, as he fixed a penetrating look on Djalma; &ldquo;thus speak
      all those who love weakly, coldly; but those who love valiantly, never
      show these insulting suspicions. For them, a word from the man they adore
      is a command; they do not haggle and bargain, for the cruel pleasure of
      exciting the passion of their lover to madness, and so ruling him more
      surely. No, what their lover asks of them, were it to cost life and honor,
      they would grant it without hesitation&mdash;because, with them, the will
      of the man they love is above every other consideration, divine and human.
      But those crafty women, whose pride it is to tame and conquer man&mdash;who
      take delight in irritating his passion, and sometimes appear on the point
      of yielding to it&mdash;are demons, who rejoice in the tears and torments
      of the wretch, that loves them with the miserable weakness of a child.
      While we expire with love at their feet, the perfidious creatures are
      calculating the effects of their refusals, and seeing how far they can go,
      without quite driving their victim to despair. Oh! how cold and cowardly
      are they, compared to the valiant, true-hearted women, who say to the men
      of their choice: &lsquo;Let me be thine to-day-and to-morrow, come shame,
      despair, and death&mdash;it matters little! Be happy! my life is not worth
      one tear of thine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma&rsquo;s brow had darkened, as he listened. Having kept inviolable
      the secret of the various incidents of his passion for Mdlle. de
      Cardoville, he could not but see in these words a quite involuntary
      allusion to the delays and refusals of Adrienne. And yet Djalma suffered a
      moment in his pride, at the thought of considerations and duties, that a
      woman holds dearer than her love. But this bitter and painful thought was
      soon effaced from the oriental&rsquo;s mind, thanks to the beneficent
      influence of the remembrance of Adrienne. His brow again cleared, and he
      answered the half-caste, who was watching him attentively with a sidelong
      glance: &ldquo;You are deluded by grief. If you have no other reason to
      doubt her you love, than these refusals and vague suspicions, be
      satisfied! You are perhaps loved better than you can imagine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! would it were so, my lord!&rdquo; replied the half-caste,
      dejectedly, as if he had been deeply touched by the words of Djalma.
      &ldquo;Yet I say to myself: There is for this woman something stronger
      than her love&mdash;delicacy, dignity, honor, what you will&mdash;but she
      does not love me enough to sacrifice for me this something!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, you are deceived,&rdquo; answered Djalma, mildly, though
      the words affected him with a painful impression. &ldquo;The greater the
      love of a woman, the more it should be chaste and noble. It is love itself
      that awakens this delicacy and these scruples. He rules, instead of being
      ruled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied the half-caste, with bitter irony,
      &ldquo;Love so rules me, that this woman bids me love in her own fashion,
      and I have only to submit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing suddenly, Faringhea hid his face in his hands, and heaved a deep
      drawn sigh. His features expressed a mixture of hate, rage, and despair,
      at once so terrible and so painful, that Djalma, more and more affected,
      exclaimed, as he seized the other&rsquo;s hand: &ldquo;Calm this fury, and
      listen to the voice of friendship! It will disperse this evil influence.
      Speak to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! it is too dreadful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, I bid thee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! leave the wretch to his despair!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think me capable of that?&rdquo; said Djalma, with a mixture
      of mildness and dignity, which seemed to make an impression on the half
      caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied he, hesitating; &ldquo;do you wish to hear
      more, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to hear all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! I have not told you all&mdash;for, at the moment of
      making this confession, shame and the fear of ridicule kept me back. You
      asked me what reason I had to believe myself betrayed. I spoke to you of
      vague suspicions, refusals, coldness. That is not all&mdash;this evening&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening&mdash;she made an appointment&mdash;with a man that
      she prefers to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger who pitied my blindness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose the man deceived you&mdash;or deceives himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has offered me proofs of what he advances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proofs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will enable me this evening to witness the interview. &lsquo;It
      may be,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that this appointment may have no guilt in
      it, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary. Judge for yourself, have
      courage, and your cruel indecision will be at an end.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my lord. My head wandered as it does now and I came to you
      for advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, making a gesture of despair, he proceeded with a savage laugh:
      &ldquo;Advice? It is from the blade of my kand-jiar that I should ask
      counsel! It would answer: &lsquo;Blood! blood!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea grasped convulsively the long dagger attached to his girdle.
      There is a sort of contagion in certain forms of passion. At sight of
      Faringhea&rsquo;s countenance, agitated by jealous fury, Djalma shuddered&mdash;for
      he remembered the fit of insane rage, with which he had been possessed,
      when the Princess de Saint-Dizier had defied Adrienne to contradict her,
      as to the discovery of Agricola Baudoin in her bed-chamber. But then,
      reassured by the lady&rsquo;s proud and noble bearing, Djalma had soon
      learned to despise the horrible calumny, which Adrienne had not even
      thought worthy of an answer. Still, two or three times, as the lightning
      will flash suddenly across the clearest sky, the remembrance of that
      shameful accusation had crossed the prince&rsquo;s mind, like a streak of
      fire, but had almost instantly vanished, in the serenity and happiness of
      his ineffable confidence in Adrienne&rsquo;s heart. These memories,
      however, whilst they saddened the mind of Djalma, only made him more
      compassionate with regard to Faringhea, than he might have been without
      this strange coincidence between the position of the half-caste and his
      own. Knowing, by his own experience, to what madness a blind fury may be
      carried, and wishing to tame the half-caste by affectionate kindness,
      Djalma said to him in a grave and mild tone: &ldquo;I offered you my
      friendship. I will now act towards you a friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Faringhea, seemingly a prey to a dull and mute frenzy, stood with
      fixed and haggard eyes, as though he did not hear Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter laid his hand on his shoulder, and resumed: &ldquo;Faringhea,
      listen to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the half-caste, starting abruptly, as from a
      dream, &ldquo;forgive me&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the anguish occasioned by these cruel suspicions, it is not of
      your kandjiar that you must take counsel&mdash;but of your friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To this interview, which will prove the innocence or the treachery
      of your beloved, you will do well to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said the half-caste, in a hollow voice, and with a
      bitter smile: &ldquo;I shall be there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must not go alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, my lord?&rdquo; cried the half-caste. &ldquo;Who
      will accompany me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my lord?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps, to save you from a crime&mdash;for I know how
      blind and unjust is the earliest outburst of rage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that transport gives us revenge!&rdquo; cried the half-caste,
      with a cruel smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faringhea, this day is all my own. I shall not leave you,&rdquo;
      said the prince, resolutely. &ldquo;Either you shall not go to this
      interview, or I will accompany you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-caste appeared conquered by this generous perseverance. He fell
      at the feet of Djalma, pressed the prince&rsquo;s hand respectfully to his
      forehead and to his lips, and said: &ldquo;My lord, be generous to the
      end! forgive me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what should I forgive you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I spoke to you, I had the audacity to think of asking for
      what you have just freely offered. Not knowing to what extent my fury
      might carry me, I had thought of asking you this favor, which you would
      not perhaps grant to an equal, but I did not dare to do it. I shrunk even
      from the avowal of the treachery I have cause to fear, and I came only to
      tell you of my misery&mdash;because to you alone in all the world I could
      tell it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the almost candid simplicity, with which the
      half-breed pronounced these words, and the soft tones, mingled with tears,
      which had succeeded his savage fury. Deeply affected, Djalma raised him
      from the ground, and said: &ldquo;You were entitled to ask of me a mark of
      friendship. I am happy in having forestalled you. Courage! be of good
      cheer! I will accompany you to this interview, and if my hopes do not
      deceive me, you will find you have been deluded by false appearances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the night was come, the half-breed and Djalma, wrapped in their
      cloaks, got into a hackney-coach. Faringhea ordered the coachman to drive
      to the house inhabited by Sainte-Colombe.

      CHAPTER LXIV. AN EVENING AT SAINTE-COLOMBE&rsquo;S.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>eaving Djalma and
      Faringhea in the coach, on their way, a few words are indispensable before
      continuing this scene. Ninny Moulin, ignorant of the real object of the
      step he took at the instigation of Rodin, had, on the evening before,
      according to orders received from the latter, offered a considerable sum
      to Sainte-Colombe, to obtain from that creature (still singularly
      rapacious) the use of her apartments for whole day. Sainte-Colombe, having
      accepted this proposition, too advantageous to be refused, had set out
      that morning with her servants, to whom she wished, she said, in return
      for their good services, to give a day&rsquo;s pleasure in the country.
      Master of the house, Rodin, in a black wig, blue spectacles, and a cloak,
      and with his mouth and chin buried in a worsted comforter&mdash;in a word,
      perfectly disguised&mdash;had gone that morning to take a look at the
      apartments, and to give his instructions to the half-caste. The latter, in
      two hours from the departure of the Jesuit, had, thanks to his address and
      intelligence, completed the most important preparation and returned in
      haste to Djalma, to play with detestable hypocrisy the scene at which we
      have just been present.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ride from the Rue de Clichy to the Rue de Richelieu, Faringhea
      appeared plunged in a mournful reverie. Suddenly, he said to Djalma to a
      quick tone: &ldquo;My lord, if I am betrayed, I must have vengeance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contempt is a terrible revenge,&rdquo; answered Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the half-caste, with an accent of repressed
      rage. &ldquo;It is not enough. The nearer the moment approaches, the more
      I feel I must have blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, have pity on me! I was a coward to draw back from my
      revenge. Let me leave you, my lord! I will go alone to this interview.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Faringhea made a movement, as if he would spring from the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma held him by the arm, and said: &ldquo;Remain! I wilt not leave you.
      If you are betrayed, you shall not shed blood. Contempt will avenge and
      friendship will console you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my lord; I am resolved. When I have killed&mdash;then I
      will kill myself,&rdquo; cried the half-caste, with savage excitement.
      &ldquo;This kandjiar for the false ones!&rdquo; added he, laying his hand
      on his dagger. &ldquo;The poison in the hilt for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faringhea&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I resist you, my lord, forgive me! My destiny must be
      accomplished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Time pressed, and Djalma, despairing to calm the other&rsquo;s ferocious
      rage, resolved to have recourse to a stratagem.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes&rsquo; silence, he said to Faringhea: &ldquo;I will not
      leave you. I will do all I can to save you from a crime. If I do not
      succeed, the blood you shed be on your own head. This hand shall never
      again be locked in yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words appeared to make a deep impression on Faringhea. He breathed a
      long sigh, and, bowing his head upon his breast, remained silent and full
      of thought. Djalma prepared, by the faint light of the lamps, reflected in
      the interior of the coach, to throw himself suddenly on the half-caste,
      and disarm him. But the latter, who saw at a glance the intention of the
      prince, drew his kandjiar abruptly from his girdle, and holding it still
      in its sheath, said to the prince in a half-solemn, half-savage tone:
      &ldquo;This dagger, in a strong hand, is terrible; and in this phial is
      one of the most subtle poisons of our country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched a spring, and the knob at the top of the hilt rose like a lid,
      discovering the mouth of a small crystal phial concealed in this murderous
      weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three drops of this poison upon the lips,&rdquo; resumed the
      half caste, &ldquo;and death comes slowly and peacefully, in a few hours,
      and without pain. Only, for the first symptom, the nails turn blue. But he
      who emptied this phial at a draught would fall dead, as if struck by
      lightning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Djalma; &ldquo;I know that our country produces
      such mysterious poisons. But why lay such stress on the murderous
      properties of this weapon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To show you, my lord, that this kandjiar would ensure the success
      and impunity of my vengeance. With the blade I could destroy, and by the
      poison escape from human justice. Well, my lord! this kandjiar&mdash;take
      it&mdash;I give it up to you&mdash;I renounce my vengeance&mdash;rather
      than render myself unworthy to clasp again your hand!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He presented the dagger to the prince, who, as pleased as surprised at
      this unexpected determination, hastily secured the terrible weapon beneath
      his own girdle; whilst the half-breed continued, in a voice of emotion:
      &ldquo;Deep this kandjiar, my lord&mdash;and when you have seen and heard
      all that we go to hear and see&mdash;you shall either give me the dagger
      to strike a wretch&mdash;or the poison, to die without striking. You shall
      command; I will obey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma was about to reply, when the coach stopped at the house inhabited
      by Sainte-Colombe. The prince and the half-caste, well enveloped in their
      mantles, entered a dark porch, and the door was closed after them.
      Faringhea exchanged a few words with the porter, and the latter gave him a
      key. The two Orientals soon arrived at Sainte-Colombe&rsquo;s apartments,
      which had two doors opening upon the landing-place, besides a private
      entrance from the courtyard. As he put the key into the lock, Faringhea
      said to Djalma, in an agitated voice: &ldquo;Pity my weakness, my lord&mdash;but,
      at this terrible moment, I tremble and hesitate. It were perhaps better to
      doubt&mdash;or to forget!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the prince was about to answer, the half-caste exclaimed: &ldquo;No!
      we must have no cowardice!&rdquo; and, opening the door precipitately, he
      entered, followed by Djalma.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was again closed, the prince and the half-caste found
      themselves in a dark and narrow passage. &ldquo;Your hand, my lord&mdash;let
      me guide you&mdash;walk lightly,&rdquo; said Faringhea, in a low whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He extended his hand to the prince, who took hold of it, and they both
      advanced silently through the darkness. After leading Djalma some
      distance, and opening and closing several doors, the half-caste stopped
      abruptly, and abandoning the hand which he had hitherto held, said to the
      prince: &ldquo;My lord, the decisive moment approaches; let us wait here
      for a few seconds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence followed these words of the half-caste. The darkness
      was so complete, that Djalma could distinguish nothing. In about a minute,
      he heard Faringhea moving away from him; and then a door was suddenly
      opened, and as abruptly closed and locked. This circumstance made Djalma
      somewhat uneasy. By a mechanical movement, he laid his hand upon his
      dagger, and advanced cautiously towards the side, where he supposed the
      door to be.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30445m.jpg" alt="30445m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30445.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the half-caste&rsquo;s voice struck upon his ear, though it was
      impossible to guess whence it came. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; it said,
      &ldquo;you told me, you were my friend. I act as a friend. If I have
      employed stratagem to bring you hither, it is because the blindness of
      your fatal passion would otherwise have prevented your accompanying me.
      The Princess de Saint Dizier named to you Agricola Baudoin, the lover of
      Adrienne de Cardoville. Listen&mdash;look&mdash;judge!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice ceased. It appeared to have issued from one corner of the room.
      Djalma, still in darkness, perceived too late into what a snare he had
      fallen, and trembled with rage&mdash;almost with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faringhea!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;where am I? where are you?
      Open the door on your life! I would leave this place instantly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Extending his arms, the prince advanced hastily several steps, but he only
      touched a tapestried wall; he followed it, hoping to find the door, and he
      at length found it; but it was locked, and resisted all his efforts. He
      continued his researches, and came to a fireplace with no fire in it, and
      to a second door, equally fast. In a few moments, he had thus made the
      circle of the room, and found himself again at the fireplace. The anxiety
      of the prince increased more and more. He called Faringhea, in a voice
      trembling with passion. There was no answer. Profound silence reigned
      without, and complete darkness within. Ere long, a perfumed vapor, of
      indescribable sweetness, but very subtle and penetrating, spread itself
      insensibly through the little room in which Djalma was. It might be, that
      the orifice of a tube, passing through one of the doors of the room,
      introduced this balmy current. At the height of angry and terrible
      thoughts, Djalma paid no attention to this odor&mdash;but soon the
      arteries of his temples began to beat violently, a burning heat seemed to
      circulate rapidly through his veins, he felt a sensation of pleasure, his
      resentment died gradually away, and a mild, ineffable torpor crept over
      him, without his being fully conscious of the mental transformation that
      was taking place. Yet, by a last effort of the wavering will, Djalma
      advanced once more to try and open one of the doors; he found it indeed,
      but at this place the vapor was so strong, that its action redoubled, and,
      unable to move a step further, Djalma was obliged to support himself by
      leaning against the wall.(43)
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a strange thing happened. A faint light spread itself gradually
      through an adjoining apartment, and Djalma now perceived, for the first
      time, the existence of a little round window, in the wall of the room in
      which he was. On the side of the prince, this opening was protected by a
      slight but strong railing, which hardly intercepted the view. On the other
      side a thick piece of plate-glass was fixed at the distance of two or
      three inches from the railing in question. The room, which Djalma saw
      through this window, and through which the faint light was now gradually
      spreading, was richly furnished. Between two windows, hung with crimson
      silk curtains, stood a kind of wardrobe, with a looking-glass front;
      opposite the fireplace in which glowed the burning coals, was a long, wide
      divan, furnished with cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another second a woman entered this apartment. Her face and figure were
      invisible, being wrapped in a long, hooded mantle, of peculiar form, and a
      dark color. The sight of this mantle made Djalma start. To the pleasure he
      at first felt succeeded a feverish anxiety, like the growing fumes of
      intoxication. There was that strange buzzing in his ears which we
      experience when we plunge into deep waters. It was in a kind of delirium
      that Djalma looked on at what was passing in the next room. The woman who
      had just appeared entered with caution, almost with fear. Drawing aside
      one of the window curtains, she glanced through the closed blinds into the
      street. Then she returned slowly to the fireplace, where she stood for a
      moment pensive, still carefully enveloped in her mantle. Completely
      yielding to the influence of the vapor, which deprived him of his presence
      of mind&mdash;forgetting Faringhea, and all the circumstances that had
      accompanied his arrival at this house&mdash;Djalma concentrated all the
      powers of his attention on the spectacle before him, at which he seemed to
      be present as in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Djalma saw the woman leave the fireplace and advance towards the
      looking-glass. Turning her face toward it, she allowed the mantle to glide
      down to her feet. Djalma was thunderstruck. He saw the face of Adrienne de
      Cardoville. Yes, Adrienne, as he had seen her the night before, attired as
      during her interview with the Princess de Saint Dizier&mdash;the light
      green dress, the rose-colored ribbons, the white head ornaments. A network
      of white beads concealed her back hair, and harmonized admirably with the
      shining gold of her ringlets. Finally, as far as the Hindoo could judge
      through the railing and the thick glass, and in the faint light, it was
      the figure of Adrienne, with her marble shoulders and swan-like neck, so
      proud and so graceful. In a word, he could not, he did not doubt that it
      was Adrienne de Cardoville. Djalma was bathed in a burning dew, his dizzy
      excitement increased, and, with bloodshot eye and heaving bosom, he
      remained motionless, gazing almost without the power of thought. The young
      lady, with her back still turned towards Djalma, arranged her hair with
      graceful art, took off the network which formed her head-dress, placed it
      on the chimney-piece, and began to unfasten her gown; then, withdrawing
      from the looking-glass, she disappeared for an instant from Djalma&rsquo;s
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is expecting Agricola Baudoin, her lover,&rdquo; said a voice,
      which seemed to proceed from the wall of the dark room in which Djalma
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his bewilderment, these terrible words, &ldquo;She is
      expecting Agricola Baudoin, her lover,&rdquo; passed like a stream of fire
      through the brain and heart of the prince. A cloud of blood came over his
      eyes, he uttered a hollow moan, which the thickness of the glass prevented
      from being heard in the next room, and broke his nails in attempting to
      tear down the iron railing before the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached this paroxysm of delirious rage, Djalma saw the uncertain
      light grow still fainter, as if it had been discreetly obscured, and,
      through the vapory shadow that hung before him, he perceived the young
      lady returning, clad in a long white dressing-gown, and with her golden
      curls floating over her naked arms and shoulders. She advanced cautiously
      in the direction of a door which was hid from Djalma&rsquo;s view. At this
      moment, one of the doors of the apartment in which the prince was
      concealed was gently opened by an invisible hand. Djalma noticed it by the
      click of the lock, and by the current of fresh air which streamed upon his
      face, for he could see nothing. This door, left open for Djalma, like that
      in the next room, to which the young lady had drawn near, led to a sort of
      ante-chamber communicating with the stairs, which some one now rapidly
      ascended, and, stopping short, knocked twice at the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes Agricola Baudoin. Look and listen!&rdquo; said the same
      voice that the prince had already heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mad, intoxicated, but with the fixed idea and reckless determination of a
      madman or a drunkard, Djalma drew the dagger which Faringhea had left in
      his possession, and stood in motionless expectation. Hardly were the two
      knocks heard before the young lady quitted the apartment, from which
      streamed a faint ray of light, ran to the door of the staircase, so that
      some faint glimmer reached the place where Djalma stood watching, his
      dagger in his hand. He saw the young lady pass across the ante-chamber,
      and approach the door of the staircase, where she said in a whisper:
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Agricola Baudoin,&rdquo; answered, from, without, a
      manly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      What followed was rapid as lightning, and must be conceived rather than
      described. Hardly had the young lady drawn the bolt of the door, hardly
      had Agricola Baudoin stepped across the threshold, than Djalma, with the
      bound of a tiger, stabbed as it were at once, so rapid were the strokes,
      both the young lady, who fell dead on the floor, and Agricola, who sank,
      dangerously wounded, by the side of the unfortunate victim. This scene of
      murder, rapid as thought, took place in the midst of a half obscurity.
      Suddenly the faint light from the chamber was completely extinguished, and
      a second after, Djalma felt his arm seized in the darkness by an iron
      grasp, and the voice of Faringhea whispered: &ldquo;You are avenged. Come;
      we can secure our retreat.&rdquo; Inert, stupefied at what he had done,
      Djalma offered no resistance, and let himself be dragged by the half-caste
      into the inner apartment, from which there was another way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rodin had exclaimed, in his admiration of the generative power of
      thought, that the word NECKLACE had been the germ of the infernal project
      he then contemplated, it was, that chance had brought to his mind the
      remembrance of the too famous affair of the diamond necklace, in which a
      woman, thanks to her vague resemblance to Queen Marie Antoinette, being
      dressed like that princess, and favored by the uncertainty of a twilight,
      had played so skillfully the part of her unfortunate sovereign, as to make
      the Cardinal Prince de Rohan, though familiar with the court, the complete
      dupe of the illusion. Having once determined on his execrable design,
      Rodin had sent Jacques Dumoulin to Sainte-Colombe, without telling him the
      real object of his mission, to ask this experienced woman to procure a
      fine young girl, tall, and with red hair. Once found, a costume exactly
      resembling that worn by Adrienne, and of which the Princess de
      Saint-Dizier gave the description to Rodin (though herself ignorant of
      this new plot), was to complete the deception. The rest is known, or may
      be guessed. The unfortunate girl, who acted as Adrienne&rsquo;s double,
      believed she was only aiding in a jest. As for Agricola, he had received a
      letter, in which he was invited to a meeting that might be of the greatest
      importance to Mdlle. de Cardoville.
    </p>

      (43) See the strange effect of hasheesh. To the effect of this is
      attributed the kind of hallucination which seized on those unhappy
      persons, whom the Prince of the Assassins (the Old Man of the Mountain)
      used as the instruments of his vengeance.

      CHAPTER LXV. THE NUPTIAL BED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he mild light of a
      circular lamp of oriental alabaster, suspended from the ceiling by three
      silver chains, spreads a faint lustre through the bed-chamber of Adrienne
      de Cardoville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large ivory bedstead, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, is not at present
      occupied, and almost disappears beneath snowy curtains of lace and muslin,
      transparent and vapory as clouds. On the white marble mantlepiece, from
      beneath which the fire throws ruddy beams on the ermine carpet, is the
      usual basket filled with a bush of red camellias, in the midst of their
      shining green leaves. A pleasant aromatic odor, rising from a warm and
      perfumed bath in the next room, penetrates every corner of the
      bed-chamber. All without is calm and silent. It is hardly eleven o&rsquo;clock.
      The ivory door, opposite to that which leads to the bath-room, opens
      slowly. Djalma appears. Two hours have elapsed since he committed a double
      murder, and believed that he had killed Adrienne in a fit of jealous fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants of Mdlle. de Cardoville, accustomed to Djalma&rsquo;s daily
      visits, no longer announced his arrival, and admitted him without
      difficulty, having received no orders to the contrary from their mistress.
      He had never before entered the bed-chamber, but, knowing that the
      apartment the lady occupied was on the first floor of the house, he had
      easily found it. As he entered that virgin sanctuary, his countenance was
      pretty calm, so well did he control his feelings, only a slight paleness
      tarnished the brilliant amber of his complexion. He wore that day a robe
      of purple cashmere, striped with silver&mdash;a color which did not show
      the stains of blood upon it. Djalma closed the door after him, and tore
      off his white turban, for it seemed to him as if a band of hot iron
      encircled his brow. His dark hair streamed around his handsome face. He
      crossed his arms upon his bosom, and looked slowly about him. When his
      eyes rested on Adrienne&rsquo;s bed, he started suddenly, and his cheek
      grew purple. Then he drew his hand across his brow, hung down his head,
      and remained standing for some moments in a dream, motionless as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a mournful silence of a few seconds&rsquo; duration, Djalma fell
      upon his knees, and raised his eyes to heaven. The Asiatic&rsquo;s
      countenance was bathed in tears, and no longer expressed any violent
      passion. On his features was no longer the stamp of hate, or despair, or
      the ferocious joy of vengeance gratified. It was rather the expression of
      grief at once simple and immense. For several minutes he was almost choked
      with sobs, and tears ran freely down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! dead!&rdquo; he murmured, in a half-stifled voice. &ldquo;She,
      who this morning slept so peacefully in this chamber! And I have killed
      her. Now that she is dead, what is her treachery to me? I should not have
      killed her for that. She had betrayed me; she loved the man whom I slew&mdash;she
      loved him! Alas! I could not hope to gain the preference,&rdquo; added he,
      with a touching mixture of resignation and remorse; &ldquo;I, poor,
      untaught youth&mdash;how could I merit her love? It was my fault that she
      did not love me; but, always generous, she concealed from me her
      indifference, that she might not make me too unhappy&mdash;and for that I
      killed her. What was her crime? Did she not meet me freely? Did she not
      open to me her dwelling? Did she not allow me to pass whole days with her?
      No doubt she tried to love me, and could not. I loved her with all the
      faculties of my soul, but my love was not such as she required. For that,
      I should not have killed her. But a fatal delusion seized me and, after it
      was done, I woke as from a dream. Alas! it was not a dream: I have killed
      her. And yet&mdash;until this evening&mdash;what happiness I owed to her&mdash;what
      hope&mdash;what joy! She made my heart better, nobler, more generous. All
      came from her,&rdquo; added the Indian, with a new burst of grief. &ldquo;That
      remained with me&mdash;no one could take from me that treasure of the past&mdash;that
      ought to have consoled me. But why think of it? I struck them both&mdash;her
      and the man&mdash;without a struggle. It was a cowardly murder&mdash;the
      ferocity of the tiger that tears its innocent prey!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma buried his face in his hands. Then, drying his tears, he resumed,
      &ldquo;I know, clearly, that I mean to die also. But my death will not
      restore her to life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the ground, and drew from his girdle Faringhea&rsquo;s bloody
      dagger; then, taking the little phial from the hilt, he threw the blood
      stained blade upon the ermine carpet, the immaculate whiteness of which
      was thus slightly stained with red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed Djalma, holding the phial with a convulsive
      grasp, &ldquo;I know well that I am about to die. It is right. Blood for
      blood; my life for hers. How happens it that my steel did not turn aside?
      How could I kill her?&mdash;but it is done&mdash;and my heart is full of
      remorse, and sorrow, an inexpressible tenderness&mdash;and I have come
      here&mdash;to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, in this chamber,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the heaven of my
      burning visions!&rdquo; And then he added, with a heartrending accent, as
      he again buried his face in his hands, &ldquo;Dead! dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I too shall soon be dead,&rdquo; he resumed, in a firmer
      voice. &ldquo;But, no! I will die slowly, gradually. A few drops of the
      poison will suffice; and, when I am quite certain of dying, my remorse
      will perhaps be less terrible. Yesterday, she pressed my hand when we
      parted. Who could have foretold me this?&rdquo; The Indian raised the
      phial resolutely to his lips. He drank a few drops of the liquor it
      contained, and replaced it on a little ivory table close to Adrienne&rsquo;s
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This liquor is sharp and hot,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now I am
      certain to die. Oh! that I may still have time to feast on the sight and
      perfume of this chamber&mdash;to lay my dying head on the couch where she
      has reposed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma fell on his knees beside the bed, and leaned against it his burning
      brow. At this moment, the ivory door, which communicated with the
      bath-room, rolled gently on its hinges, and Adrienne entered. The young
      lady had just sent away her woman, who had assisted to undress her. She
      wore a long muslin wrapper of lustrous whiteness. Her golden hair, neatly
      arranged in little plaits, formed two bands, which gave to her sweet face
      an extremely juvenile air. Her snowy complexion was slightly tinged with
      rose-color, from the warmth of the perfumed bath, which she used for a few
      seconds every evening. When she opened the ivory door, and placed her
      little naked foot, in its white satin slipper, upon the ermine carpet,
      Adrienne was dazzlingly beautiful. Happiness sparkled in her eyes, and
      adorned her brow. All the difficulties relative to her union with Djalma
      had now been removed. In two days she would be his. The sight of the
      nuptial chamber oppressed her with a vague and ineffable languor. The
      ivory door had been opened so gently, the lady&rsquo;s first steps were so
      soft upon the fur carpet, that Djalma, still leaning against the bed, had
      heard nothing. But suddenly a cry of surprise and alarm struck upon his
      ear. He turned round abruptly. Adrienne stood before him.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/30453m.jpg" alt="30453m&rdquo; width=" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30453.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      With an impulse of modesty, Adrienne closed her nightdress over her bosom,
      and hastily drew back, still more afflicted than angry at what she
      considered a guilty attempt on the part of Djalma. Cruelly hurt and
      offended, she was about to reproach him with his conduct, when she
      perceived the dagger, which he had thrown down upon the ermine carpet. At
      sight of this weapon, and the expression of fear and stupor which
      petrified the features of Djalma, who remained kneeling, motionless, with
      his body thrown back, hands stretched out, his eyes fixed and wildly
      staring Adrienne, no longer dreading an amorous surprise, was seized with
      an indescribable terror, and, instead of flying from the prince, advanced
      several steps towards him, and said, in an agitated voice, whilst she
      pointed to the kandjiar, &ldquo;My friend, why are you here? what ails
      you? why this dagger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma made no answer. At first, the presence of Adrienne seemed to him a
      vision, which he attributed to the excitement of his brain, already (it
      might be) under the influence of the poison. But when the soft voice
      sounded in his ears&mdash;when his heart bounded with the species of
      electric shock, which he always felt when he met the gaze of that woman so
      ardently beloved&mdash;when he had contemplated for an instant that
      adorable face, so fresh and fair, in spite of its expression of deep
      uneasiness&mdash;Djalma understood that he was not the sport of a dream,
      but that Mdlle. de Cardoville was really before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he began fully to grasp the thought that Adrienne was not dead,
      though he could not at all explain the prodigy of her resurrection, the
      Hindoo&rsquo;s countenance was transfigured, the pale gold of his
      complexion became warm and red, his eyes (tarnished by tears of remorse)
      shone with new radiance, and his features, so lately contracted with
      terror and despair, expressed all the phases of the most ecstatic joy.
      Advancing, still on his knees, towards Adrienne, he lifted up to her his
      trembling hands, and, too deeply affected to pronounce a word, he gazed on
      her with so much amazement, love, adoration, gratitude, that the young
      lady, fascinated by those inexplicable looks, remained mute also,
      motionless also, and felt, by the precipitate beating of her heart, and by
      the shudder which ran through her frame, that there was here some dreadful
      mystery to be unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Djalma, clasping his hands together, exclaimed with an accent
      impossible to describe, &ldquo;Thou art not dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; repeated the young lady, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not thou, really not thou, whom I killed? God is kind and
      just!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he pronounced these words with intense joy, the unfortunate youth
      forgot the victim whom he had sacrificed in error.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more alarmed, and again glancing at the dagger en which she now
      perceived marks of blood&mdash;a terrible evidence, in confirmation of the
      words of Djalma&mdash;Mdlle. de Cardoville exclaimed, &ldquo;You have
      killed some one, Djalma! Oh! what does he say? It is dreadful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are alive&mdash;I see you&mdash;you are here,&rdquo; said
      Djalma, in a voice trembling with rapture. &ldquo;You are here&mdash;beautiful!
      pure! for it was not you! Oh, no! had it been you, the steel would have
      turned back upon myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have killed some one?&rdquo; cried the young lady, beside her
      with this unforeseen revelation, and clasping her hands in horror. &ldquo;Why?
      whom did you kill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. A woman that was like you&mdash;a man that I thought
      your lover&mdash;it was an illusion, a frightful dream&mdash;you are alive&mdash;you
      are here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the oriental wept for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dream? but no, it is not a dream. There is blood upon that
      dagger!&rdquo; cried the young lady, as she pointed wildly to the
      kandjiar. &ldquo;I tell you there is blood upon it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I threw it down just now, when I took the poison from it,
      thinking that I had killed you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poison!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, and her teeth chattered
      convulsively. &ldquo;What poison?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had killed you, and I came here to die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To die? Oh! wherefore? who is to die?&rdquo; cried the young lady,
      almost in delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied Djalma, with inexpressible tenderness, &ldquo;I
      thought I had killed you&mdash;and I took poison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrienne, becoming pale as death. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is not true!&rdquo; said the young lady, shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the Asiatic. Mechanically, he turned towards the
      bed&mdash;towards the little ivory table, on which sparkled the crystal
      phial.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden movement, swifter than thought, swifter, it may be, than the
      will, Adrienne rushed to the table, seized the phial, and applied it
      eagerly to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Djalma had hitherto remained on his knees; but he now uttered a terrible
      cry, made one spring to the drinker&rsquo;s side, and dragged away the
      phial, which seemed almost glued to her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter! I have swallowed as much as you,&rdquo; said Adrienne,
      with an air of gloomy triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, there followed an awful silence. Adrienne and Djalma gazed
      upon each other, mute, motionless, horror-struck. The young lady was the
      first to break this mournful silence, and said in a tone which she tried
      to make calm and steady, &ldquo;Well! what is there extraordinary in this?
      You have killed, and death most expiate your crime. It is just. I will not
      survive you. That also is natural enough. Why look at me thus? This poison
      has a sharp taste&mdash;does it act quickly! Tell me, my Djalma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not answer. Shuddering through all his frame, he looked
      down upon his hands. Faringhea had told the truth; a slight violet tint
      appeared already beneath the nails. Death was approaching, slowly, almost
      insensibly, but not the less certain. Overwhelmed with despair at the
      thought that Adrienne, too, was about to die, Djalma felt his courage fail
      him. He uttered a long groan, and hid his face in his hands. His knees
      shook under him, and he felt down upon the bed, near which he was
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; cried the young lady in horror, as she threw
      herself on her knees at Djalma&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;Death already? Do you
      hide your face from me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In her fright, she pulled his hands from before his face. That face was
      bathed in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; murmured he, through his sobs. &ldquo;The
      poison is slow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried Adrienne, with ineffable joy. Then, kissing
      the hands of Djalma, she added tenderly, &ldquo;If the poison is slow, why
      do you weep?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you! for you!&rdquo; said the Indian, in a heart-rending tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not of me,&rdquo; replied Adrienne, resolutely. &ldquo;You
      have killed, and we must expiate the crime. I know not what has taken
      place; but I swear by our love that you did not do evil for evil&rsquo;s
      sake. There is some horrible mystery in all this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a pretence which I felt bound to believe,&rdquo; replied Djalma,
      speaking quickly, and panting for breath, &ldquo;Faringhea led me to a
      certain house. Once there, he told me that you had betrayed me. I did not
      believe him, but I know not what strange dizziness seized upon me&mdash;and
      then, through a half-obscurity, I saw you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not you&mdash;but a woman resembling you, dressed like
      you, so that I believed the illusion&mdash;and then there came a man&mdash;and
      you flew to meet him&mdash;and I&mdash;mad with rage&mdash;stabbed her,
      stabbed him, saw them fall&mdash;and so came here to die. And now I find
      you only to cause your death. Oh, misery! misery! that you should die
      through me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Djalma, this man of formidable energy, began again to weep with the
      weakness of a child. At sight of this deep, touching, passionate despair,
      Adrienne, with that admirable courage which women alone possess in love,
      thought only of consoling Djalma. By an effort of superhuman passion, as
      the prince revealed to her this infernal plot, the lady&rsquo;s
      countenance became so splendid with an expression of love and happiness,
      that the East Indian looked at her in amazement, fearing for an instant
      that he must have lost his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more tears, my adored!&rdquo; cried the young lady, exultingly.
      &ldquo;No more tears&mdash;but only smiles of joy and love! Our cruel
      enemies shall not triumph!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wished to make us miserable. We pity them. Our felicity shall
      be the envy of the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrienne&mdash;bethink you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I have all my senses about me. Listen to me, my adored! I now
      understand it all. Falling into a snare, which these wretches spread for
      you, you have committed murder. Now, in this country, murder leads to
      infamy, or the scaffold&mdash;and to-morrow&mdash;to-night, perhaps&mdash;you
      would be thrown into prison. But our enemies have said: &lsquo;A man like
      Prince Djalma does not wait for infamy&mdash;he kills himself. A woman
      like Adrienne de Cardoville does not survive the disgrace or death of her
      lover&mdash;she prefers to die.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore a frightful death awaits them both,&rdquo; said the
      black-robed men; &ldquo;and that immense inheritance, which we covet&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for you&mdash;so young, so beautiful so innocent&mdash;death is
      frightful, and these monsters triumph!&rdquo; cried Djalma. &ldquo;They
      have spoken the truth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have lied!&rdquo; answered Adrienne. &ldquo;Our death shall be
      celestial. This poison is slow&mdash;and I adore you, my Djalma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke those words in a low voice, trembling with passionate love, and,
      leaning upon Djalma&rsquo;s knees, approached so near, that he felt her
      warm breath upon his cheek. As he felt that breath, and saw the humid
      flame that darted from the large, swimming eyes of Adrienne, whose half
      opened lips were becoming of a still deeper and brighter hue, the Indian
      started&mdash;his young blood boiled in his veins&mdash;he forgot
      everything&mdash;his despair, and the approach of death, which as yet (as
      with Adrienne), only showed itself in a kind of feverish ardor. His face,
      like the young girl&rsquo;s, became once more splendidly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my lover! my husband! how beautiful you are!&rdquo; said
      Adrienne, with idolatry. &ldquo;Those eyes&mdash;that brow&mdash;those
      lips&mdash;how I love them!&mdash;How many times has the remembrance of
      your grace and beauty, coupled with your love, unsettled my reason, and
      shaken my resolves&mdash;even to this moment, when I am wholly yours!&mdash;Yes,
      heaven wills that we should be united. Only this morning, I gave to the
      apostolic man, that was to bless our union, in thy name and mine, a royal
      gift&mdash;a gift, that will bring joy and peace to the heart of many an
      unfortunate creature. Then what have we to regret, my beloved? Our
      immortal souls will pass away in a kiss, and ascend, full of love, to that
      God who is all love!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrienne!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Djalma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The light, transparent curtains fell like a cloud over that nuptial and
      funereal couch. Yes, funereal; for, two hours after, Adrienne and Djalma
      breathed their last sigh in a voluptuous agony.

      CHAPTER LXVI. A DUEL TO THE DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>drienne and Djalma
      died on the 30th of May. The following scene took place on the 31st, the
      eve of the day appointed for the last convocation of the heirs of Marius
      de Rennepont. The reader will no doubt remember the room occupied by M.
      Hardy, in the &ldquo;house of retreat,&rdquo; in the Rue de Vaugirard&mdash;a
      gloomy and retired apartment, opening on a dreary little garden, planted
      with yew-trees, and surrounded by high walls. To reach this chamber, it
      was necessary to cross two vast rooms, the doors of which, once shut,
      intercepted all noise and communication from without. Bearing this in
      mind, we may go on with our narrative. For the last three or four days,
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny occupied this apartment. He had not chosen it, but
      had been induced to accept it, under most plausible pretexts, given him at
      the instigation of Rodin. It was about noon. Seated in an arm-chair, by
      the window opening on the little garden, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny held in
      his hand a newspaper, in which he read as follows, under the head of
      &ldquo;Paris:&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven p.m.&mdash;A most horrible and tragical event has just
      excited the greatest consternation in the quarter of the Rue de Richelieu.
      A double murder has been committed, on the person of a young man and
      woman. The girl was killed on the spot, by the stroke of a dagger; hopes
      are entertained of saving the life of the young man. The crime is
      attributed to jealousy. The officers of justice are investigating the
      matter. We shall give full particulars tomorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had read these lines, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny threw down the paper
      and remained in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is incredible,&rdquo; said he, with bitter envy, in allusion to
      Rodin. &ldquo;He has attained his end. Hardly one of his anticipations has
      been defeated. This family is annihilated, by the mere play of the
      passions, good and evil that he has known how to set in motion. He said it
      would be so. Oh! I must confess,&rdquo; added Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a jealous and hateful smile, &ldquo;that Rodin is a man of rare
      dissimulation, patience, energy, obstinacy and intelligence. Who would
      have told a few months ago, when he wrote under my orders, a discreet and
      humble socius, that he had already conceived the most audacious ambition,
      and dared to lift his eyes to the Holy See itself? that, thanks to
      intrigues and corruption, pursued with wondrous ability, these views were
      not so unreasonable? Nay, that this infernal ambition would soon be
      realized, were it not that the secret proceedings of this dangerous man
      have long been as secretly watched?&mdash;Ah!&rdquo; sneered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      with a smile of irony and triumph, &ldquo;you wish to be a second Sixtus
      V., do you? And, not content with this audacious pretension, you mean, if
      successful, to absorb our Company in the Papacy, even as the Sultan has
      absorbed the Janissaries. Ah! You would make us your stepping-stone to
      power! And you have thought to humiliate and crush me with your insolent
      disdain! But patience, patience: the day of retribution approaches. I
      alone am the depository of our General&rsquo;s will. Father Caboccini
      himself does not know that. The fate of Rodin is in my hands. Oh! it will
      not be what he expects. In this Rennepont affair (which, I must needs
      confess, he has managed admirably), he thinks to outwit us all, and to
      work only for himself. But to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny was suddenly disturbed in these agreeable
      reflections. He heard the door of the next room open, and, as he turned
      round to see who was coming, the door of the apartment in which he was
      turned upon its hinges. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny started with surprise, and
      became almost purple. Marshal Simon stood before him. And, behind the
      marshal, in the shadow of the door, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny perceived the
      cadaverous face of Rodin. The latter cast on him one glance of diabolical
      delight, and instantly disappeared. The door was again closed, and Father
      d&rsquo;Aigrigny and Marshal Simon were left alone together. The father of
      Rose and Blanche was hardly recognizable. His gray hair had become
      completely white. His pale, thin face had not been shaved for some days.
      His hollow eyes were bloodshot and restless, and had in them something
      wild and haggard. He was wrapped in a large cloak, and his black cravat
      was tied loosely about his neck. In withdrawing from the apartment, Rodin
      had (as if by inadvertence) double-locked the door on the outside. When he
      was alone with the Jesuit, the marshal threw back his cloak from his
      shoulders, and Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny could see two naked swords, stuck
      through a silk handkerchief which served him as a belt.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/30461.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny understood it all. He remembered how, a few days
      before, Rodin had obstinately pressed him to say what he would do if the
      marshal were to strike him in the face. There could be no doubt that he,
      who thought to have held the fate of Rodin in his hands, had been brought
      by the latter into a fearful peril; for he knew that, the two outer rooms
      being closed, there was no possibility of making himself heard, and that
      the high walls of the garden only bordered upon some vacant lots. The
      first thought which occurred to him, one by no means destitute of
      probability, was that Rodin, either by his agents at Rome, or by his own
      incredible penetration, had learned that his fate depended on Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      and hoped therefore to get rid of him, by delivering him over to the
      inexorable vengeance of the father of Rose and Blanche. Without speaking a
      word, the marshal unbound the handkerchief from his waist, laid the two
      swords upon the table, and, folding his arms upon his breast, advanced
      slowly towards Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny. Thus these two men, who through
      life had pursued each other with implacable hatred, at length met face to
      face&mdash;they, who had fought in hostile armies, and measured swords in
      single combat, and one of whom now came to seek vengeance for the death of
      his children. As the marshal approached, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny rose from
      his seat. He wore that day a black cassock, which rendered still more
      visible the pale hue, which had now succeeded to the sudden flush on his
      cheek. For a few seconds, the two men stood face to face without speaking.
      The marshal was terrific in his paternal despair. His calmness, inexorable
      as fate, was more impressive than the most furious burst of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My children are dead,&rdquo; said he at last, in a slow and hollow
      tone. &ldquo;I come to kill you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, &ldquo;listen to me. Do
      not believe&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must kill you,&rdquo; resumed the marshal, interrupting the
      Jesuit; &ldquo;your hate followed my wife into exile, where she perished.
      You and your accomplices sent my children to certain death. For twenty
      years you have been my evil genius. I must have your life, and I will have
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life belongs, first, to God,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      piously, &ldquo;and then to who likes to take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will fight to the death in this room,&rdquo; said the marshal;
      &ldquo;and, as I have to avenge my wife and children, I am tranquil as to
      the result.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, coldly, &ldquo;you
      forget that my profession forbids me to fight. Once I accepted your
      challenge&mdash;but my position is changed since then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the marshal, with a bitter smile; &ldquo;you refuse
      to fight because you are a priest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;because I am a priest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, because he is a priest, a wretch like you may commit any
      crime, any baseness, under shelter of his black gown?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand a word of your accusations. In any case, the
      law is open,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, biting his pale lips,
      for he felt deeply the insult offered by the marshal; &ldquo;if you have
      anything to complain of, appeal to that law, before which all are equal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marshal Simon shrugged his shoulders in angry disdain. &ldquo;Your crimes
      escape the law&mdash;and, could it even reach you, that would not satisfy
      my vengeance, after all the evil you have done me, after all you have
      taken from me,&rdquo; said the marshal; and, at the memory of his
      children, his voice slightly trembled; but he soon proceeded, with
      terrible calmness: &ldquo;You must feel that I now only live for
      vengeance. And I must have such revenge as is worth the seeking&mdash;I
      must have your coward&rsquo;s heart palpitating on the point of my sword.
      Our last duel was play; this will be earnest&mdash;oh! you shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The marshal walked up to the table, where he had laid the two swords.
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny needed all his resolution to restrain himself. The
      implacable hate which he had always felt for Marshal Simon, added to these
      insults, filled him with savage ardor. Yet he answered, in a tone that was
      still calm: &ldquo;For the last time, sir, I repeat to you, that my
      profession forbids me to fight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse?&rdquo; said the marshal, turning abruptly towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively. Nothing on earth should force me to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said the marshal, as his hand fell with its
      full force on the cheek of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit uttered a cry of fury; all his blood rushed to his face, so
      roughly handled; the courage of the man (for he was brave), his ancient
      military ardor, carried him away; his eyes sparkled, and, with teeth
      firmly set, and clenched fists, he advanced towards the marshal,
      exclaiming: &ldquo;The swords! the swords!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, remembering the appearance of Rodin, and the interest which
      the latter had in bringing about this encounter, he determined to avoid
      the diabolical snare laid by his former socius, and so gathered sufficient
      resolution to restrain his terrible resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his passing fury succeeded a calm, full of contrition; and, wishing to
      play his part out to the end, he knelt down, and bowing his head and
      beating his bosom, repeated: &ldquo;Forgive me, Lord, for yielding to a
      movement of rage! and, above all, forgive him who has injured me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his apparent resignation, the Jesuit&rsquo;s voice was neatly
      agitated. He seemed to feel a hot iron upon his cheek, for never before in
      his life, whether as a soldier or a priest, had he suffered such an
      insult. He had thrown himself upon his knees, partly from religious
      mummery, and partly to avoid the gaze of the marshal, fearing that, were
      he to meet his eye, he should not be able to answer for himself, but give
      way to his impetuous feelings. On seeing the Jesuit kneel down, and on
      hearing his hypocritical invocation, the marshal, whose sword was in his
      hand, shook with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand up, scoundrel!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;stand up, wretch!&rdquo;
      And he spurned the Jesuit with his boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this new insult, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny leaped up, as if he had been
      moved by steel springs. It was too much; he could bear no more. Blinded
      with rage, he rushed to the able, caught up the other sword, and
      exclaimed, grinding his teeth together: &ldquo;Ah! you will have blood.
      Well then! it shall be yours&mdash;if possible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Jesuit, still in all the vigor of manhood, his face purple, his
      large gray eyes sparkling with hate, fell upon his guard with the ease and
      skill of a finished swordsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; cried the marshal, as their blades were about to
      cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once more reflection came to damp the fire of the Jesuit. He
      remembered how this hazardous duel would gratify the wishes of Rodin,
      whose fate was in his hands, and whom he hated perhaps even more than the
      marshal. Therefore, in spite of the fury which possessed him, in spite of
      his secret hope to conquer in this combat, so strong and healthy did he
      feel himself, and so fatal had been the effects of grief on the
      constitution of Marshal Simon, he succeeded in mastering his rage, and, to
      the amazement of the marshal, dropped the point of his sword, exclaiming:
      &ldquo;I am a minister of the Lord, and must not shed blood. Forgive ne,
      heaven! and, oh! forgive my brother also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then placing the blade beneath his heel, he drew the hilt suddenly towards
      him, and broke the weapon into two pieces. The duel was no longer
      possible. Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had put it out of his own power to yield
      to a new burst of violence, of which he saw the imminent danger. Marshal
      Simon remained for an instant mute and motionless with surprise and
      indignation, for he also saw that the duel was now impossible. But,
      suddenly, imitating the Jesuit, the marshal placed his blade also under
      his heel, broke it in half, and picking up the pointed end, about eighteen
      inches in length tore off his black silk cravat, rolled it round the
      broken part so as to form a handle, and said to Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny:
      &ldquo;Then we will fight with daggers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck with this mixture of coolness and ferocity, the Jesuit exclaimed:
      &ldquo;Is this then a demon of hell?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is a father, whose children have been murdered,&rdquo; said
      the marshal, in a hollow voice, whilst he fitted the blade to his hand,
      and a tear stood in the eye, that instantly after became fierce and
      ardent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit saw that tear. There was in this mixture of vindictive rage and
      paternal grief something so awful, and yet so sacred, that for the first
      time in his life Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny felt fear&mdash;cowardly, ignoble
      fear&mdash;fear for his own safety. While a combat with swords was in
      question, in which skill, agility, and experience are such powerful
      auxiliaries to courage, his only difficulty had been to repress the ardor
      of his hate&mdash;but when he thought of the combat proposed, body to
      body, face to face, heart to heart, he trembled, grew pale, and exclaimed:
      &ldquo;A butchery with knives?&mdash;never!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His countenance and the accent betrayed his alarm, so that the marshal
      himself was struck with it, and fearing to lose his revenge, he cried:
      &ldquo;After all, he is a coward! The wretch had only the courage or the
      vanity of a fencer. This pitiful renegade&mdash;this traitor to his
      country&mdash;whom I have cuffed, kicked&mdash;yes, kicked, most noble
      marquis!&mdash;shame of your ancient house&mdash;disgrace to the rank of
      gentleman, old or new&mdash;ah! it is not hypocrisy, it is not
      calculation, as I at first thought&mdash;it is fear! You need the noise of
      war, and the eyes of spectators to give you courage&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;have a care!&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny,
      stammering through his clenched teeth, for rage and hate now made him
      forget his fear-&ldquo;Must I then spit on you, to make the little blood
      you have left rise to your face?&rdquo; cried the exasperated marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this is too much! too much!&rdquo; said the Jesuit, seizing the
      pointed piece of the blade that lay at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not enough!&rdquo; said the marshal, panting for breath.
      &ldquo;There, Judas!&rdquo; and he spat in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will not fight now,&rdquo; added the marshal, &ldquo;I will
      beat you like a dog, base child-murderer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving the uttermost insult which can be offered to an already
      insulted man, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny lost all his presence of mind,
      forgot his interests, his resolutions, his fears, forgot even Rodin&mdash;felt
      only the frenzied ardor of revenge&mdash;and, recovering his courage,
      rejoiced in the prospect of a close struggle, in which his superior
      strength promised success over the enfeebled frame of the marshal for, in
      this kind of brutal and savage combat, physical strength offers an immense
      advantage. In an instant, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had rolled his
      handkerchief round the broken blade, and rushed upon Marshal Simon, who
      received the shock with intrepidity. For the short time that this unequal
      struggle lasted&mdash;unequal, for the marshal had since some days been a
      prey to a devouring fever, which had undermined his strength&mdash;the two
      combatants, mute in their fury, uttered not a word or a cry. Had any one
      been present at this horrible scene, it would have been impossible for him
      to tell how they dealt their blows. He would have seen two heads&mdash;frightful,
      livid, convulsed&mdash;rising, falling, now here, now there&mdash;arms,
      now stiff as bars of iron, and now twisting like serpents&mdash;and, in
      the midst of the undulation of the blue coat of the marshal and the black
      cassock of the Jesuit, from time to time the sudden gleam of the steel. He
      would have heard only a dull stamping, and now and then a deep breath. In
      about two minutes at most, the two adversaries fell, and rolled one over
      the other. One of them&mdash;it was Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny&mdash;contrived
      to disengage himself with a violent effort, and to rise upon his knees.
      His arms fell powerless by his side; and then the dying voice of the
      marshal murmured: &ldquo;My children! Dagobert!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have killed him,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in a weak
      voice; &ldquo;but I feel&mdash;that I am wounded&mdash;to death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning with one hand on the ground, the Jesuit pressed the other to his
      bosom. His black cassock was pierced through and through, but the blades,
      which had served for the combat, being triangular and very sharp, the
      blood instead of issuing from the wounds, was flowing inwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I die&mdash;I choke,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, whose
      features were already changing with the approach of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the key turned twice in the door, Rodin appeared on the
      threshold, and, thrusting in his head, he said in a humble and discreet
      voice: &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this dreadful irony, Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny strove to rise, and rush
      upon Rodin; but he fell back exhausted; the blood was choking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monster of hell!&rdquo; he muttered, casting on Rodin a terrible
      glance of rage and agony. &ldquo;Thou art the cause of my death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always told you, my dear father, that your old military habits
      would be fatal to you,&rdquo; answered Rodin with a frightful smile.
      &ldquo;Only a few days ago, I gave you warning, and advised you take a
      blow patiently from this old swordsman&mdash;who seems to have done with
      that work forever, which is well&mdash;for the Scripture says: &lsquo;All
      they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.&rsquo; And then this
      Marshal Simon might have had some claim on his daughter&rsquo;s
      inheritance. And, between ourselves, my dear father, what was I to do? It
      was necessary to sacrifice you for the common interest; the rather, that I
      well knew what you had in pickle for me to-morrow. But I am not so easily
      caught napping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I die,&rdquo; said Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, in a failing
      voice, &ldquo;I will unmask you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you will not,&rdquo; said Rodin, shaking his head with a
      knowing air; &ldquo;I alone, if you please, will receive your last
      confession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! this is horrible,&rdquo; moaned Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, whose
      eyes were closing. &ldquo;May God have mercy on me, if it is not too late!&mdash;Alas!
      at this awful moment, I feel that I have been a great sinner&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, above all, a great fool,&rdquo; said Rodin, shrugging his
      shoulders, and watching with cold disdain the dying moments of his
      accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny had now but a few minutes more to live. Rodin
      perceived it, and said: &ldquo;It is time to call for help.&rdquo; And the
      Jesuit ran, with an air of alarm and consternation, into the courtyard of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others came at his cries; but, as he had promised, Rodin had only quitted
      Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny as the latter had breathed his last sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, alone in his chamber, by the glimmer of a little lamp, Rodin
      sat plunged in a sort of ecstatic contemplation, before the print
      representing Sixtus V. The great house-clock struck twelve. At the last
      stroke, Rodin drew himself up in all the savage majesty of his infernal
      triumph, and exclaimed: &ldquo;This is the first of June. There are no
      more Renneponts!&mdash;Methinks, I hear the hour from the clock of St.
      Peter&rsquo;s at Rome striking!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LXVII. A MESSAGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile Rodin sat
      plunged in ambitious reverie, contemplating the portrait of Sixtus V.,
      good little Father Caboccini, whose warm embraces had so much irritated
      the first mentioned personage, went secretly to Faringhea, to deliver to
      him a fragment of an ivory crucifix, and said to him with his usual air of
      jovial good-nature: &ldquo;His Excellency Cardinal Malipieri, on my
      departure from Rome, charged me to give you this only on the 31st of May.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-caste, who was seldom affected by anything, started abruptly,
      almost with an expression of pain. His face darkened, and bending upon the
      little father a piercing look, he said to him: &ldquo;You were to add
      something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Father Caboccini; &ldquo;the words I was to
      add are these: &lsquo;There is many a slip &lsquo;twixt the cup and the
      lip.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the other. Heaving a deep sigh, he joined
      the fragment of the ivory crucifix to a piece already in his possession;
      it fitted exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Caboccini looked at him with curiosity, for the cardinal had only
      told him to deliver the ivory fragment to Faringhea, and to repeat the
      above words. Being somewhat mystified with all this, the reverend father
      said to the half-caste: &ldquo;What are you going to do with that
      crucifix?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Faringhea, still absorbed in painful thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; resumed the reverend father, in astonishment.
      &ldquo;What, then, was the use of bringing it so far?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without satisfying his curiosity, Faringhea replied: &ldquo;At what hour
      to morrow does Father Rodin go to the Rue Saint Francois?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very early.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before leaving home, he will go to say prayers in the chapel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, according to the habit of our reverend fathers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sleep near him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being his socius, I occupy the room next to his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; said Faringhea, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, &ldquo;that the reverend father, full of the great interests
      which occupy his mind, might forget to go to the chapel. In that case,
      pray remind him of this pious duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not fail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not fail,&rdquo; repeated Faringhea, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied,&rdquo; said the good little father; &ldquo;I see that
      you take great interest in his salvation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very praiseworthy in you. Continue as you have begun, and you
      may one day belong, completely to our Company,&rdquo; said Father
      Caboccini, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as yet but a poor auxiliary member,&rdquo; said Faringhea,
      humbly; &ldquo;but no one is more devoted to the Society, body and soul.
      Bowanee is nothing to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowanee! who is that, my good friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowanee makes corpses which rot in the ground. The Society makes
      corpses which walk about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! Perinde ac cadaver&mdash;they were the last words of our
      great saint, Ignatius de Loyola. But who is this Bowanee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowanee is to the Society what a child is to a man,&rdquo; replied
      the Asiatic, with growing excitement. &ldquo;Glory to the Company&mdash;glory!
      Were my father its enemy, I would kill my father. The man whose genius
      inspires me most with admiration, respect, and terror&mdash;were he its
      enemy, I would kill, in spite of all,&rdquo; said the half-caste, with an
      effort. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, he looked full in Caboccini&rsquo;s
      face, and added: &ldquo;I say this, that you may report my words to
      Cardinal Malipieri, and beg him to mention them to&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faringhea stopped short. &ldquo;To whom should the cardinal mention your
      words?&rdquo; asked Caboccini.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows,&rdquo; replied the half-caste, abruptly. &ldquo;Good
      night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, my friend! I can only approve of your excellent
      sentiments with regard to our Company. Alas! it is in want of energetic
      defenders, for there are said to be traitors in its bosom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For those,&rdquo; said Faringhea, &ldquo;we must have no pity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the good little father; &ldquo;we understand
      one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the half-caste. &ldquo;Do not, at all events,
      forget to remind Father Rodin to go to chapel to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care of that,&rdquo; said Father Caboccini.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men parted. On his return to the house, Caboccini learned that a
      courier, only arrived that night from Rome, had brought despatches to
      Rodin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVIII. THE FIRST OF JUNE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he chapel
      belonging to the house of the reverend fathers in the Rue de Vaugirard,
      was gay and elegant. Large panes of stained glass admitted a mysterious
      light; the altar shone with gold and silver; and at the entrance of this
      little church, in an obscure corner beneath the organ loft, was a font for
      holy water in sculptured marble. It was close to this font, in a dark nook
      where he could hardly be seen, that Faringhea knelt down, early on the 1st
      of June, as soon indeed as the chapel doors were opened. The half-caste
      was exceedingly sad. From time to time he started and sighed, as if
      agitated by a violent internal struggle. This wild, untamable being,
      possessed with the monomania of evil and destruction, felt, as may be
      imagined, a profound admiration for Rodin, who exercised over him a kind
      of magnetic fascination. The half-caste, almost a wild beast in human
      form, saw something supernatural in the infernal genius of Rodin. And the
      latter, too sagacious not to have discovered the savage devotion of this
      wretch, had made, as we have seen, good use of him, is bringing about the
      tragical termination of the loves of Adrienne and Djalma. But what excited
      to an incredible degree the admiration of Faringhea, was what he knew of
      the Society of Jesus. This immense, occult power, which undermined the
      world by its subterraneous ramifications, and reached its ends by
      diabolical means, had inspired the half-caste with a wild enthusiasm. And
      if anything in the world surpassed his fanatical admiration for Rodin, it
      was his blind devotion to the Company of Ignatius de Loyola, which, as he
      said, could make corpses that walk about. Hid in the shadow of the
      organ-loft, Faringhea was reflecting deeply on these things, when
      footsteps were heard, and Rodin entered the chapel, accompanied by his
      socius, the little one-eyed father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from absence of mind, or that the shadow of the orange-loft
      completely concealed the half-caste, Rodin dipped his fingers into the
      font without perceiving Faringhea, who stood motionless as a statue,
      though a cold sweat streamed from his brow. The prayer of Rodin was, as
      may be supposed, short; he was in haste to get to the Rue Saint-Francois.
      After kneeling down with Father Caboccini for a few seconds, he rose,
      bowed respectfully to the altar, and returned towards the door, followed
      by his socius. At the moment Rodin approached the font he perceived the
      tall figure of the half-caste standing out from the midst of the dark
      shadow; advancing a little, Faringhea bowed respectfully to Rodin, who
      said to him, in a low voice; &ldquo;Come to me at two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rodin stretched forth his hand to dip it into the holy water;
      but Faringhea spared him the trouble, by offering him the sprinkling
      brush, which generally stood in the font.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing between his dirty fingers the damp hairs of the brush, which the
      half-caste held by the handle, Rodin wetted his thumb and forefinger, and,
      according to custom, traced the sign of the cross upon his forehead. Then,
      opening the door of the chapel, he went out, after again repeating to
      Faringhea: &ldquo;Come to me at two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking he would also make use of the sprinkling-brush, which, Faringhea,
      still motionless, held with a trembling hand, Father Caboccini stretched
      out his fingers to reach it, when the half-breed, as if determined to
      confine his favors to Rodin, hastily withdrew the instrument. Deceived in
      his expectation, Father Caboccini lost no time in following Rodin, whom he
      was not to leave that day for a single moment, and, getting into a
      hackney-coach with him, set out for the Rue Saint-Francois. It is
      impossible to describe the look which the half breed fixed upon Rodin as
      the latter quitted the chapel. Left alone in the sacred edifice, Faringhea
      sank upon the stones, half kneeling, half crouching, with his face buried
      in his hands. As the coach drew near the quarter of the Marais, in which
      was situated the house of Marius de Rennepont, a feverish agitation, and
      the devouring impatience of triumph, were visible on the countenance of
      Rodin. Two or three times he opened his pocketbook, and read and arranged
      the different certificates of death of the various members of the
      Rennepont family; and from time to time he thrust his head anxiously from
      the coach-window, as if he had wished to hasten the slow progress of the
      vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good little father, his socius, did not take his eye off Rodin, and
      his look had a strange and crafty expression. At last the coach entered
      the Rue Saint-Francois, and stopped before the iron-studded door of the
      old house, which had been closed for a century and a half. Rodin sprang
      from the coach with the agility of a young man, and knocked violently at
      the door, whilst Father Caboccini, less light of foot, descended more
      prudently to the ground. No answer was returned to the loud knocking of
      Rodin. Trembling with anxiety, he knocked again. This time, as he listened
      attentively, he heard slow steps approaching. They stopped at some
      distance from the door, which was not yet opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is keeping one upon red-hot coals,&rdquo; said Rodin, for he
      felt as if there was a burning fire in his chest. He again shook the door
      violently, and began to gnaw his nails according to his custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opened, and Samuel, the Jew guardian, appeared beneath
      the porch. The countenance of the old man expressed bitter grief. Upon his
      venerable cheeks were the traces of recent tears, which he strove to dry
      with his trembling hands, as he opened the door to Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, gentlemen?&rdquo; said Samuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the bearer of a power of attorney from the Abbe Gabriel, the
      only living representative of the Rennepont family,&rdquo; answered Rodin,
      hastily. &ldquo;This gentleman is my secretary,&rdquo; added he, pointing
      to Father Caboccini, who bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After looking attentively at Rodin, Samuel resumed: &ldquo;I recognize
      you, sir. Please to follow me.&rdquo; And the old guardian advanced
      towards the house in the garden, making a sign to the two reverend fathers
      to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That confounded old man kept me so long at the door,&rdquo; said
      Rodin to his socius, &ldquo;that I think I have caught a cold in
      consequence. My lips and throat are dried up, like parchment baked at the
      fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not take something, my dear, good father? Suppose you were
      to ask this man for a glass of water,&rdquo; cried the little one-eyed
      priest, with tender solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Rodin; &ldquo;it is nothing. I am devoured
      by impatience. That is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale and desolate, Bathsheba, the wife of Samuel, was standing at the door
      of the apartment she occupied with her husband, in the building next the
      street. As the Jew passed before her, he said, in Hebrew: &ldquo;The
      curtains of the Hall of Mourning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are closed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the iron casket?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is prepared,&rdquo; answered Bathsheba, also in Hebrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      After pronouncing these words, completely unintelligible to Rodin and
      Caboccini, Samuel and Bathsheba exchanged a bitter smile, notwithstanding
      the despair impressed on their countenances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascending the steps, followed by the two reverend fathers, Samuel entered
      the vestibule of the house, in which a lamp was burning. Endowed with an
      excellent local memory, Rodin was about to take the direction of the Red
      Saloon, in which had been held the first convocation of the heirs, when
      Samuel stopped him, and said: &ldquo;It is not that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, taking the lamp, he advanced towards a dark staircase, for the
      windows of the house had not been un-bricked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Rodin, &ldquo;the last time, we met in a saloon on
      the ground floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, we must go higher,&rdquo; answered Samuel, as he began
      slowly to ascend the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to? higher!&rdquo; said Rodin, following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Hall of Mourning,&rdquo; replied the Jew, and he continued
      to ascend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the Hall of Mourning?&rdquo; resumed Rodin, in some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A place of tears and death,&rdquo; answered the Israelite; and he
      kept on ascending through the darkness, for the little lamp threw but a
      faint light around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Rodin, more and more astonished, and stopping
      short on the stairs, &ldquo;why go to this place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money is there,&rdquo; answered Samuel, and he went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? if the money is there, that alters the case,&rdquo; replied
      Rodin; and he made haste to regain the few steps he had lost by stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel continued to ascend, and, at a turn of the staircase, the two
      Jesuits could see by the pale light of the little lamp, the profile of the
      old Israelite, in the space left between the iron balustrade and the wall,
      as he climbed on with difficulty above them. Rodin was struck with the
      expression of Samuel&rsquo;s countenance. His black eyes, generally so
      calm, sparkled with ardor. His features, usually impressed with a mixture
      of sorrow, intelligence, and goodness, seemed to grow harsh and stern, and
      his thin lips wore a strange smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so very high,&rdquo; whispered Rodin to Caboccini,
      &ldquo;and yet my legs ache, and I am quite out of breath. There is a
      strange throbbing too in my temples.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Rodin breathed hard, and with difficulty. To this confidential
      communication, good little Father Caboccini, in general so full of tender
      care for his colleague, made no answer. He seemed to be in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will we soon be there?&rdquo; said Rodin, impatiently, to Samuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are there,&rdquo; replied the Israelite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good thing too,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stopping in the midst of a corridor, he pointed with the hand in which he
      held the lamp to a large door from which streamed a faint light. In spite
      of his growing surprise. Rodin entered resolutely, followed by Father
      Caboccini and Samuel. The apartment in which these three personage, now
      found themselves was very large. The daylight only entered from a
      belvedere in the roof, the four sides of which had been covered with
      leaden plates, each of which was pierced with seven holes, forming a
      cross, thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             *
          * * *
             *
             *
             *
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, the light being only admitted through these holes, the obscurity
      would have been complete, had it not been for a lamp, which burned on a
      large massive slab of black marble, fixed against one of the walls. One
      would have taken it for a funeral chamber, for it was all hung with black
      curtains, fringed with white. There was no furniture, save the slab of
      black marble we have already mentioned. On this slab was an iron casket,
      of the manufacture of the seventeenth century, admirably adorned with open
      work, like lace made of metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing Rodin, who was wiping his forehead with his dirty handkerchief,
      and looking round him with surprise, but not fear, Samuel said to him:
      &ldquo;The will of the testator, however strange it may appear, is sacred
      with me, and must be accomplished in all things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Rodin; &ldquo;but what are we to do here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know presently, sir. You are the representative of the
      only remaining heir of the Rennepont family, the Abbe Gabriel de
      Rennepont?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and here are my papers,&rdquo; replied Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save time,&rdquo; resumed Samuel, &ldquo;I will, previous to the
      arrival of the magistrate, go through the inventory of the securities
      contained in this casket, which I withdrew yesterday from the custody of
      the Bank of France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The securities are there?&rdquo; cried Rodin, advancing eagerly
      towards the casket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Samuel, &ldquo;as by the list. Your
      secretary will call them over, and I will produce each in turn. They can
      then be replaced in the casket, which I will deliver up to you in presence
      of the magistrate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this seems perfectly correct,&rdquo; said Rodin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel delivered the list to Father Caboccini, and approaching the casket,
      touched a spring, which was not seen by Rodin. The heavy lid flew open,
      and, while Father Caboccini read the names of the different securities,
      Samuel showed them to Rodin, who returned them to the old Jew, after a
      careful examination. This verification did not last long, for this immense
      fortune was all comprised, as we already know, in eight government
      securities, five hundred thousand francs in bank-note, thirty five
      thousand francs in gold, and two hundred and fifty francs in silver&mdash;making
      in all an amount of two hundred and twelve millions, one hundred and
      seventy-five thousand francs. When Rodin had counted the last of the five
      hundred bank-notes, of a thousand francs each, he said, as he returned
      them to Samuel: &ldquo;It is quite right. Two hundred and twelve millions,
      one hundred and seventy-five thousand francs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no doubt almost choked with joy, for he breathed with difficulty,
      his eyes closed, and he was obliged to lean upon Father Caboccini&rsquo;s
      arm, as he said to him in an altered voice: &ldquo;It is singular. I
      thought myself proof against all such emotions; but what I feel is
      extraordinary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural paleness of the Jesuit increased so much, and he seemed so
      much agitated with convulsive movements, that Father Caboccini exclaimed:
      &ldquo;My dear father, collect yourself; do not let success overcome you
      thus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the little one-eyed man was, attending to Rodin, Samuel carefully
      replaced the securities in the iron casket. Thanks to his unconquerable
      energy, and to the joy he felt at seeing himself so near the term of his
      labors, Rodin mastered this attack of weakness, and drawing himself up,
      calm and proud, he said to Caboccini: &ldquo;It is nothing. I did not
      survive the cholera to die of joy on the first of June.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, though still frightfully pale, the countenance of the Jesuit shone
      with audacious confidence. But now, when Rodin appeared to be quite
      recovered, Father Caboccini seemed suddenly transformed. Though short,
      fat, and one-eyed, his features assumed on the instant so firm, harsh, and
      commanding an expression, that Rodin recoiled a step as he looked at him.
      Then Father Caboccini, drawing a paper from his pocket, kissed it
      respectfully, glanced sternly at Rodin, and read as follows, in a severe
      and menacing tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On receipt of the present rescript, the Reverend Father
      Rodin will deliver up all his powers to the Reverend Father Caboccini, who
      is alone commissioned, with the Reverend Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, to
      receive the inheritance of the Rennepont family, if, in His eternal
      justice, the Lord should restore this property, of which our Company has
      been wronged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Moreover, on receipt of the present rescript, the Reverend
      Father Rodin, in charge of a person to be named by the Reverend Father
      Caboccini, shall be conveyed to our house in the Town of Laval, to be kept
      in strict seclusion in his cell until further orders.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Father Caboccini handed the rescript to Rodin, that the latter might
      read the signature of the General of the Company. Samuel, greatly
      interested by this scene, drew a few steps nearer, leaving the casket
      half-open. Suddenly, Rodin burst into a loud laugh&mdash;a laugh of joy,
      contempt and triumph, impossible to describe. Father Caboccini looked at
      him with angry astonishment; when Rodin, growing still more imperious and
      haughty, and with an air of more sovereign disdain than ever, pushed aside
      the paper with the back of his dirty hand and said: &ldquo;What is the
      date of that scribble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eleventh of May,&rdquo; answered Father Caboccini in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a brief, that I received last night from Rome, under date
      of the eighteenth. It informs me that I am appointed GENERAL OF THE ORDER.
      Read!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Caboccini took the paper, read it, and remained thunderstruck.
      Then, returning it humbly to Rodin, he respectfully bent his knee before
      him. Thus seemed the ambitious views of Rodin accomplished. In spite of
      the hatred and suspicion of that party, of which Cardinal Malipieri was
      the representative and the chief, Rodin, by address and craft, audacity
      and persuasion, and in consequence of the high esteem in which his
      partisans at Rome held his rare capacity, had succeeded in deposing his
      General, and in procuring his own elevation to that eminent post. Now,
      according to his calculation, aided by the millions he was about to
      possess, it would be but one step from that post to the pontifical throne.
      A mute witness of this scene, Samuel smiled also with an air of triumph,
      as he closed the casket by means of the spring known only to himself. That
      metallic sound recalled Rodin from the heights of his mad ambition to the
      realities of life, and he said to Samuel in a sharp voice: &ldquo;You have
      heard? These millions must be delivered to me alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He extended his hands eagerly and impatiently towards the casket, as if he
      would have taken possession of it, before the arrival of the magistrate.
      Then Samuel in his turn seemed transfigured, and, folding his arms upon
      his breast, and drawing up his aged form to its full height, he assumed a
      threatening and imposing air. His eyes flashed with indignation, and he
      said in a solemn tone: &ldquo;This fortune&mdash;at first the humble
      remains of the inheritance of the most noble of men, whom the plots of the
      sons of Loyola drove to suicide&mdash;this fortune, which has since become
      royal in amount, thanks to the sacred probity of three generations of
      faithful servants&mdash;this fortune shall never be the reward of
      falsehood, hypocrisy and murder. No! the eternal justice of heaven will
      not allow it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On murder? what do you mean, sir?&rdquo; asked Rodin, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel made no answer. He stamped his foot, and extended his arm slowly
      towards the extremity of the apartment. Then Rodin and Father Caboccini
      beheld an awful spectacle. The draperies on the wall were drawn aside, as
      if by an invisible hand. Round a funeral vault, faintly illumined-by the
      bluish light of a silver lamp, six dead bodies were ranged upon black
      biers, dressed in long black robes. They were: Jacques Rennepont&mdash;Francois
      Hardy&mdash;Rose and Blanche Simon&mdash;Adrienne and Djalma. They
      appeared to be asleep. Their eyelids were closed, their hands crossed over
      their breasts. Father Caboccini, trembling in every limb, made the sign of
      the cross, and retreating to the opposite wall, buried his face in his
      hands. Rodin on the contrary, with agitated countenance, staring eyes, and
      hair standing on end, yielding to an invincible attraction, advanced
      towards those inanimate forms. One would have said that these last of the
      Renneponts had only just expired. They seemed to be in the first hour of
      the eternal sleep.(44)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold those whom thou host slain!&rdquo; cried Samuel, in a voice
      broken with sobs. &ldquo;Yea! your detestable plots caused their death&mdash;and,
      as they fell one by one, it was my pious care to obtain possession of
      their poor remains, that they may all repose in the same sepulchre. Oh!&mdash;cursed&mdash;cursed&mdash;cursed&mdash;be
      thou who has killed them! But their spoils shall escape thy murderous
      hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin, still drawn forward in spite of himself, had approached the funeral
      couch of Djalma. Surmounting his first alarm, the Jesuit, to assure
      himself that he was not the sport of frightful dream, ventured to touch
      the hands of the Asiatic&mdash;and found that they were damp and pliant,
      though cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit drew back in horror. For some seconds, he trembled
      convulsively. But, his first amazement over, reflection returned, and,
      with reflection came that invincible energy, that infernal obstinacy of
      character, that gave him so much power. Steadying himself on his legs,
      drawing his hand across his brow, raising his head, moistening his lips
      two or three times before he spoke&mdash;for his throat and mouth grew
      ever drier and hotter, without his being able to explain the cause&mdash;he
      succeeded in giving to his features an imperious and ironical expression,
      and, turning towards Samuel, who wept in silence, he said to him, in a
      hoarse, guttural voice: &ldquo;I need not show you the certificates of
      their death. There they are in person.&rdquo; And he pointed with his bony
      hand to the six dead bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words of his General, Father Caboccini again made the sign of the
      cross, as if he had seen a fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried Samuel; &ldquo;Thou hast quite abandoned
      this man. With what a calm look he contemplates his victims!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir!&rdquo; said Rodin, with a horrid smile; &ldquo;this is a
      natural waxwork exhibition, that is all. My calmness proves my innocence&mdash;and
      we had best come at once to business. I have an appointment at two o&rsquo;clock.
      So let us carry down this casket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced towards the marble slab. Seized with indignation and horror,
      Samuel threw himself before him, and, pressing with all his might on a
      knob in the lid of the casket&mdash;a knob which yielded to the pressure&mdash;he
      exclaimed: &ldquo;Since your infernal soul is incapable of remorse, it may
      perhaps be shaken by disappointed avarice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; cried Rodin. &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Samuel, in his turn assuming an air of savage
      triumph. &ldquo;I told you, that the spoils of your victims should escape
      your murderous hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he uttered these words, before through the open-work of the
      iron casket rose a light cloud of smoke, and an odor as of burnt paper
      spread itself through the room. Rodin understood it instantly. &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed, as he rushed forward to seize the casket. It had been made
      fast to the heavy marble slab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fire,&rdquo; said Samuel. &ldquo;In a few minutes, of that
      immense treasure there will remain nothing but ashes. And better so, than
      that it should belong to you or yours. This treasure is not mine, and it
      only remains for me to destroy it&mdash;since Gabriel de Rennepont will be
      faithful to the oath he has taken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! water! water!&rdquo; cried Rodin, as he covered the casket
      with his body, trying in vain to extinguish the flames, which, fanned by
      the current of air, now issued from the thousand apertures in the lid; but
      soon the intensity of the fire diminished, a few threads of bluish smoke
      alone mounted upwards&mdash;and then, all was extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was done! Breathless and faint, Rodin leaned against the marble
      slab. For the first time in his life, he wept; large tears of rage rolled
      down his cadaverous cheeks. But suddenly, dreadful pains, at first dull,
      but gradually augmenting in intensity, seized on him with so much fury,
      though he employed all his energy to struggle against them, that he fell
      on his knees, and, pressing his two hands to his chest, murmured with an
      attempt to smile: &ldquo;It is nothing. Do not be alarmed. A few spasms&mdash;that
      is all. The treasure is destroyed&mdash;but I remain General of the Order.
      Oh! I suffer. What a furnace!&rdquo; he added, writhing in agony. &ldquo;Since
      I entered this cursed house, I know not what ails me. If&mdash;I had not
      lived on roots&mdash;water&mdash;bread&mdash;which I go myself to buy&mdash;I
      should think&mdash;I was poisoned&mdash;for I triumph&mdash;and Cardinal
      Malipieri has long arms. Yes&mdash;I still triumph&mdash;for I will not
      die&mdash;this time no more than the other&mdash;I will not die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he stretched out his arms convulsively, he continued: &ldquo;It
      is fire that devours my entrails. No doubt, they have tried to poison me.
      But when? but how?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After another pause, Rodin again cried out, in a stifled voice: &ldquo;Help!
      help me, you that stand looking on&mdash;like, spectres!&mdash;Help me, I
      say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Horror-struck at this dreadful agony, Samuel and Father Caboccini were
      unable to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; repeated Rodin, in a tone of strangulation, &ldquo;This
      poison is horrible.&mdash;But how&mdash;&rdquo; Then, with a terrific cry
      of rage, as if a sudden idea had struck him, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Ha!
      Faringhea&mdash;this morning&mdash;the holy water&mdash;he knows such
      subtle poisons. Yes&mdash;it is he&mdash;he had an interview with
      Malipieri. The demon!&mdash;Oh! it was well played. The Borgias are still
      the same. Oh! it is all over. I die. They will regret me, the fools!&mdash;Oh!
      hell! hell! The Church knows not its loss&mdash;but I burn&mdash;help!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to his assistance. Quick steps were heard upon the stairs, and
      Dr. Baleinier, followed by the Princess de Saint-Dizier, appeared at the
      entrance of the Hall of Mourning. The princess had learned vaguely that
      morning the death of Father d&rsquo;Aigrigny, and had come to question
      Rodin upon the subject. When this woman, entering the room, suddenly saw
      the frightful spectacle that offered itself to her view&mdash;when she saw
      Rodin writhing in horrible agony, and, further on, by the light of the
      sepulchral lamp, those six corpses&mdash;and, amongst them, her own niece,
      and the two orphans whom she had sent to meet their death&mdash;she stood
      petrified with horror, and her reason was unable to withstand the shock.
      She looked slowly round her, and then raised her arms on high, and burst
      into a wild fit of laughter. She had gone mad. Whilst Dr. Baleinier
      supported the head of Rodin, who expired in his arms, Faringhea appeared
      at the door; remaining in the shade, he cast a ferocious glance at the
      corpse of the Jesuit. &ldquo;He would have made himself the chief of the
      Company of Jesus, to destroy it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;with me, the
      Company of Jesus stands in the place of Bowanee. I have obeyed the
      cardinal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (44) Should this appear incredible, we would remind the reader of the
      marvellous discoveries in the art of embalming&mdash;particularly Dr.
      Gannal&rsquo;s.

      CHAPTER I. FOUR YEARS AFTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>our years had
      elapsed, since the events we have just related, when Gabriel de Rennepont
      wrote the following letter to Abbe Joseph Charpentier, curate of the
      Parish of Saint-Aubin, a hamlet of Sologne:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Springwater Farm, &ldquo;June 2d, 1836.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intending to write to you yesterday, my bear Joseph, I seated
      myself at the little old black table, that you will remember well. My
      window looks, you know, upon the farmyard, and I can see all that takes
      place there. These are grave preliminaries, my friend, but I am coming to
      the point. I had just taken my seat at the table, when, looking from the
      window, this is what I saw. You, my dear Joseph, who can draw so well,
      should have been there to have sketched the charming scene. The sun was
      sinking, the sky serene, the air warm and balmy with the breath of the
      hawthorn, which, flowering by the side of a little rivulet, forms the edge
      which borders the yard. Under the large pear-tree, close to the wall of
      the barn, sat upon the stone bench my adopted father, Dagobert, that brave
      and honest soldier whom you love so much. He appeared thoughtful, his
      white head was bowed on his bosom; with absent mind, he patted old
      Spoil-sport, whose intelligent face was resting on his master&rsquo;s
      knees. By his side was his wife, my dear adopted mother, occupied with her
      sewing; and near them, on a stool, sat Angela, the wife of Agricola,
      nursing her last-born child, while the gentle Magdalen, with the eldest
      boy in her lap, was occupied in teaching him the letters of the alphabet.
      Agricola had just returned from the fields, and was beginning to unyoke
      his cattle, when, struck, like me, no doubt, with this picture, he stood
      gazing on it for a moment, with his hand still leaning on the yoke,
      beneath which bent submissive the broad foreheads of his two large black
      oxen. I cannot express to you, my friend, the enchanting repose of this
      picture, lighted by the last rays of the sun, here and there broken by the
      thick foliage. What various and touching types! The venerable face of the
      soldier&mdash;the good, loving countenance of my adopted mother&mdash;the
      fresh beauty of Angela, smiling on her little child&mdash;the soft
      melancholy of the hunchback, now and then pressing her lips to the fair,
      laughing cheek of Agricola&rsquo;s eldest son&mdash;and then Agricola
      himself, in his manly beauty, which seems to reflect so well the valor and
      honesty of his heart! Oh, my Friend! in contemplating this assemblage of
      good, devoted, noble, and loving beings, so dear to each other, living
      retired in a little farm of our poor Sologne, my heart rose towards heaven
      with a feeling of ineffable gratitude. This peace of the family circle&mdash;this
      clear evening, with the perfume of the woods and wild flowers wafted on
      the breeze&mdash;this deep silence, only broken by the murmur of the
      neighboring rill&mdash;all affected me with one of these passing fits of
      vague and sweet emotion, which one feels but cannot express. You well know
      it, my friend, who, in your solitary walks, in the midst of your immense
      plains of flowering heath, surrounded by forests of fir trees, often feel
      your eyes grow moist, without being able to explain the cause of that
      sweet melancholy, which I, too, have often felt, during those glorious
      nights passed in the profound solitudes of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, alas! a painful incident disturbed the serenity of the
      picture. Suddenly I heard Dagobert&rsquo;s wife say to him: &lsquo;My dear&mdash;you
      are weeping!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At these words, Agricola, Angela, and Magdalen gathered round the
      soldier. Anxiety was visible upon every face. Then, as he raised his head
      abruptly, one could see two large tears trickle down his cheek to his
      white moustache. &lsquo;It is nothing, my children,&rsquo; said he, in a
      voice of emotion &lsquo;it is nothing. Only, to-day is the first of June&mdash;and
      this day four years&mdash;&rsquo; He could not complete the sentence; and,
      as he raised his hands to his eyes, to brush away the tears, we saw that
      he held between his fingers a little bronze chain, with a medal suspended
      to it. That is his dearest relic. Four years ago, almost dying with
      despair at the loss of the two angels, of whom I have so often spoken to
      you, my friend, he took from the neck of Marshal Simon, brought home dead
      from a fatal duel, this chain and medal which his children had so long
      worn. I went down instantly, as you may suppose, to endeavor to soothe the
      painful remembrances of this excellent man; gradually, he grew calmer, and
      the evening was passed in a pious and quiet sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot imagine, my friend, when I returned to my chamber, what
      cruel thoughts came to my mind, as I recalled those past events, from
      which I generally turn away with fear and horror. Then I saw once more the
      victims of those terrible and mysterious plots, the awful depths of which
      have never been penetrated thanks to the death of Father d&rsquo;A. and
      Father R., and the incurable madness of Madame de St.-D., the three
      authors or accomplices of the dreadful deeds. The calamities occasioned by
      them are irreparable; for those who were thus sacrificed to a criminal
      ambition, would have been the pride of humanity by the good they would
      have done. Ah, my friend! if you had known those noble hearts; if you had
      known the projects of splendid charity, formed by that young lady, whose
      heart was so generous, whose mind so elevated, whose soul so great! On the
      eve of her death, as a kind of prelude to her magnificent designs, after a
      conversation, the subject of which I must keep secret, even from you, she
      put into my hands a considerable sum, saying, with her usual grace and
      goodness: &lsquo;I have been threatened with ruin, and it might perhaps
      come. What I now confide to you will at least be safe&mdash;safe&mdash;for
      those who suffer. Give much&mdash;give freely&mdash;make as many happy
      hearts as you can. My happiness shall have a royal inauguration!!&rsquo; I
      do not know whether I ever told you, my friend, that, after those fatal
      events, seeing Dagobert and his wife reduced to misery, poor &lsquo;Mother
      Bunch&rsquo; hardly able to earn a wretched subsistence, Agricola soon to
      become a father, and myself deprived of my curacy, and suspended by my
      bishop, for having given religious consolations to a Protestant, and
      offered up prayers at the tomb of an unfortunate suicide&mdash;I
      considered myself justified in employing a small portion of the sum
      intrusted to me by Mdlle. de Cardoville in the purchase of this farm in
      Dagobert&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my friend, such is the origin of my fortune. The farmer to
      whom these few acres formerly belonged, gave us the rudiments of our
      agricultural education, and common sense, and the study of a few good
      practical books, completed it. From an excellent workman, Agricola has
      become an equally excellent husbandman; I have tried to imitate him, and
      have put my hand also to the plough there is no derogation in it, for the
      labor which provides food for man is thrice hallowed, and it is truly to
      serve and glorify God, to cultivate and enrich the earth He has created.
      Dagobert, when his first grief was a little appeased, seemed to gather new
      vigor from this healthy life of the fields; and, during his exile in
      Siberia, he had already learned to till the ground. Finally, my dear
      adopted mother and sister, and Agricola&rsquo;s good wife, have divided
      between them the household cares; and God has blessed this little colony
      of people, who, alas! have been sorely tried by misfortune, and who now
      only ask of toil and solitude, a quite, laborious, innocent life, and
      oblivion of great sorrows. Sometimes, in our winter evenings, you have
      been able to appreciate the delicate and charming mind of the gentle
      &lsquo;Mother Bunch,&rsquo; the rare poetical imagination of Agricola, the
      tenderness of his mother, the good sense of his father, the exquisite
      natural grace of Angela. Tell me, my friend, was it possible to unite more
      elements of domestic happiness? What long evenings have we passed round
      the fire of crackling wood, reading, or commenting on a few immortal
      works, which always warm the heart, and enlarge the soul! What sweet talk
      have we had, prolonged far into the night! And then Agricola&rsquo;s
      pastorals, and the timid literary confidences of Magdalen! And the fresh,
      clear voice of Angela, joined to the deep manly tones of Agricola, in
      songs of simple melody! And the old stories of Dagobert, so energetic and
      picturesque in their warlike spirit! And the adorable gayety of the
      children, in their sports with good old Spoil-sport, who rather lends
      himself to their play than takes part in it&mdash;for the faithful,
      intelligent creature seems always to be looking for somebody, as Dagobert
      says&mdash;and he is right. Yes, the dog also regrets those two angels, of
      whom he was the devoted guardian!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think, my friend, that our happiness makes us forgetful. No,
      no; not a day passes without our repeating, with pious and tender respect,
      those names so dear to our heart. And these painful memories, hovering
      forever about us, give to our calm and happy existence that shade of mild
      seriousness which struck you so much. No doubt, my friend, this kind of
      life, bounded by the family circle, and not extending beyond, for the
      happiness or improvement of our brethren, may be set down as selfish; but,
      alas! we have not the means&mdash;and though the poor man always finds a
      place at our frugal table, and shelter beneath our roof, we must renounce
      all great projects of fraternal action. The little revenue of our farm
      just suffices to supply our wants. Alas! when I think over it,
      notwithstanding a momentary regret, I cannot blame my resolution to keep
      faithfully my sacred oath, and to renounce that great inheritance, which,
      alas! had become immense by the death of my kindred. Yes, I believe I
      performed a duty, when I begged the guardian of that treasure to reduce it
      to ashes, rather than let it fall into the hands of people, who would have
      made an execrable use of it, or to perjure myself by disputing a donation
      which I had granted freely, voluntarily, sincerely. And yet, when I
      picture to myself the realization of the magnificent views of&mdash;my
      ancestor&mdash;an admirable Utopia, only possible with immense resources&mdash;and
      which Mdlle. de Cardoville hoped to carry into execution, with the aid of
      M. Francois Hardy, of Prince Djalma, of Marshal Simon and his daughters,
      and of myself&mdash;when I think of the dazzling focus of living forces,
      which such an association would have been, and of the immense influence it
      might have had on the happiness of the whole human race&mdash;my
      indignation and horror, as an honest man and a Christian, are excited
      against that abominable Company, whose black plots nipped in their bud all
      those great hopes, which promised so much for futurity. What remains now
      of all these splendid projects? Seven tombs. For my grave also is dug in
      that mausoleum, which Samuel has erected on the site of the house in the
      Rue Neuve-Saint-Francois, and of which he remains the keeper&mdash;faithful
      to the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had written thus far, my friend, when I received your letter. So,
      after having forbidden you to see me, your bishop now orders that you
      shall cease to correspond with me. Your touching, painful regrets have
      deeply moved me, my friend. Often have we talked together of
      ecclesiastical discipline, and of the absolute power of the bishops over,
      us, the poor working clergy, left to their mercy without remedy. It is
      painful, but it is the law of the church, my friend, and you have sworn to
      observe it. Submit as I have submitted. Every engagement is binding upon
      the man of honor! My poor, dear Joseph! would that you had the
      compensations which remained to me, after the rupture of ties that I so
      much value. But I know too well what you must feel&mdash;I cannot go on I
      find it impossible to continue this letter, I might be bitter against
      those whose orders we are bound to respect. Since it must be so, this
      letter shall be my last. Farewell, my friend! farewell forever. My heart
      is almost broken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE REDEMPTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ay was about to
      dawn. A rosy light, almost imperceptible, began to glimmer in the east;
      but the stars still shone, sparkling with radiance, upon the azure of the
      zenith. The birds awoke beneath the fresh foliage of the great woods; and,
      with isolated warblings, sang the prelude of their morning-concert. A
      light mist rose from the high grass, bathed in nocturnal dew, while the
      calm and limpid waters of a vast lake reflected the whitening dawn in
      their deep, blue mirror. Everything promised one of those warm and joyous
      days, that belong to the opening of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way up the slope of a hill, facing the east, a tuft of old, moss
      grown willows, whose rugged bark disappeared beneath the climbing branches
      of wild honeysuckle and harebells, formed a natural harbor; and on their
      gnarled and enormous roots, covered with thick moss, were seated a man and
      a woman, whose white hair, deep wrinkles, and bending figures, announced
      extreme old age. And yet this woman had only lately been young and
      beautiful, with long black hair overshadowing her pale forehead. And yet
      this man had, a short time ago, been still in the vigor of his age. From
      the spot where this man and woman were reposing, could be seen the valley,
      the lake, the woods, and, soaring above the woods, the blue summit of a
      high mountain, from behind which the sun was about to rise. This picture,
      half veiled by the pale transparency of the morning twilight, was
      pleasing, melancholy, and solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my sister!&rdquo; said the old man to the woman, who was
      reposing with him beneath the rustic arbor formed by the tuft of
      willow-trees; &ldquo;oh, my sister! how many times during the centuries in
      which the hand of the Lord carried us onward, and, separated from each
      other, we traversed the world from pole to pole&mdash;how many times we
      have witnessed this awakening of nature with a sentiment of incurable
      grief!&mdash;Alas! it was but another day of wandering&mdash;another
      useless day added to our life, since it brought death no nearer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now what happiness, oh, my brother! since the Lord has had
      mercy on us, and, with us, as with all other creatures, every returning
      day is a step nearer to the grave. Glory to Him! yes, glory!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glory to Him, my sister! for since yesterday, when we again met, I
      feel that indescribable languor which announces the approach of death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you, my brother, I feel my strength, already shaken, passing
      away in a sweet exhaustion. Doubtless, the term of our life approaches.
      The wrath of the Lord is satisfied.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my sister! doubtless also, the last of my doomed race, will,
      at the same time, complete our redemption by his death; for the will of
      heaven is manifest, that I can only be pardoned, when the last of my
      family shall have disappeared from the face of the earth. To him, holiest
      amongst the holiest&mdash;was reserved the favor of accomplishing this end
      he who has done so much for the salvation of his brethren!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my brother! he who has suffered so much, and without
      complaining, drunk to the dregs the bitter cup of woe&mdash;he, the
      minister of the Lord, who has been his Master&rsquo;s image upon earth&mdash;he
      was fitted for the last instrument of this redemption!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for I feel, my sister, that, at this hour, the last of my
      race, touching victim of slow persecution, is on the point of resigning
      his angelic soul to God. Thus, even to the end, have I been fatal to my
      doomed family. Lord, if Thy mercy is great, Thy anger is great likewise!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage and hope, my brother! Think how after the expiration cometh
      pardon, and pardon is followed by a blessing. The Lord punished, in you
      and your posterity, the artisan rendered wicked by misfortune and
      injustice. He said to you: &lsquo;Go on! without truce or rest&mdash;and
      your labor shall be vain&mdash;and every evening, throwing yourself on the
      hard ground, you shall be no nearer to the end of your eternal course!&rsquo;&mdash;And
      so, for centuries, men without pity have said to the artisan: &lsquo;Work!
      work! work! without truce or rest&mdash;and your labor shall be fruitful
      for all others, but fruitless for yourself&mdash;and every evening,
      throwing yourself on the hard ground, you shall be no nearer to happiness
      and repose; and your wages shall only suffice to keep you alive in pain,
      privation, and poverty!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! alas! will it be always thus?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/30491.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my brother! and instead of weeping over your lost race,
      rejoice for them&mdash;since their death was needed for your redemption,
      and in redeeming you, heaven will redeem the artisan, cursed and feared by
      those&mdash;who have laid on him the iron yoke. Yes, my brother! the time
      draweth nigh&mdash;heaven&rsquo;s mercy will not stop with us alone. Yes,
      I tell you; in us will be rescued both the WOMAN and the SLAVE of these
      modern ages. The trial has been hard, brother; it has lasted throughout
      eighteen centuries; but it will last no longer. Look, my brother! see that
      rosy light, there in the east, gradually spreading over the firmament!
      Thus will rise the sun of the new emancipation&mdash;peaceful, holy,
      great, salutary, fruitful, filling the world with light and vivifying
      heat, like the day-star that will soon appear in heaven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my sister! I feel it. Your words are prophetic. We shall
      close our heavy eyes just as we see the aurora of the day of deliverance&mdash;a
      fair, a splendid day, like that which is about to dawn. Henceforth I will
      only shed tears of pride and glory for those of my race, who have died the
      martyrs of humanity, sacrificed by humanity&rsquo;s eternal enemies&mdash;for
      the true ancestors of the sacrilegious wretches, who blaspheme the name of
      Jesus by giving it to their Company, were the false Scribes and Pharisees,
      whom the Saviour cursed!&mdash;Yes! glory to the descendants of my family,
      who have been the last martyrs offered up by the accomplices of all
      slavery and all despotism, the pitiless enemies of those who wish to
      think, and not to suffer in silence&mdash;of those that would feign enjoy,
      as children of heaven, the gifts which the Creator has bestowed upon all
      the human family. Yes, the day approaches&mdash;the end of the reign of
      our modern Pharisees&mdash;the false priests, who lend their sacrilegious
      aid to the merciless selfishness of the strong against the weak, by daring
      to maintain in the face of the exhaustless treasures of the creation, that
      God has made man for tears, and sorrow, and suffering&mdash;the false
      priests, who are the agents of all oppression, and would bow to the earth,
      in brutish and hopeless humiliation, the brow of every creature. No, no!
      let man lift his head proudly! God made him to be noble and intelligent
      free and happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my brother! your words also are prophetic. Yes, yes! the dawn
      of that bright day approaches, even as the dawn of the natural day which,
      by the mercy of God, will be our last on earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last, my sister; for a strange weakness creeps over me, all
      matter seems dissolving in me, and my soul aspires to mount to heaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine eyes are growing dim, brother; I can scarcely see that light
      in the east, which lately appeared so red.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister! it is through a confused vapor that I now see the valley&mdash;the
      lake&mdash;the woods. My strength fails me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God, brother! the moment of eternal rest is at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it comes, my sister! the sweetness of the everlasting sleep
      takes possession of my senses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, happiness! I am dying&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These eyes are closing, sister!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are then forgiven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgiven!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my brother! may this Divine redemption extend to all those who
      suffer upon the earth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die in peace, my sister! The great day has dawned&mdash;the sun is
      rising&mdash;behold!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the moment when those two voices ceased forever, the sun rose
      radiant and dazzling, and deluged the valley with its beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      To M. C&mdash;P&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      To you, my friend, I dedicated this book. To inscribe it with your name,
      was to assume an engagement that, in the absence of talent, it should be
      at least conscientious, sincere, and of a salutary influence, however
      limited. My object is attained. Some select hearts, like yours, my friend,
      have put into practice the legitimate association of labor, capital, and
      intelligence, and have already granted to their workmen a proportionate
      share in the profits of their industry. Others have laid the foundations
      of Common Dwelling-houses, and one of the chief capitalists of Hamburg has
      favored me with his views respecting an establishment of this kind, on the
      most gigantic scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the dispersion of the members of the Company of Jesus, I have taken
      less part in it than other enemies of the detestable doctrines of Loyola,
      whose influence and authority were far greater than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu, my friend. I could have wished this work more worthy of you; but
      you are indulgent, and will at least give me credit for the intentions
      which dictated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe me, Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      EUGENE SUE.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
